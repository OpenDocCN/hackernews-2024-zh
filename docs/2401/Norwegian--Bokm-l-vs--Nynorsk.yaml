    relatively simple declension and conjugation patterns, while Icelandic kept its
    Old Norse character (with a complex inflection system) in these respects, and
    Faroese did so to a lesser, but still significant, degree. The result was that
    these two insular languages were no more understood by Scandinavians, while the
    three Scandinavian languages developed along parallel lines and kept their mutual
    intelligibility. That, again, made it easy for Danish to pass into Norwegian society
    as the new and modern «state language» not only of Denmark, but also of Norway.

    Scandinavia. This church, with its dependence on Latin as its ecclesiastical language,
    had been dominant throughout the Middle Ages, but it was replaced by state-run
    churches based on Martin Luther’s version of protestantism in the 1530s in Denmark
    (with Norway) (somewhat earlier in Sweden). The most tangible result of this as
    far as language is concerned, was the translation of the Bible (first the New,
    then the Old Testament) into the vernacular languages, a key element in the Lutheran
    reformation. But, whereas Swedes and Icelanders received these holy texts in their
    own languages, Norwegians (and Faroese) had to be content with the Danish version.

    To Norwegians, Danish was the only «correct» written language, while the Norwegian
    dialects were used orally. Gradually, at least from the eighteenth century, the
    elite developed a separate spoken code based on the Danish writing system, but
    since the phonetic difference between Norwegian and Danish dialects was considerable,
    the pronunciation remained markedly Norwegian. Since Danish spelling remained
    more conservative than pronunciation, which developed more and more distinct Danish
    features, Norwegian pronunciation of the common written language often came closer
    to writing than Danish pronunciation. Some contemporary observers in the eighteenth
    century even thought Norwegian elite pronunciation of Danish to be better than
    what one could hear in Denmark proper, even though Norway was only a province

  zh: 因此，古老的北欧文字在十六世纪灭绝了。对挪威人来说，丹麦语是唯一的“正确”的书面语言，而挪威方言则用于口头交流。至少从十八世纪开始，精英阶层逐渐发展出一种基于丹麦书写系统的独立口语代码，但由于挪威语和丹麦语方言之间的语音差异相当大，发音仍然明显地保持挪威口音。由于丹麦拼写比发音更保守，发展出越来越明显的丹麦特色，挪威人对通用书面语的发音经常比丹麦发音更接近书写。一些十八世纪的当代观察家甚至认为，挪威精英对丹麦语的发音比在丹麦本土听到的还要好，尽管挪威只是一个省份，而哥本哈根是大都会。

    and Greenland remained with Denmark). The Norwegian elite tried to prevent this
    by staging a national revolution, arranging elections for a national convent,
    which met in order to declare Norway an independent kingdom and draft its constitution.
    Sweden did not accept this, however, and after a brief war, a compromise was found.
    Norway was allowed to keep its new constitution, but an extraordinary parliament
    had to be elected and to convene in order to make adjustments in the constitution
    which allowed for the king of Sweden to be elected king also of Norway. By this,
    Norway acquired the status of separate state, although only semi-independent under

    how to designate it), was *Ivar Aasen* (1813-1896), a crofter’s son from Western
    Norway who was given opportunity to study different languages and even drafted
    a grammar of his own dialect. He was given a scholarship to travel around in Norway
    and describe the spoken dialects, which had never been done that systematically
    before. His travels took place from 1842 till 1846, and he published a comparative
    dialect grammar of Norwegian in 1848 and a dictionary in 1850\. After that, he
    continued his studies with an allowance from the parliament, and in 1853 he published
    an attempted codified version based on the common features of the dialects in
    comparison with Old Norse, which was seen as the common ancestor of all the dialects.
    Since Western Norwegian dialects had remained (relatively) closest to the Old
    Norse structure, his standard came to resemble these dialects the most. Even in
    these relatively conservative dialects, however, the Old Norse morphology had
    been largely simplified.

    tales, and a translated Icelandic saga. Others followed up publishing literary
    works, journalism and so on. Textbooks for schools in it were also compiled and
    published. In 1885, a parliamentary decree gave it official status, and from 1892,
    it might be taught in schools after a local decision process. About 1900, Norway

    for its norwegianization was developing in nationalist and radical circles, and
    above all among teachers, who pointed out difficulties in the teaching of the

    behind the movement was *Knud Knudsen* (1812-1895), a secondary school teacher
    living in the capital ([then Christiania, now Oslo](#capital)). He worked for
    a reform where the spelling of Dano-Norwegian was brought closer to the daily
    pronunciation of the educated elite (in opposition to the formal and ceremonial
    speech of the same elite, which approached Danish writing to a significant degree).
    Knudsen and his followers used both nationalistic and pedagogical arguments for
    a norwegianization of the language, partly on the basis of educated daily speech
    of the elite, as we just mentioned, partly including some features from more popular
    dialects in the central and urban areas of the country. They envisaged a Norwegian

    group (together with Swedish). They used to be mutually intelligible, which they
    still are to a large extent, at least in writing. The oral intelligibility is,
    however, reduced, because Danish phonology has developed in a very separate direction
    which we cannot explore further here. Danish pronunciation sounds extremely «blurred»
    in Norwegian (and Swedish) ears. The Danish written language, however, is conservative,
    based upon conventions that were developed from the sixteenth century on. In fact,
    Danish orthography today reflects a phonological system which resembles Norwegian
    Bokmål speech more than modern Danish proper (especially if pronounced with a
    Norwegian south coast accent, because this part of Norway had some early phonetic
    developments in common with the then contemporary Danish, probably because of
    language contacts between both sides of the Skagerrak during late medieval times).
    This means that when Norwegians read a Danish written text aloud, they can read
    it with their own Norwegian pronunciation, as if it were a traditional Bokmål
    text with a few deviations which are reflected in the spelling. To Norwegians,
    this feels almost like reading a (Dano-)Norwegian text from the nineteenth century.

    *Riksmål* by German *Reichssprache*). Both in German and in Scandinavian the meaning
    of *Reich* / *rike* was and is somewhat hazy; it may imply both ‘state’ (in the

    ‘nation’. Words with the prefix *riks*- in Norwegian often imply ‘nationwide’
    as opposed to ‘regional’, the latter encompassing only parts of the country, such
    as province or municipality. *Riks*- thus represents the highest in a hierarchy
    of units. Even some Nynorsk adherents wanted to call their variety *Riksmål* because
    of the formal and social position this word implies. One of their more militant
    slogans was: *Nynorsk som einaste riksmål i landet!* ‘Nynorsk as the only *Riksmål*

    / *rike*的含义都有些模糊；它既可以意味着‘国家’（在欧洲制度上的意义，而不是美国的意义），也可以意味着‘国家’和‘民族’。在挪威，具有前缀*riks*-的词通常意味着‘全国范围的’，而不是‘地区性的’，后者仅包括国家的部分，例如省份或市镇。因此，*Riks*-代表了层次单位中的最高级别。甚至一些新挪威语的支持者也希望将他们的变体称为*Riksmål*，因为这个词所暗示的正式和社会地位。其中一个他们更激进的口号是：*Nynorsk
    som einaste riksmål i landet!*‘新挪威语作为这个国家唯一的*Riksmål*！’但实际上，*Riksmål*在二十世纪初被确认为我们现在称为*Bokmål*的语言的通常名称。
- en: The change from *Riksmål* to *Bokmål* took place in 1929, when it was effectuated
    by Parliament. This was the first time a formal decision concerning the names
    of the language varieties was taken by an authoritative body. In informal speech,
    however, *Riksmål*had been firmly established, and it remained in use. After WW2,
    when the struggle about the amalgamation policy hardened, a struggle about the
    naming also developed. The resistance movement defending the traditional (thus
    Danish-like) forms of the language now codified a separate version of the standard,
    based on the traditional variety of the 1917 reform (see above), but accepting
    some (minor) features of the 1938 spelling (which had already been accepted in
    general usage). The movement itself was called the *Riksmål* movement, and the
    word *Riksmål* therefore marked an ideology, not only a linguistic variety. The
    term *Bokmål*, on the other hand, was now used to designate the officially standardized
    variety of the language, which was marked by much optionality, so that *Bokmål*
    encompassed a variety which included many *Nynorsk*-derived and dialect-inspired
    forms *as well as* a variety of a more traditional kind, but less traditional
    than the pure *Riksmål*. This pattern remained until the 1980s, when the official
    language policy had become more accommodating towards the *Riksmål* movement.
    This meant that the border lines between the «oppositional» *Riksmål* and the
    state-run *Bokmål* became increasingly diffuse. *Bokmål* itself had been polarized
    into two varieties with numerous transition forms, marked by the adjectives *moderate*
    and *radical*. *Moderate Bokmål* was the most *Riksmål*-marked, *radical Bokmål*
    was stretching towards *Nynorsk* and popular speech. The problem was that official
    moderate *Bokmål* resembled *Riksmål*more and more, while radical *Bokmål* was
    pertinently non-*Riksmål*. From the other side, the *Riksmål* movement opened
    its language codification towards moderate *Bokmål*, accepting a (limited) number
    of non-*Riksmål* forms where the *Riksmål* equivalents had clearly been marginalized
    in general usage, thus blurring the borderline towards moderate Bokmål even more.

    did *Nynorsk* begin to be used as the designation of the language variety which
    had evolved from Aasen’s works and subsequent reforms, the variety, thus, which
    at the time was officially called *Landsmål*. The parliamentary decision of the
    names of the varieties in 1929, however, also formally introduced *Nynorsk* as
    the name of Landsmål, and unlike *Bokmål* for the other variety, *Nynorsk* soon

- en: As I have already stated, the idea of amalgamating Bokmål and Nynorsk (I use
    these names irrespective of which period I treat, for the sake of simplicity)
    into a future Samnorsk originated at the turn of the century (around 1900). This
    was supposed to be attained through a gradual process of mutual linguistic rapprochement
    (*tilnærming*) between the two varieties. I shall now show how this was planned
    to be done, and assess the results.

  zh: 正如我已经说明的，将书面挪威语和尼诺斯克合并的想法（无论我处理的是哪个时期，我都使用这些名称，为了简单起见）成为未来Samnorsk的来源于世纪之交（大约1900年左右）。这应该通过两种语言逐渐相互语言接近（*tilnærming*）的过程来实现。现在我将展示如何计划做到这一点，并评估结果。
- en: The basic condition for such a policy to take effect, was the relatively great
    similarity between the two written varieties and the dialect patterns of different
    parts of the country. Bokmål was, as we have seen, based on a phonetically Norwegian
    spoken variety of the Danish written standard. Its users lived in close contact
    with locally spoken dialects in different areas, but the most important area here
    was the south-east, where the capital is placed. This southeastern popular speech
    was closer to neighbouring Swedish and Danish varieties than the speech of Western
    and Northern Norway. Ivar Aasen, however, based his Nynorsk standard on the dialect
    forms most closely resembling Old Norse, and they were best preserved in Western
    Norway and some inland mountain areas in Southern Norway. Thereby, maximum distance
    was sought between the two written varieties, although they were still mutually
    intelligible.

  zh: 实行这样一项政策的基本条件是，两种书面语的相似程度相对较大，以及全国各地方言的方言特点。正如我们所见，书面挪威语基于一个音系上与挪威口语相近的丹麦标准书面语。它的用户与不同地区的当地口语方言保持密切联系，但这里最重要的地区是位于资本所在的东南部。这种东南部的口语与瑞典和丹麦的邻近方言更接近，而不是西部和北部挪威的口音。然而，伊瓦尔·奥森（Ivar
    Aasen）基于尼诺斯克标准的是最接近古挪威语的方言形式，它们在西挪威和一些南部内陆山区保存得最好。因此，寻求将两种书面语的最大距离，尽管它们仍然可以互相理解。
- en: The Nynorsk movement, on the other hand, had the ambition to unite all Nynorsk
    dialects and their speakers in a common Norwegian standard language. The archaizing
    tendency in the codification sprang from the view that the most common features
    were those that reigned at the stage when the dialects split from each other;
    Old Norse was conceived of as a unified language without or almost without dialectal
    variation (a conception which later research in the medieval Norwegian manuscript
    literature has considerably modified). Ivar Aasen’s Nynorsk standard was in many
    ways an impressive creation by its systematicity and its aesthetic qualities,
    which made it well suited to poetic and artistic purposes, and some of its users
    reached a high literary quality in their works. But in its original form, Aasen’s
    standard was too good to be realized by a whole language community in practice,
    and against his warnings, an increasing degree of variability and adjustments
    towards different dialect groups became a characteristic of much Nynorsk usage.
    In other words, it proved to be more flexible than Aasen would have liked, since
    flexibility often goes at the cost of systematicity.

  zh: 尼诺尔斯克运动，另一方面，有志于将所有尼诺尔斯克方言及其使用者统一为一种通用的挪威标准语言。在法典化过程中出现的古风潮流源于这样的观点：最常见的特征是在方言相互分裂时占主导地位的特征；古诺尔斯语被构想为一种几乎没有方言变化的统一语言（这一构想在后来对中世纪挪威手稿文学的研究中得到了相当程度的修正）。伊瓦尔·奥森的尼诺尔斯克标准在很多方面都是一种令人印象深刻的创造，因其系统性和美学特质而适用于诗歌和艺术创作，其中一些使用者在其作品中达到了很高的文学水准。但是，奥森标准的原始形式在实践中对整个语言社区来说过于完美了，与他的警告相反，越来越多的变异程度和对不同方言群体的调整成为许多尼诺尔斯克使用的特点。换句话说，它被证明比奥森所希望的更灵活，因为灵活性往往以系统性为代价。
- en: The same happened in Bokmål, as southeastern dialect features crept into the
    language, particularly in literary and informal functions. This tendency was strengthened
    by the demographic development of Norway, since the population in and around Oslo
    expanded more rapidly than elsewhere in the country (where urban centers like
    Bergen, Trondheim etc. also grew at the cost of their rural surroundings). As
    the twentieth century wore on, the linguistic features of southeastern popular
    speech were seen as markedly expansive. This was the key which unlocked the language
    to the rapprochement policy with full amalgamation, *Samnorsk*, as the future
    goal; the catchword which expressed this goal was «linguistic unification» (*språklig
    samling*). Through the introducing of popular southeastern dialect forms in the
    two official standards, Bokmål became more representative in a social sense, less
    onesidedly attached to the speech of societal elite groups – which many saw as
    an asset when the labour movement also expanded and gradually transformed the
    society in the direction of an increasingly elaborate welfare society. Nynorsk
    also gained in its representativity, but here in a geographic sense, by accepting
    Southeastern forms on a par with the Western ones (also northern dialect forms
    were accepted and taken more into use during these years). This was the policy
    which reached in zenith in 1938.

  zh: 同样的情况也发生在博克马尔语中，东南部方言特征渗入了语言中，特别是在文学和非正式场合。挪威的人口发展加强了这一倾向，因为奥斯陆及其周围地区的人口增长速度比国内其他地区（诸如卑尔根、特隆赫姆等城市中心也在以其农村周边地区为代价增长）更快。随着二十世纪的推移，东南部通俗语的语言特征被视为显著扩张的标志。这是解锁语言以实现全面融合的和解政策的关键；表达这一目标的口号是“语言统一”（*språklig
    samling*）。通过在两个官方标准中引入流行的东南部方言形式，博克马尔语在社会意义上变得更具代表性，不再单方面地与社会精英群体的言语紧密相连——当劳工运动也在扩张并逐渐将社会转变为一个日益复杂的福利社会时，许多人将这看作是一种资产。尼诺尔斯克也在地理意义上获得了代表性，通过将东南部的形式与西部的形式并列接受（在这些年里，也接受了北部方言形式并更多地使用）。这是在1938年达到顶峰的政策。

    00 页上描述过。在这里，我将概述从五十年代开始的主要发展力量。
- en: The resistance phase was strongest in the 1950s. The language planners, viewed
    in hindsight, had underestimated the forces of habit and tradition among language
    users. Large groups of people, not least in the traditional social and cultural
    elite, felt that an authoritarian government was in the process of taking their
    language from them by forcing them to use forms they felt to be strange and vulgar.
    This provoked widespread resistance, especially in the cities and towns, where
    the traditional Bokmål had its strongest position.

  zh: 五十年代的反抗阶段最为强烈。事后看来，语言规划者低估了语言使用者中习惯和传统的力量。大批人群，尤其是传统社会文化精英，认为威权政府正在通过强迫他们使用他们觉得奇怪和粗俗的形式来剥夺他们的语言。这引发了广泛的反抗，特别是在城市和城镇，那里传统的博克马尔语占据了最强的地位。
- en: A big additional problem is indicated by the use of the adjective «vulgar» –
    since many of the new forms were not necessarily brand-new and unknown, but had
    been in traditional use in popular dialectal speech, associated with urban and
    rural working class. To the Labour Party, this was a reason for promoting them,
    to reduce social prejudice also in language matters, but even among those who
    used such forms in speech, they gave a connotation of lacking dignity. People
    in particular resented that their children were taught in school that such forms
    were standard, and the language of school textbooks was at the heart of the struggle.
    The school was to a dominant degree state-run, and there were regulations as to
    which kinds of books could be used as textbooks, also regarding linguistic usage.
    These regulations were the first to be softened and modified in face of the resistance
    of hundred thousands of parents – already in the fifties.

  zh: 使用形容词«粗俗»指出了一个重大的额外问题——因为许多新形式并不一定是全新和未知的，而是在流行方言中已经有传统使用，并且与城市和农村工人阶级相关。对工党来说，这是促进它们的原因，以减少社会偏见，包括语言问题，但即使是那些在言语中使用这些形式的人们，它们也带有缺乏尊严的含义。人们特别反感的是，他们的孩子被教导这些形式是标准的，学校教科书的语言是斗争的核心。学校在很大程度上是由国家管理的，并且有关于哪种书籍可以用作教科书的规定，也涉及语言使用。这些规定是在数十万父母的抵抗面前首先软化和修改的——早在五十年代就开始了。
- en: 'However, an opposite development took place in a more discrete and less visible
    way, namely a growing acceptance of many of those new forms which were already
    most widespread in speech and thus less tainted with the «vulgarity» stamp. In
    usage, a difference developed partly along political lines, for example in the
    press: The most conservative papers followed the private *Riksmål* (see above)
    norm, while more centrist and radical ones kept inside the official standard,
    using the optionality to such a degree that they preferred «moderate» forms to
    the more «radical», but still keeping a distance to «Riksmål». The long-term result
    was that the most marked «radical» (dialectal or Nynorsk-marked) forms disappeared
    in use, although remaining as optional «standard» forms in the dictionaries and
    school spelling lists (until 2005), while more «moderate» rapprochement forms
    gradually gained currency in use and were regarded as acceptable and «neutral»
    in the language struggle. «Riksmål» counterparts of these forms, through this
    development, were increasingly seen as «snobbish» or «old-fashioned». A kind of
    «middle course» between the «radical Bokmål» and «Riksmål» thus developed and
    became increasingly dominant.'

  zh: 然而，另一种相反的发展以一种更加不明显和不可见的方式发生，即对那些在言语中已经最为普遍且因此不带有“粗俗”标签的新形式的越来越多的接受。在使用上，差异在一定程度上沿着政治路线发展，例如在新闻界：最保守的报纸遵循私人的*Riksmål*规范，而更中间派和激进派则保持在官方标准之内，以至于他们更倾向于“温和”的形式而不是更“激进”的形式，但仍然与“Riksmål”保持距离。长期结果是，最明显的“激进”（方言或Nynorsk标记）形式在使用中消失了，尽管它们作为可选的“标准”形式仍然存在于词典和学校拼写列表中（直到2005年），而更“温和”的和解形式逐渐在使用中流行起来，并被视为可接受和“中立”的语言斗争。通过这一发展，“Riksmål”的这些形式越来越被视为“势利”或“过时”。因此，在“激进Bokmål”和“Riksmål”之间形成了一种“中间路线”，并逐渐占据主导地位。
- en: In the 1970s, a strong anti-authoritarian movement with leftist inclinations
    among the youth challenged the Riksmål movement, favouring *Nynorsk* and the use
    of dialects, but also promoting the use of «vulgar» forms from urban (above all
    Oslo) working class speech. This wave waned again after 1980, when the political
    right gained power within economic and social policy, but continued dialect use
    and a freer attitude to the written forms strengthened the «middle course», where
    optionality between popular forms and more traditional forms continued to exist
    and established itself more permanently. The new trends promoted, again, in particular
    by the youth, led to a more relaxed view on language, leading to a more informal
    style in writing which favoured many of the popular forms in Bokmål, in so far
    as they had already gained currency in use. Both on the «Riksmål» side and on
    the opposite «rapprochement» side, many forms simply gradually disappeared from
    use, being seen as old-fashioned. The new Bokmål spelling of 2005 based itself
    on these new attitudes to the language form and the usage that developed from
    it. The present trends in language development are dominated by generations that
    were unborn during the intense language struggle phases, and therefore relatively
    untainted by the feelings and attitudes of their grandparents’ generation.

  zh: 在20世纪70年代，一股带有左倾倾向的强烈的反权威主义青年运动挑战了挪威书语运动，支持*Nynorsk*和方言的使用，但同时也促进了来自城市（尤其是奥斯陆）工人阶级口语的“粗俗”形式的使用。这股浪潮在1980年后逐渐减弱，当时右翼政治在经济和社会政策方面占据主导地位，但方言的使用和对书面形式更为自由的态度加强了“中间路线”，在这条路线上，普及形式和更传统形式之间的选择性继续存在并更加牢固地确立下来。新的趋势，再次主要由年轻人推动，导致了对语言的更加宽松的看法，使得书写风格更加非正式，有利于Bokmål中的许多普及形式，因为它们已经在使用中流行起来。在“Riksmål”一边和相反的“和解”一边，许多形式都逐渐从使用中消失了，被视为过时。2005年的新Bokmål拼写是基于这些对语言形式的新态度和从中发展出来的用法的。目前语言发展的趋势主要由那些在激烈的语言斗争阶段尚未出生的一代主导，因此相对不受他们祖父母一代的情感和态度的影响。

- en: The first is *stabilization*, which is clearly the aim of the most recent spelling
    reforms. Official policy is now to maintain Bokmål and Nynorsk as separate standards,
    although Bokmål is vastly dominant and the Nynorsk community actively struggling
    to keep its language strong. As a cultural elite language, Nynorsk asserts itself
    well, but among the «grassroot» youth, active endeavours are still needed to maintain
    it. The official spellings of the two varieties seem to stabilize on a course
    in between the most traditional styles of the past and the most «radical» elements
    of the rapprochement policy, which now also is seen as «old-fashioned».

  zh: 第一个是*稳定*，这显然是最新拼写改革的目标。官方政策现在是将书面语和尼诺斯克作为独立的标准维护，尽管书面语远远占主导地位，而尼诺斯克社区则积极努力保持其语言的强大。作为一种文化精英语言，尼诺斯克表现良好，但在“草根”青年中，仍然需要积极的努力来维持它。两种方言的官方拼写似乎在最传统的过去风格和现在也被视为“过时”的融合政策的最“激进”元素之间稳定下来。
- en: The second catchword is *fragmentation*. In the social spheres outside the official
    (both governmental and private) ones, many new stylistic levels are developed
    and explored, often based on traditional dialect speech, but also exploiting resources
    taken from English and from the urban registers based on non-Western immigrant
    languages. These oral styles are now eagerly used even in writing, by young people
    and in the so-called social electronic media. Here, creativity abounds, and new
    linguistic resources constantly prop up. How this all will influence developments
    in the future, is impossible to indicate now.

  zh: 第二个关键词是*分裂*。在官方（政府和私人）以外的社会领域，许多新的文体水平正在发展和探索，通常是基于传统的方言，但也利用了从英语和基于非西方移民语言的城市注册表中获取的资源。这些口头风格现在甚至在写作中都被年轻人和所谓的社交电子媒体积极使用。在这里，创造力丰富，新的语言资源不断涌现。这一切将如何影响未来的发展，现在是不可能指示的。
- en: The final catch-word is *accommodation*, and this applies to the informal spoken
    language. While dialects have been widely used in Norway, also in official and
    national contexts, at least since the seventies, they have not remained unchanged.
    They are constantly influenced by neighbouring dialects, in particular the dialect
    of the nearest city, developing into larger units, more regional than purely local,
    as before. They are also influenced by the standard languages, mostly Bokmål,
    but in Western Norway also by Nynorsk (in the regions where people are accustomed
    to see Nynorsk in writing). A long-term *oral* amalgamation into a kind of *Samnorsk*
    is possible (independently of any official policy), but so is a future stable
    coexistence of several regiolects in the different parts of the country.

  zh: 最终的关键词是*适应*，这适用于非正式的口语。虽然挪威方言自七十年代以来已被广泛用于正式和国家场合，它们并没有保持不变。它们不断受到邻近方言的影响，特别是最近城市的方言，发展成更大的单元，更多地是地区性的而不仅仅是纯粹的本地化。它们也受到标准语言的影响，主要是书面语，但在西挪威也受到尼诺斯克（在人们习惯于书面语中见到尼诺斯克的地区）的影响。长期的*口头*融合成一种*山诺斯克*是可能的（与任何官方政策无关），但在该国不同地区几个方言的未来稳定共存也是可能的。
