- en: Donald Bayley (1921-2020) was born into humble circumstances, the son of a sheet
    metal worker at the tram depot in Walsall, Staffordshire. He was awarded a scholarship
    to St Mary's Grammar School, Walsall (where he was taught mathematics by Alan
    Turing's friend James Atkins) and from there won another scholarship to read electrical
    engineering at Birmingham University, graduating in 1942 with a first-class degree.
    As it was wartime, he was commissioned into the Royal Electrical and Mechanical
    Engineers (REME) where he excelled in all his courses and soon became an obvious
    choice to assist Turing on a new top-secret project. Thus, the young Bayley, scarcely
    more than a university student, found himself working with an acknowledged mathematical
    genius on project 'Delilah' (so named by Turing's lab-mate Robin Gandy after the
    infamous deceiver of men), the aim being to design a portable voice encryption
    system, 'the first to be based on rigorous cryptographic principles' (Bayley,
    letter to Jack Copeland, 1997).

- en: 'Turing had already been working on Delilah at Hanslope Park, just five miles
    from Bletchley, for six months before Bayley joined him in March 1944\. The two
    men were to become close friends but as Bayley recalls, his first meeting with
    Turing was inauspicious: ''...He was a bit slapdash; I was very well-organised...
    This chap had his shirt hanging out. There were resistors and capacitors, as fast
    as he''d soldered one on another would fall off. It was a spider''s nest of stuff
    – a complete mess. We made up a ''breadboard'' sheet of plywood, you soldered
    between strips of metal, to make up the board. He hadn''t worked on it like that
    at all, soldered anyhow, and hoped they''d hold together. He was annoyed I mentioned
    his shirt hanging out. He took it for granted. He said I shouldn''t have mentioned
    it...'' (Dermot Turing, *Prof: Alan Turing Decoded*, 2016, p.142).'

    我非常有条理... 这个家伙的衬衫挂出来了。 电阻器和电容器，他一焊一个，另一个就会掉下来。 这是一团混乱。 我们做了一块‘面包板’，用胶合板，你在金属条之间焊接，以制作板子。
    他根本没有像那样工作过，随便焊接，希望它们能够在一起。 他很生气我提到了他的衬衫挂出来了。 他认为这是理所当然的。 他说我不应该提到它...”（德莫特·图灵，《教授：阿兰·图灵解密》，2016年，第142页）。
- en: '''I admired the originality of his mind'', Bayley said - ''he taught me a great
    deal, for which I have always been grateful'' (letter to Jack Copeland, 1997).
    Their main task was to design and build Delilah''s circuits: ''...He had realised
    that it could be synthesised out of standard components. This was an entirely
    new idea to Don Bayley, as was the mathematics of Fourier theory that had been
    used to attack it. It was a tough problem, which Alan said had involved spending
    a whole month in working out the roots of a seventh-degree equation... he was
    able to tell his new assistant a good deal about the mathematics of circuit design...
    But it needed Don to bring his practical experience to bear on the problem...
    He also kept beautifully neat notes of their experiments, and generally kept Alan
    in order...'' (Andrew Hodges, *Alan Turing: The Enigma*, London, 1992, p.350).

    这对于唐·贝利来说是一个全新的想法，正如傅里叶理论的数学被用来攻击它。 这是一个棘手的问题，阿兰说已经花了整整一个月的时间来解决一个七次方程的根... 他能够告诉他的新助手有关电路设计的数学的许多东西...
    但需要唐来运用他的实践经验来解决这个问题... 他还非常整齐地记录了他们的实验，并且通常让阿兰保持秩序...”（安德鲁·霍奇斯，《阿兰·图灵：谜团》，伦敦，1992年，第350页）。

    the three enjoying long countryside walks together in their spare time. In the
    interests of doing something more intellectually improving, in the winter of 1944,
    Bayley, Gandy and Alan Wesley commandeered a ''...singularly cold classroom...''

    Wesley）霸占了汉斯洛普公园的一个“...格外冷的教室...”（Hodges，第352页），组织了由图灵讲授的关于数学方法的夜间讲座：“...主要是关于傅里叶分析和相关的使用复数微积分的材料。他用‘卷积’的概念来说明......

    a taped speech by Winston Churchill. It was proved to work satisfactorily ('...it
    did all that could be expected of it...' Bayley later wrote to Jack Copeland),
    but the speech quality was poor. Germany fell in May 1945, not long after Delilah
    was finished and, too late to be of use in the war, it was not put into production.
    When Turing left for the National Physical Laboratory in October 1945, he intimated

- en: 'In 1943, cryptology''s new frontier was the encryption of speech. Turing extended
    existing text-encryption technology to the new territory of speech-encryption.
    Text-based machines such as the German SZ (which Turing and his Bletchley Park
    colleagues broke in 1942) worked by adding obscuring characters, called ''key'',
    to the plain-text message. The systematic rules of letter-addition that were hard-wired
    into the SZ, would automatically generate the encrypted form of the message. Key
    was produced by a Key Generator situated inside the SZ cipher machine. The Key
    Generator was a system of twelve wheels: as the wheels turned, they churned out
    a continual stream of seemingly random letters and other keyboard characters.
    The wheels in the receiver''s machine were synchronised with those in the sender''s,
    and so produced the same letters and characters of key. The receiving machine
    stripped the key off the incoming message, revealing the plain-text.'

  zh: 1943年，密码学的新领域是语音加密。图灵将现有的文本加密技术扩展到语音加密的新领域。像德国SZ这样的基于文本的机器（图灵和他的布莱切利公园同事在1942年破解了）通过向明文消息添加称为“密钥”的混淆字符来工作。嵌入在SZ中的字母添加的系统规则将自动生成消息的加密形式。密钥由位于SZ密码机内部的密钥生成器产生。密钥生成器是一个由十二个轮子组成的系统：当轮子转动时，它们会不断产生一系列看似随机的字母和其他键盘字符。接收机中的轮子与发送机中的轮子同步，因此产生相同的字母和密钥字符。接收机剥离了传入消息上的密钥，揭示了明文。
- en: Delilah added obscuring key to spoken words, much as the SZ added obscuring
    key to written words. In Delilah's case, the key was a stream of pseudorandom
    numbers (i.e., random-seeming numbers but not truly random). Delilah's key was
    produced a Key Generator consisting of a system of five rotating wheels and some
    very sophisticated electronic circuitry. As with the SZ, the Key Generator of
    the receiver's Delilah had to be synchronized with that of the sender's, so that
    both machines produced identical key. The first step in the encryption process
    was to 'discretize' the speech, turning it into a sequence of individual numbers.
    Each of these numbers corresponded to the speech signal's voltage at that particular
    moment in time. Delilah then added key to these numbers and this created the encrypted
    form of the speech. (Delilah's additions were simply of numbers to numbers—as
    opposed to the addition of letters to letters in the SZ—and moreover 'carries'
    were ignored.) The encrypted speech would be transmitted automatically to the
    second Delilah at the receiving end of the communications link. The receiving
    Delilah then stripped the key away from the incoming transmission, and the resulting
    numbers (specifying voltages) were used to reproduce the original speech. The
    result was whistly and full of background noise, but usually intelligible—although
    if the machine made a mistake, there would be 'a sudden crack like a rifle shot',
    Turing and Bayley reported.

  zh: Delilah给口语添加了混淆密钥，类似于SZ给书面文字添加了混淆密钥。在Delilah的情况下，密钥是一串伪随机数（即看起来随机但实际上并非真正随机）。Delilah的密钥是由一个由五个旋转轮和一些非常复杂的电子电路组成的密钥生成器产生的。与SZ一样，接收端的Delilah的密钥生成器必须与发送端的密钥生成器同步，以便两台机器生成相同的密钥。加密过程的第一步是将语音“离散化”，将其转换为一系列单个数字。这些数字中的每一个都对应于该特定时刻的语音信号电压。然后Delilah向这些数字添加密钥，这样就创建了语音的加密形式。（Delilah的添加只是将数字添加到数字上——与SZ中将字母添加到字母上不同——而且忽略了“进位”）。加密语音将自动传输到通信链路的第二个Delilah。接收端的Delilah然后从传入的传输中去除密钥，并使用结果数字（指定电压）来重现原始语音。结果是带有哨声和背景噪声的，但通常是可理解的——尽管如果机器犯了错误，就会有“突然的枪声般的裂缝”，图灵和贝利报告。

    Then, at the other end of the communications link, these numbers could be used
    to reproduce the sound-waves. This was a process that communications engineers

- en: Most probably Turing wrote out the proof of the theorem as a tutorial for Bayley.
    Turing's two handwritten pages are based ultimately on the work of the French
    mathematician Fourier (1768–1830) and the concept of a 'Fourier transform'. This
    decomposes a sound-wave (or any waveform) into individual frequencies that make
    it up (just as a musical chord can be decomposed into the frequencies of the individual
    notes that make the chord up). In their report on Delilah, Turing and Bayley noted
    that 'the human ear works on a Fourier analysis basis'. The theorem itself goes
    back to work in the 1920s and 1930s, after which, in 1940, Claude Shannon of Bell
    Labs in New York wrote his now famous article sketching this earlier work and
    giving his own formulation and proof of the theorem, which he called the 'sampling
    theorem' (his article was not published until 1949). It is highly likely that
    Turing and Shannon discussed the theorem while Turing was visiting Bell Labs in
    1943.

    Delilah 的报告中，图灵和贝利指出“人耳是以傅立叶分析为基础工作的”。定理本身可以追溯到20世纪20年代和30年代的工作，在此之后，1940年，纽约贝尔实验室的克劳德·香农撰写了他现在著名的文章，勾勒了这个早期工作并给出了自己的定理陈述和证明，他称之为“采样定理”（他的文章直到1949年才发表）。很有可能图灵和香农在1943年图灵访问贝尔实验室期间讨论了该定理。

  zh: 贝利关于图灵晚餐后课程的手写记录单独固定在装订册中。它由 1-180 号记有序号的笔记页组成，以及两张未编号的红色墨水的起始页，其中包含标准数学形式的参考列表。这份文件具有重要意义，将被指定为
    '图灵为电气工程师讲授的高等数学课程'。它代表了目前已知的图灵最广泛的单一作品。实际上，这些笔记构成了一本关于电路工程师高级数学的教科书 —— 简洁、选择性，并且现在当然已经非常过时了
    —— 没有疑问，贝利并不是图灵观众中唯一的成员，因为汉斯洛普有许多从事电气工程的工程师。
- en: Electronics itself does not figure much in the lectures. There are only passing
    references (e.g., page 49 mentions 'Cath Foll', referring to a circuit called
    a cathode follower). Bayley liked to relate that Turing had only recently taught
    himself elementary electronics, by studying an RCA vacuum tube manual while he
    was crossing the Atlantic from New York to Liverpool, in March 1943\. This cannot
    be quite true, because Turing made some use of electronics in his 1940 document
    on Enigma and the Bombe (known at Bletchley Park as 'Prof's Book', 'Prof' being
    his nickname). Nevertheless Turing's knowledge of practical electronics was almost
    certainly inferior to his assistant's, at least initially, since Bayley was versed
    in electronics at university, and moreover was involved with radar before his
    transfer to Hanslope. When it came to mathematical matters, however, the situation
    was very different. These lectures demonstrate the extent and maturity of Turing's
    knowledge of the mathematical side of electrical circuit design. It was knowledge
    that was essential to the Delilah project, most especially to the design of the
    all-important Key Generator.

  zh: 电子学本身在讲座中并不占据很大篇幅。只有零星的提及（例如，第 49 页提到了 'Cath Foll'，指的是一个名为阴极跟随器的电路）。贝利喜欢提到，图灵在
    1943 年 3 月从纽约到利物浦的大西洋横渡途中，最近才通过研读 RCA 电子管手册自学了基础电子学知识。这可能不完全属实，因为图灵在 1940 年的《恩尼格玛和炸弹》文件中就已经使用了一些电子学知识（在
    Bletchley Park 被称为 '教授的书'，'教授'是他的绰号）。然而，无论如何，图灵对实际电子学的了解几乎肯定不如他的助手，至少起初是这样，因为贝利在大学里就学过电子学，而且在调到汉斯洛普之前还涉足雷达技术。然而，当涉及到数学问题时，情况就大不相同了。这些讲座展示了图灵在电路设计的数学方面的知识的广度和成熟度。这些知识对
    Delilah 项目至关重要，尤其是对于重要的密钥生成器的设计。

- en: a) Two foolscap pages covered with what appears to be Turing's handwriting.
    Bayley's explanatory note inside the front cover of the ring binder (see Item
    vi) stated 'Some p.p. in his [i.e. Turing's] own hand'. Each foolscap page seems
    to concern a different electrical problem. The first begins with a diagram of
    a network of inductors and capacitors. An 'L' written above the first inductor
    indicates that its inductance is L units. Below the diagram, Turing multiplied
    two matrices together, one matrix concerning inductance and the other capacitance.
    He then drew another diagram, presumably representing the same network, showing
    input and output voltages v1 and v2\. There follow calculations involving v1 and
    v2\. The second foolscap page gives an equation for 'Cut-off' and investigates
    behaviour 'Below cut-off'.

  zh: a) 两张大纸张上似乎是图灵的手写。Bayley在环形夹的正面内的解释性注释（见项目 vi）中说明：“一些（即图灵的）手写”。每张大纸似乎涉及不同的电气问题。第一张以电感器和电容器网络的图表开头。在第一个电感器上面写着'L'，表示它的电感是L单位。在图表下面，图灵把两个矩阵相乘，一个矩阵涉及电感，另一个涉及电容。然后，他画了另一个图表，可能表示相同的网络，显示输入和输出电压v1和v2。接着是涉及v1和v2的计算。第二张大纸给出了“截止”的方程，并调查了“截止以下”的行为。
- en: b) Three pages of notes in Bayley's handwriting. Two of these pages (one of
    which is filled with writing on both sides) contain summary notes concerning certain
    of the topics covered in Turing's Lectures on Advanced Mathematics for Electrical
    Engineers (Item vi). Perhaps Bayley used these as reference sheets. At the top
    of the third page, on the right, Bayley has written '(Submarine cable See p.40
    of notebook)'. The heading 'Submarine Cable' is found on page 40 of Turing's Lectures
    on Advanced Mathematics for Electrical Engineers and this page and the next concern
    the mathematics of transmission along such a cable. Bayley's third page extends
    the calculations on page 41 of the Lectures and shows a calculation of the output
    that is produced by an input of a unit pulse.

  zh: b) Bayley手写的三页笔记。其中两页（其中一面写满了文字）包含了关于图灵的《高级数学讲义》（项目 vi）中涉及的某些主题的摘要笔记。也许Bayley把它们用作参考资料。在第三页的顶部，右边，Bayley写着“(潜艇电缆见笔记本第40页)”。“潜艇电缆”标题出现在图灵的《高级数学讲义》的第40页上，这一页和下一页涉及沿着这种电缆的传输的数学。Bayley的第三页延续了《讲义》第41页上的计算，并显示了由单位脉冲输入产生的输出的计算。

- en: 'The first folio is crammed on both sides with mathematics. It begins with the
    underlined heading ''Problem''. Turing then gave a pair of equations and wrote:
    ''Discuss the convergence of the sequence x[n]''. What follows is a rather plodding
    (for Turing) investigation of a number of different cases, in steps that he labelled
    A through H. The style of presentation strongly suggests that the problem and
    its solution were being investigated for someone else''s benefit, presumably Bayley''s.
    The second folio presents a diagram summarising some features of the solution.
    In one case, there is oscillation between two values; in another, the value tends
    to a limiting value; and in yet another case, it diverges to infinity.'

  zh: 第一页上密密麻麻地写满了数学内容。它以加下划线的标题“问题”开头。图灵接着给出了一对方程并写道：“讨论序列x[n]的收敛性”。接下来是一个相当单调（对于图灵来说）的调查，涉及到许多不同的情况，他用A到H标记了这些步骤。演示风格强烈暗示着这个问题及其解决方案是为了某个人的利益而进行的，很可能是贝利。第二页呈现了一个概括解决方案某些特征的图表。在某种情况下，两个值之间会发生振荡；在另一种情况下，值会趋向于一个极限值；而在另一种情况下，它会发散至无穷大。
