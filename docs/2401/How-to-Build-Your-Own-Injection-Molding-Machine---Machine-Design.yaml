- en: Heater bands wrap around the injector chamber’s tubed shape, and a silica sleeve
    promotes warmth retention. The design also includes a large fan that circulates
    air from one vent placed on the opposite side of—and slightly above—the fan. That
    design decision distributes air across all the aluminum surfaces to cool them
    quickly.

- en: The silica sleeve around the tube inhibits some of its heat loss but lets the
    component cool slightly. That gives the machine’s temperature controller more
    authority over the tube’s temperature since the design allows heating and cooling
    to occur rapidly. Otherwise, the heater bands would overheat the injection chamber’s
    tube, burning the plastic inside the machine and producing flawed pieces.

- en: The injection chamber’s tube also has springs on the bottom, helping the nozzle
    enter the mold opening with enough force to keep it mated while the injection
    occurs. The creators pointed out that if they design future models with larger
    hydraulic cylinders, they’ll probably also need to increase the spring size to
    maintain the desired contact.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The designers encountered a challenge while figuring out how to keep the injection
    chamber’s tube secure and in the right position without too much heat loss. They
    tackled it by using four round screws positioned around the perimeter of the chamber’s
    pipe, virtually eliminating surface-area contact. This approach made the pipe
    stable during the side-to-side operational movement, and it loses minimal heat
    by conduction to the frame.

- en: The top of the tube mounts onto the machine with steel spacers that reduce the
    heat-transfer contact area. The nozzle threads into the heated tube with tapered
    pipe threads, preventing liquefied plastic from leaking. The creators decided
    against using gaskets. That makes it much easier to replace the nozzle or switch
    it out with a different size.

- en: This injection molding machine also includes a precision-ground shaft that goes
    into the heated chamber’s long hole once the plastic pellets are sufficiently
    heated. It fits tight enough to move all the plastic through the machine and out
    the far end.

    down. The pneumatic cylinders create a 120-PSI pressure and force of more than
    3,000 newtons. However, the second iteration will have 4-in. cylinders, making
    it more forceful.

- en: The machine’s front cover stays in place with four screws. The air system works
    when a compressor’s tube is fed into a through-wall quick connect, moving the
    air into an electrical solenoid. All connections to the solenoid occur via T-adapters.
    The team used elbow brackets to create all links to the pneumatic cylinders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solenoid gets 110 volts of electricity when someone turns the machine’s
    injection button on. The electrical flow allows air to travel through tubes snaking
    around to near the top of the frame. Those tubes push the air to the top of the
    injection cylinder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of the machine’s pneumatic cylinders contains a plunger that functions
    like a syringe. Air forced down from the top pushes on the internal surfaces,
    making the whole shaft and injection ram move downward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, releasing the pressure on the injection button pushes the air through
    the tubes to the cylinders’ bottoms. Then, the air presses on the bottom of the
    syringe plungers, raising the injection ram. The injection ram goes up once someone
    releases the button and serves as a safety feature if the press needs to be stopped
    because something’s blocking the ram.

- en: The machine’s back has a standard, three-prong power cord outlet. The main switch
    is directly above where the cord plugs into the back. The team ground the electrical
    connection to the injection molder’s all-metal frame with a yellow wire and the
    phase is split among four loads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first wire sends power to the main injection button, which connects and
    disconnects the phase before the current is routed back to the solenoid. The next
    wire goes to a junction block that causes the fan to start once someone turns
    on the machine. A third wire goes to the main proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) temperature controller. Finally, a fourth wire connects to a solid-state
    relay, the machine’s main switch electronically activated by the temperature controller.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the controller senses the temperature is not high enough, it opens the solid-state
    relay switch, which channels the current to the heating elements and activates
    them. A K-type thermocouple mounted above the nozzle measures the temperature.

- en: However, the brothers admitted a problem with having only one thermocouple in
    their design. They knew it would be better to spread them throughout the build
    and aimed to do that with their next iteration.

- en: The creators begin by plugging the machine into a 110-volt power supply and
    giving it a couple of minutes to reach the required temperature. The display on
    the front of the device indicates when the temp is correct. The team used acrylonitrile
    butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic, so they knew the right nozzle temperature was
    approximately 220°C.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They plugged the air compressor into the back while waiting for the machine
    to get hot enough. Doing that forced the side cylinders up, putting the injection
    ram in the right position for pressing hot plastic into the mold.

- en: The creators filled the injection tube with plastic, then inserted their mold.
    After pushing the mold upward, they placed a spacer below it to maintain contact
    with the nozzle. However, the creators also suggested elevating the mold on a
    scissor lift, provided both components are small enough to fit under the machine’s
    nozzle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, they pressed the injection button and kept it depressed for a few seconds
    longer than necessary, giving the plastic time to start cooling and hardening.
    Waiting like that prevents the plastic from flowing back out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The machine’s creators were also curious about how much plastic it could hold,
    so they filled the injection tube, extruded all the material out and placed the
    contents on a scale. The results showed the machine contained 27.6 grams—more
    than sufficient for home projects.

    better suited to your needs. In any case, knowing what others have tried when
    building injection molding machines is always helpful.
