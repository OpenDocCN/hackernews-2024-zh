- en: IS china about to unleash another wave of deindustrialisation on the rich world?
    About 1m American manufacturing workers lost their jobs to Chinese competition
    in 1997-2011, as the country integrated into the global trading system and began
    shipping cheap goods overseas. This “China shock” has since been blamed for everything
    from rising deaths among working-class Americans to the election of Donald Trump.
    The rejection of liberal attitudes to trade also explains why politicians embrace
    industrial policy today. Now China’s carmakers are enjoying an astonishing rise.
    That stokes fears of another ruinous shock. In fact, the successes of Chinese
    cars should be celebrated, not feared.

- en: Just five years ago China shipped only a quarter as many cars as Japan, then
    the world’s biggest exporter. This week the Chinese industry claimed to have [exported
    over 5m cars](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/11/western-firms-are-quaking-as-chinas-electric-car-industry-speeds-up)
    in 2023, exceeding the Japanese total. China’s biggest carmaker, BYD, sold 0.5m
    electric vehicles (EVs) in the fourth quarter, leaving Tesla in the dust. Chinese
    EVs are so snazzy, whizzy and—most important—cheap that the constraint on their
    export today is the scarcity of vessels for shipping them. As the world decarbonises,
    demand will rise further. By 2030 China could double its share of the global market,
    to a third, ending the dominance of the West’s national champions, especially
    in Europe.
