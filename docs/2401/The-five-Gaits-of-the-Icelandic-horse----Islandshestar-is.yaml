    breeds five gaits. Horses usually have three: Walk, Trot, and Gallop. In addition
    to those gaits, the Icelandic horse has a smooth and desirable gait Tölt and Flying
    pace. Tölt and Flying pace are the gaits who make the Icelandic horse very special
    and desirable to ride.'

- en: The Vikings who settled in Iceland brought their best horses. Our ancestors
    had noticed that some horses had smoother gaits than others and made sure to get
    offsprings from those horses. The Vikings brought the horses that had that versatility
    to Iceland and since the Icelandic horse has remained pure for centuries the gaits
    have been untacked since they were brought to Iceland. Gene mutation is the reason
    that the Icelandic horse is able to synchronize the right and left sides. This
    ability helps the Icelandic horse to move faster and get more speed like in flying
    pace. When the horses are in the fields they choose different gaits according
    to the speed they are moving at and to help them save energy.

- en: The walk is one of the horse’s natural gaits. It is a slow, four-beat, symmetry
    gait where there are either one or two legs touching the ground. The legs touch
    the ground longer than they glide in the air.

- en: The trot is a natural two-beat gait where the horses move two legs diagonally
    to each other. This gait is faster than the walk and is often used first when
    the horses are being trained. This gait is more rough and bouncy than Tölt but
    it is important to allow the horses to trot since they use this gait to rest,
    especially on rough terrain and when going uphills.

    The horses can gallop at a different speed from slow to fast gallop. On the Icelandic
    horse, the gallop and canter are considered to be one combined gait.

- en: Tölt is a smooth four-beat gait where the horses seem to slides onward effortlessly,
    still, they always have one or two legs on the ground at the same time. When the
    horses are on Tölt they put more weight on the back part then on other gaits.
    The horses can Tölt at a slow to a faster pace and the footfall is the same as
    in walk but of course faster. To show smooth Tölt is the Icelanders often hold
    a full glass when riding Tölt without spilling it.

- en: Flying pace is a two-beat gait where the horses move the front and back leg
    on the same side simultaneously so they glide in the air. The flying is ridden
    for a short period at a fast pace or about 48km/h. It is used for raising and
    for show and is equal to a full speed of gallop.

    some horses, it comes naturally but for others, it takes time and effort to get
    the horse to tölt and to keep the horse Tölting.
