- en: The researchers say LMP is at least 10 times faster than a comparable metal
    additive manufacturing process, and the procedure to heat and melt the metal is
    more efficient than some other methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technique does sacrifice resolution for speed and scale. While it can print
    components that are larger than those typically made with slower additive techniques,
    and at a lower cost, it cannot achieve high resolutions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, parts produced with LMP would be suitable for some applications
    in architecture, construction, and industrial design, where components of larger
    structures often don’t require extremely fine details. It could also be utilized
    effectively for rapid prototyping with recycled or scrap metal.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a recent study, the researchers demonstrated the procedure by printing aluminum
    frames and parts for tables and chairs which were strong enough to withstand postprint
    machining. They showed how components made with LMP could be combined with high-resolution
    processes and additional materials to create functional furniture.

    that has some huge advantages. It has downsides, too. But most of our built world
    — the things around us like tables, chairs, and buildings — doesn’t need extremely
    high resolution. Speed and scale, and also repeatability and energy consumption,
    are all important metrics,” says Skylar Tibbits, associate professor in the Department
    of Architecture and co-director of the Self-Assembly Lab, who is senior author
    of a [paper](https://selfassemblylab.mit.edu/s/ACADIA-23-Proceedings_LMP.pdf)

    a PhD student at ETH Zurich; as well as Kimball Kaiser SM ’22 and Jared Laucks,
    a research scientist and lab co-director. The research was presented at the Association
    for Computer Aided Design in Architecture Conference and recently published in
    the association’s proceedings.

- en: One method for printing with metals that is common in construction and architecture,
    called wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), is able to produce large, low-resolution
    structures, but these can be susceptible to cracking and warping because some
    portions must be remelted during the printing process.
  prefs: []

- en: LMP, on the other hand, keeps the material molten throughout the process, avoiding
    some of the structural issues caused by remelting.

- en: Drawing on the group’s previous work on [rapid liquid printing with rubber](https://www.rapidliquidprint.co/),
    the researchers built a machine that melts aluminum, holds the molten metal, and
    deposits it through a nozzle at high speeds. Large-scale parts can be printed
    in just a few seconds, and then the molten aluminum cools in several minutes.

- en: “Our process rate is really high, but it is also very difficult to control.
    It is more or less like opening a faucet. You have a big volume of material to
    melt, which takes some time, but once you get that to melt, it is just like opening
    a tap. That enables us to print these geometries very quickly,” Karsan explains.

    be recycled cheaply and efficiently.

- en: Bread loaf-sized pieces of aluminum are deposited into an electric furnace,
    “which is basically like a scaled-up toaster,” Karsan adds. Metal coils inside
    the furnace heat the metal to 700 degrees Celsius, slightly above aluminum’s 660-degree
    melting point.

- en: The aluminum is held at a high temperature in a graphite crucible, and then
    molten material is gravity-fed through a ceramic nozzle into a print bed along
    a preset path. They found that the larger the amount of aluminum they could melt,
    the faster the printer can go.

- en: “Molten aluminum will destroy just about everything in its path. We started
    with stainless steel nozzles and then moved to titanium before we ended up with
    ceramic. But even ceramic nozzles can clog because the heating is not always entirely
    uniform in the nozzle tip,” Karsan says.

    don’t need to print supports to hold the aluminum structure as it takes shape.

- en: They experimented with a number of materials to fill the print bed, including
    graphite powders and salt, before selecting 100-micron glass beads. The tiny glass
    beads, which can withstand the extremely high temperature of molten aluminum,
    act as a neutral suspension so the metal can cool quickly.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The glass beads are so fine that they feel like silk in your hand. The powder
    is so small that it doesn’t really change the surface characteristics of the printed
    object,” Tibbits says.

- en: The amount of molten material held in the crucible, the depth of the print bed,
    and the size and shape of the nozzle have the biggest impacts on the geometry
    of the final object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, parts of the object with larger diameters are printed first, since
    the amount of aluminum the nozzle dispenses tapers off as the crucible empties.
    Changing the depth of the nozzle alters the thickness of the metal structure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To aid in the LMP process, the researchers developed a numerical model to estimate
    the amount of material that will be deposited into the print bed at a given time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the nozzle pushes into the glass bead powder, the researchers can’t
    watch the molten aluminum as it is deposited, so they needed a way to simulate
    what should be going on at certain points in the printing process, Tibbits explains.

- en: They used LMP to rapidly produce aluminum frames with variable thicknesses,
    which were durable enough to withstand machining processes like milling and boring.
    They demonstrated a combination of LMP and these post-processing techniques to
    make chairs and a table composed of lower-resolution, rapidly printed aluminum
    parts and other components, like wood pieces.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving forward, the researchers want to keep iterating on the machine so they
    can enable consistent heating in the nozzle to prevent material from sticking,
    and also achieve better control over the flow of molten material. But larger nozzle
    diameters can lead to irregular prints, so there are still technical challenges
    to overcome.

    down recycled aluminum and print parts, that would be a game-changer in metal
    manufacturing. Right now, it is not reliable enough to do that, but that’s the
    goal,” Tibbits says.

    liquid metal printing creating nuanced geometries with the potential for fully
    structural parts was really compelling,” says Jaye Buchbinder, who leads business
    development for the furniture company Emeco and was not involved with this work.
    “The liquid metal printing really walks the line in terms of ability to produce
    metal parts in custom geometries while maintaining quick turnaround that you don’t
    normally get in other printing or forming technologies. There is definitely potential
    for the technology to revolutionize the way metal printing and metal forming are
    currently handled.”
