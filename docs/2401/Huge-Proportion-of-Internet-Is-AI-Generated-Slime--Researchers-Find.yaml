- en: The internet's steady fall into the AI-garbled dumpster continues. As [*Vice*
    reports](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3w4gw/a-shocking-amount-of-the-web-is-already-ai-translated-trash-scientists-determine),
    a [recent stud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05749.pdf)y conducted by researchers
    at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI Lab found that a "shocking amount of the web"
    is already made up of poor-quality AI-generated and translated content.

- en: The paper is yet to be peer-reviewed, but "shocking" feels like the right word.
    According to the study, *over half* — specifically, 57.1 percent — of all of the
    sentences on the internet have been translated into two or more other languages.
    The poor quality and staggering scale of these translations suggest that large
    language model (LLM) -powered AI models were used to both create *and* translate
    the material. The phenomenon is especially prominent in "lower-resource languages,"
    or languages with less readily available data with which to more effectively train
    AI models.

    ad revenue, AI is being used to first generate poor-quality English-language content
    at a remarkable scale, and then AI-powered machine translation (MT) tools transcribe
    said content into several other languages. The translated material gets worse
    each time — and as a result, entire regions of the web are filling to the brim
    with [degrading AI-scrambled copies of copies](https://futurism.com/ai-trained-ai-generated-data-interview).

    amount of translated content on the web in lower-resource languages," the AWS
    researchers write in the paper, "it also constitutes a large fraction of the total
    web content in those languages."'''

    and — [as a new *4o4 Media* report shows](https://www.404media.co/google-news-is-boosting-garbage-ai-generated-articles/)

    in addition to its serious [AI-generated book listings](https://futurism.com/the-byte/amazon-flooded-books-written-by-ai)

    AI creep, this new study suggests that the issue is far more pressing for many
    non-English speakers.

- en: What's worse, the prevalence of AI-spun gibberish might make effectively training
    AI models in lower-resource languages nearly impossible in the long run. To train
    an advanced LLM, AI scientists need large amounts of high-quality data, which
    they generally get by scraping the web. If a given area of the internet is *already*
    overrun by nonsensical AI translations, the possibility of training advanced models
    in rarer languages could be stunted before it even starts.
