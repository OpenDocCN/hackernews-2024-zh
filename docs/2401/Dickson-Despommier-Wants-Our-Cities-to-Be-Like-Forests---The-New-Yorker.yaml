- en: In 2000, Dickson D. Despommier, then a professor of public health and microbiology
    at Columbia University, was teaching a class on medical ecology in which he asked
    his students, “What will the world be like in 2050?,” and a follow-up, “What would
    you *like* the world to be like in 2050?” As Despommier [told](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/09/the-vertical-farm)
    *The New Yorker’s* Ian Frazier in 2017, his students “decided that by 2050 the
    planet will be really crowded, with eight or nine billion people, and they wanted
    New York City to be able to feed its population entirely on crops grown within
    its own geographic limit.” The class had calculated that by farming every square
    foot of rooftop space in the city, you could provide enough calories to feed only
    about two per cent of the 2050 population of New York.

  zh: 2000年，当时是哥伦比亚大学公共卫生与微生物学教授的迪克森·D·德斯庞米尔，在一堂医学生态学课上问他的学生，“2050年的世界会是什么样子？”，以及随后的“你们希望2050年的世界是什么样子？”正如德斯庞米尔2017年告诉《纽约客》的伊恩·弗雷泽所说，他的学生们“决定，到2050年，地球将会非常拥挤，有80亿或90亿人口，他们希望纽约市能够完全依靠在其地理范围内种植的作物来养活其人口。”这堂课计算出，通过在城市的每一平方英尺的屋顶空间种植作物，只能提供足够的热量来养活纽约2050年人口的约2%。
- en: 'Urban farming was a good idea, Despommier thought, but his students hadn’t
    taken it far enough. “What’s wrong with putting the farmer *inside* the building?”
    he asked them, remembering that at the time there were “hundreds to perhaps thousands”
    of empty buildings in New York City. Throughout the next decade, as he continued
    to teach the class, Despommier and his students developed this idea—including
    the use of cultivation techniques that required little or no soil—culminating
    in the 2010 book, “[The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Vertical-Farm-Tenth-Anniversary-Feeding/dp/1250769809/).”
    The concept proved popular and has been widely implemented. There are now more
    than [two thousand vertical farms](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/indoor-vertical-farms-agriculture#:~:text=It''s%20estimated%20there%20are%20more,as%20lettuce%2C%20herbs%20and%20berries.)

  zh: 城市农业是一个好主意，德斯庞米尔认为，但他的学生们没有把它想得够远。“在建筑物*内部*放置农民有什么问题？”他问道，当时纽约市有“数百到可能是数千”座空置建筑。在接下来的十年中，随着他继续授课，德斯庞米尔和他的学生们发展了这个想法，包括使用几乎不需要土壤的栽培技术，最终在2010年出版了《[垂直农场：21世纪的世界粮食供应](https://www.amazon.com/Vertical-Farm-Tenth-Anniversary-Feeding/dp/1250769809/)》一书。这个概念被证明很受欢迎，并得到了广泛实施。仅在美国，已经有超过[两千个垂直农场](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/indoor-vertical-farms-agriculture#:~:text=It's%20estimated%20there%20are%20more,as%20lettuce%2C%20herbs%20and%20berries.)，市场价值在2022年估计为56亿美元。

    ecological problems. His latest book, “[The New City: How to Build Our Sustainable
    Urban Future](https://www.amazon.com/New-City-Build-Sustainable-Future/dp/0231205503/),”
    which evolved from a [course](https://www.fordhamopolis.com/) that Despommier
    taught at Fordham University, is a manifesto for the future of cities on [a warming
    planet](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/global-warming). As Despommier notes, the
    world’s cities make up two per cent of the Earth’s surface but produce sixty per
    cent of the planet’s greenhouse emissions. And cities are likely to continue growing.
    It is estimated that, by the middle of this century, sixty-eight per cent of the
    world’s population will live in urban areas (up from fifty-seven per cent in 2021).'

    have made Despommier’s ideas seem especially urgent. On a recent morning, I spoke

    At eighty-three, he remains a lively, charismatic presence, even onscreen, punctuating

- en: The main reason why deforestation is occurring is to make room for farms. Before
    there was farming, which was about ten to twelve thousand years ago, we had six
    trillion trees. We now have three trillion trees. We’ve cut down half of the Earth’s
    ability to capture carbon. We’re not going to replace all of that with new trees.
    But if we got back up to five trillion trees, let’s say, simply by leaving the
    remaining forests alone and letting them repopulate and selectively harvesting,
    the Earth’s temperature rise would begin to slow down. And, once you’ve slowed
    it down, that gives you time to reflect and to prepare for these changes that
    are not going to go away. Replacing three trillion trees by planting them—that’s
    not going to work. We’ll never be able to do that. So we have to let nature do
    that part. And, in order to do that, we have to return a lot of farmland back
    to what it used to be, which was forests.

  zh: 森林砍伐的主要原因是为了让出耕地。在耕种出现之前，也就是大约一万到一万二千年前，我们有六万亿棵树。现在我们只有三万亿棵树。我们砍掉了地球捕捉碳的一半能力。我们不会用新的树木来取代全部。但如果我们恢复到五万亿棵树，比如说，仅仅是通过让剩下的森林保持原样并让它们自然繁衍，并选择性地收获，地球的温度上升将开始放缓。一旦你放缓了，这就给了你时间去反思和为这些不会消失的变化做准备。通过种树来取代三万亿棵树——这是行不通的。我们永远也做不到。因此，我们必须让自然来做这部分。为了这样做，我们必须把很多耕地变回以前的样子，也就是森林。
- en: '[A scientist] named Gene Likens studied what happens to a forest when you cut
    it down—all of it. You don’t do anything. You leave it all in place and just watch
    it regrow. He started those experiments in the nineteen-sixties in New Hampshire,
    a place called Hubbard Brook. Hubbard Brook has been continuously studied since
    then, for how trees and how a forest recovers from a catastrophic event, like
    clear-cutting. If you look at what happened when Mt. St. Helens blew, it’s almost
    the same thing. The great majority of the trees got knocked down by the shock
    wave from the explosion. If you go online and look at Mt. St. Helens today, you
    wouldn’t recognize it. Actually, you would. It looks like the old Mt. St. Helens!
    So that’s only forty years from a catastrophic event back to a harvestable forest.'

    are still there? Why is that trunk still standing? That’s wood, right? And it
    didn’t burn to the ground. There’s a good reason for that. The trunk is made out
    of very dense-packed lignin and cellulose. Those are the two components of wood.
    The inner core of a tree is not alive. It’s like a coral reef and the tree grows
    out from that core. It’s so dense that the oxygen can’t get to the rest of the
    lignin and the cellulose. Now what if we could make a wood product that had the
