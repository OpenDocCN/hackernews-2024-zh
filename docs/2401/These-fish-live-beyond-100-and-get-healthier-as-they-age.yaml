- en: Now, the new study, [published recently in *Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44328-8)*,*
    confirmed that two more buffalofish species—the smallmouth buffalo and the black
    buffalo—can live more than a hundred years, making it the only known genus of
    animal besides the marine rockfish, *Sebastes, *that has three centenarian species.

    [Greenland sharks have the greatest longevity of any living vertebrate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/greenland-sharks-animals-science-age),
    reaching at least 250 years old.

    lives into their upper 80s and 90s, with better stress response and immune function
    relative to younger individuals. [*(See six of the world’s longest-lived animals.)*](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/flamingo-albatross-longevity-clam)

    says study leader [Alec Lackmann](https://scse.d.umn.edu/faculty-staff/alec-lackmann),
    a fish expert at the University of Minnesota. “They defy expectations.”

- en: For the Arizona study, a few dozen anglers, including Black, caught 222 buffalofish
    at Apache Lake from July 2018 to July 2023\. Twenty three were humanely euthanized
    and donated to the research team, who estimated the fishes’ ages by removing and
    analyzing tiny ear stones called otoliths. These calcium carbonate structures,
    which allow fish to hear and sense vibrations in the water, form a new layer each
    year that can be read somewhat like tree rings.
