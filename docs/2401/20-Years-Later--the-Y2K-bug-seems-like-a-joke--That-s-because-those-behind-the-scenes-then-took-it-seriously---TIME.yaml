- en: In the final hours of Dec. 31, 1999, John Koskinen boarded an airplane bound
    for New York City. He was accompanied by a handful of reporters but few other
    passengers, among them a tuxedo-clad reveler who was troubled to learn that, going
    by the Greenwich Mean Time clock used by airlines, he too would enter the 20th
    century in the air.

    Bill Clinton’s Y2K “czar,” and he flew that night to prove to a jittery public
    — and [scrutinizing press](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4514472/user-clip-john-koskinen-y2k-flying)—
    that after an extensive, multi-year effort, the country was ready for the new
    millennium.

- en: The term Y2K had become shorthand for a problem stemming from the clash of the
    upcoming Year 2000 and the two-digit year format utilized by early coders to minimize
    use of computer memory, then an expensive commodity. If computers interpreted
    the “00” in 2000 as 1900, this could mean headaches ranging from wildly erroneous
    mortgage calculations to, some speculated, large-scale blackouts and infrastructure
    damage.

    understood. “The vast majority of people have absolutely no clue how computers
    work. So when someone comes along and says look we have a problem…[involving]
    a two-digit year rather than a four-digit year, their eyes start to glaze over,”
    says Peter de Jeger, host of the podcast “[Y2K: An Autobiography](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/y2k-an-autobiography/id1455676429).”'

    businesses — spurred by their own testing — responded in kind, racking up an [estimated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/18/077r-111899-idx.html)

    Amid the uncertainty, some Americans stocked up on food, water and guns in anticipation
    of a computer-induced apocalypse. Ominous news reports [warned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/is-the-world-ready-for-y2k/)
    of possible chaos if critical systems failed, but, behind the scenes, those tasked
    with avoiding the problem were — correctly — confident the new year’s beginning
    would not bring disaster.

    it over a decade in advance. And the general public who was busy stocking up on
    supplies and stuff just didn’t have a sense that the programmers were on the job,”
    says Paul Saffo, a futurist and adjunct professor at Stanford University.

    sufficient doubt to hold off on declaring victory prematurely. The former IT director
    of a grocery chain recalls executives’ reticence to publicize their efforts for
    fear of embarrassing headlines about nationwide cash register outages. As Saffo
    notes, “better to be an anonymous success than a public failure.”

    Y2K morphed into a punch line, as relief gave way to derision — as is so often
    the case when warnings appear unnecessary after they are heeded. It was called
    a big hoax; the effort to [fix it a waste of time](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2000-01-12-0001110368-story.html).

    the hardest and spending the most.”

    received scant recognition. (One programmer recalls the reward for a five-year
    project at his company: lunch and a pen.) It was a tedious, unglamorous effort,
    hardly the stuff of heroic narratives — nor conducive to an outpouring of public
    gratitude, even though some of the fixes put in place in 1999 are still used today
    to keep the world’s computer systems running smoothly.'

    but only because they were aware of the steps that had been taken — an awareness

    nobody had done anything,” he says, “I wouldn’t have taken the flight.”
