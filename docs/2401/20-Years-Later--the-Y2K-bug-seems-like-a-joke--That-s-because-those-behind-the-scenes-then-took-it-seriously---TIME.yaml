- en: In the final hours of Dec. 31, 1999, John Koskinen boarded an airplane bound
    for New York City. He was accompanied by a handful of reporters but few other
    passengers, among them a tuxedo-clad reveler who was troubled to learn that, going
    by the Greenwich Mean Time clock used by airlines, he too would enter the 20th
    century in the air.

  zh: 在1999年12月31日的最后几个小时，约翰·科斯基宁（John Koskinen）登上了一架飞往纽约的飞机。他带着几名记者，但其他乘客很少，其中包括一位穿着礼服的狂欢者，他惊讶地发现，按照航空公司使用的格林尼治平均时间时钟，他也将在飞机上进入20世纪。

    Bill Clinton’s Y2K “czar,” and he flew that night to prove to a jittery public
    — and [scrutinizing press](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4514472/user-clip-john-koskinen-y2k-flying)—

- en: The term Y2K had become shorthand for a problem stemming from the clash of the
    upcoming Year 2000 and the two-digit year format utilized by early coders to minimize
    use of computer memory, then an expensive commodity. If computers interpreted
    the “00” in 2000 as 1900, this could mean headaches ranging from wildly erroneous
    mortgage calculations to, some speculated, large-scale blackouts and infrastructure
    damage.

  zh: 术语Y2K已经成为一个问题的简称，这个问题源于即将到来的2000年和早期程序员利用两位数字年份格式来最小化计算机内存使用，当时计算机内存是昂贵的商品。如果计算机将2000年的“00”解释为1900年，这可能意味着从极端错误的抵押计算到一些人猜测的大规模停电和基础设施损坏的头痛。
