- en: Two years after being published, the letsblock.it project is used by hundreds
    of users and ran thanks to [dozens of contributors](https://github.com/letsblockit/letsblockit/?tab=readme-ov-file#thanks-to-our-contributors)
    and [financial sponsors](https://opencollective.com/letsblockit#section-contributors)
    who I am grateful for.

- en: Unfortunately, we are fighting a losing battle in a commercial internet that
    is becoming more user-hostile everyday. I decided to move on and shut it down.
    **This project is making the commercial web more bearable, but I’d rather spend
    my energy on making the non-commercial web more attractive.** I want to support
    communities and applications that respect their users and value what we have to
    say. These websites don’t need letsblock.it rules, because they don’t shove low-quality
    content and anti-features down our throats.
