    makes Tomahawk a P2P streaming client with which you can listen to your friends'
    collections, tap into your work computer's music from your home computer, and
    so on.

    tutorial](http://evolver.fm/2011/03/31/tomahawk-next-generation-music-player-the-beginners-guide/)
    on how to use it, but it still requires a small degree of technical sophistication.
    The main hurdle: installing the content resolvers, which are the plug-ins that
    let Tomahawk hook in to YouTube, Spotify and the rest.'

    and choose the resolvers you want from the list, pictured to the right – or (this
    is easier) just go to Tomahawk > Preferences > Resolvers and install them from
    there. (In the case of Grooveshark, Spotify and any other unlimited music subscriptions,
    you'll need to be a premium subscriber in order for it to work.)

    the same way you can in iTunes. "Extended network" lets you tap into your friends''
    collections on their computers, so that if you don''t have a song on a given playlist,
    it plays from their machine. (They need to be running Tomahawk at the time.)'

    in real time with your friends and make radio stations that resolve to any sources
    to which you have access. (The latter uses technology from [The Echo Nest](http://the.echonest.com),
    [publisher](http://evolver.fm/about/) of Evolver.fm.) It also includes nice extras
    like the ability to choose only [high-quality music from YouTube](http://evolver.fm/2011/02/08/how-to-get-better-sound-on-youtube/).

    goodness of our hearts and a passion to solve this problem: All of the media players
    that have been around for 10 years were built to solve problems of 10 years ago.
    We don''t need [CD-R] label-makers, we don''t need to print CD cases, we don''t
    need to worry about a lot of things that old players like Winamp, which I worked
    on back in the day, has to worry about.'
