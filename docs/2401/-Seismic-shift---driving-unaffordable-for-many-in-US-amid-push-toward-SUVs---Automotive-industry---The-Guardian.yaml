- en: At the start of the pandemic, Ceola Luna, a 45-year-old Lyft driver in Los Angeles,
    bought a 2005 Saturn Vue crossover, after her new Dodge Caravan (a minivan) was
    wrecked in a crash. The Vue wasn’t nearly as nice, but it was affordable at $4,000
    – including rust, engine issues and a dashboard full of warning lights.

    lifeline for Luna. But much of what she made ended up going to car mechanics as
    the small SUV kept breaking down. Then last year, Lyft informed Luna that her
    Vue had gotten too old for the platform, leaving her jobless. So she scrambled
    to find a new gig as a care worker for autistic children, and then the car failed
    again. To save up for another mechanic appointment, Luna has been taking the bus
    to her clients – sapping her earnings with hours of unpaid commute time.

    for rent. But even if Luna had the funds to go shopping, it’s unlikely she would
    find anything remotely reasonable. The average new car today sells for nearly
    $49,000, and the average used car lists at more than $26,000 – representing a
    31% increase for new cars and nearly 40% increase for used cars since 2020, according
    to [data](https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights/#snapshot) from the industry group
    Cox Automotive.

    the pandemic. So why are consumers still getting squeezed?

    an industry-wide production cut, the pandemic gave manufacturers power to demand
    mind-boggling prices for fewer cars, leading to record profits. As consumers adjusted
    their expectations, executives saw an opportunity to establish a lucrative new
    normal. Low inventory is an “opportunity to drive strong margins”, GM’s CEO, [Mary
    Barra, told shareholders](https://thehill.com/business/3796818-new-cars-are-for-richer-people-how-the-auto-industry-capitalized-on-pandemic/)
    in 2022\. Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, went even further, declaring: “I want to make
    it extremely clear to everyone: we are going to run our business with a lower
    day supply than we have had in the recent past because that’s good for our company.”'

- en: Brian Moody, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, a car industry publication,
    says automakers used the pandemic to shift product lines toward higher-margin
    products. Instead of small cars and base models, they pivoted to luxury cars and
    SUVs with fully loaded trims, which turn far greater profits per sale. That means
    “the less expensive the car, the fewer choices you have”, says Moody. Some commentators
    have called the trend “[trimflation](https://www.theautopian.com/trimflation-explaining-why-automakers-raised-prices-so-much-in-the-pandemic/)”.
    A 2023 Cox Automotive [report](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/seismic-shift-the-u-s-new-vehicle-market-is-becoming-a-luxury-market/)
    declared that “the US new vehicle market is becoming a luxury market”, a “seismic
    shift” that, for many buyers, is “about as enjoyable as a sharp stick in the eye”.

    Like Ben Valdez, who supplements his $60,000 salary as a computer tech at a California
    community college by driving for Uber in an older-generation Toyota Prius with
    280,000 miles. Because Uber deems drivers independent contractors, Valdez is on
    the hook for all maintenance costs, which have ballooned: “Three years ago, I
    was probably paying as little as $50 for an oil change. Now I’m looking at no
    less than $100, and I’ve seen it as high as $150 for just four quarts of synthetic
    oil.” The cost of car tires has gone up by more than half. Even the price of a
    car wash, something Valdez needs to do regularly to keep passengers happy, has
    gone from about $25 to nearly $45, he says.'

    from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average cost of car insurance
    rose more than 14% between the end of 2021 and 2022, before soaring another 20%
    by the end of 2023, the largest one-year increase since the 1970s.

- en: Divya Sangameshwar, an insurance expert at Value Penguin, says those rapid increases
    have several causes. One is that the rising cost of vehicles and maintenance means
    insurers have to pay out more when things go wrong. Another is that more vehicles
    are getting ravaged by the climate crisis. The vehicle data company Carfax estimates
    that Hurricane Ian destroyed as many as 358,000 cars as the storm tore through
    Florida and the Carolinas in 2022\. The climate crisis, in turn, is only being
    exacerbated by the [trend toward massive vehicles](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/22/the-guardian-view-on-suvs-the-trend-towards-vast-cars-needs-to-be-reversed).
    Unless action is taken to reverse climate change, Sangameshwar says, “it is undeniable
    that it will continue to have an impact on auto insurance premiums for the next
    100 years”.

    insurance premiums relatively flat for years, leading to “pent-up pressure” among
    some insurance companies, which “were threatening to walk out of markets where
    they weren’t profitable any more”, Sangameshwar says. But now that states have
    relented, insurers are doing splendidly. Companies like Progressive and Travelers
    reported [record-breaking profits](https://www.wsj.com/finance/insurance-companies-profits-stock-ebae7fd1?st=5rf7q520tlj76oa&reflink=article_copyURL_share)

    difficult odds in this country. Across the United States, transit riderships remain
    much lower than pre-pandemic numbers, and with Covid-era federal grants due to
    expire this year, many transit authorities are planning service cuts, sparking
    fears of a “[death spiral](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1212879398/public-transit-ridership-down-covid-pandemic-death-spiral)”.

    affordable for people who need them – a proposal he calls “[universal auto access](https://transfersmagazine.org/magazine-article/issue-11/the-necessity-of-cars/)”.
    The planner envisions government subsidies for lower-income people to buy or maintain
    cars, paired with new incentives and regulations to steer manufacturers back toward
    smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This car-positive proposal doesn’t
    make him popular among planning circles, King concedes. But “it’s a realist approach:
    this is the world that we have, and we can still work for a better world while
    not leaving some people out of it.”'
