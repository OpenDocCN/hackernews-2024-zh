    Cofield had seen before.

- en: Its fitted bodice, puffy bustle and lace cuffs reflected a bygone era. As a
    vintage costume collector, Rivers Cofield recognized it as a dress from the 1880s
    — but despite its age, its delicate embroidery, bronze silk and metallic buttons
    appeared intact.

    the two-piece garment. The price was higher than she usually pays as an archaeologist
    who collects antique costumes and purses for fun. But it was the holiday season,
    so she splurged.

    mean, and why did Bennett need a “super secret hidey-hole,” in Rivers Cofield’s
    words, to stash them? The buttons alone portrayed a forlorn Ophelia from Shakespeare’s
    “Hamlet,” and were worth more than she’d paid for the dress, she said.

    She has studied 1880s catalogues from department store chain Bloomingdale’s, and
    had no doubt the dress was from that era. By then, the war had been over for about 20
    years.

    new way of sending quick notes launched in the United States in the 1800s, which

    including the weather codes used in North America at the time. And early last
    year, he had a breakthrough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He discovered the coded messages were in fact, a weather report. And they were
    not encrypted for secrecy but because the code allowed forecasters to shorten
    detailed weather reports into a few words, Chan said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the era of the telegraph, such shorthand was cheaper than sending a big batch
    of words and temperature readings. Each word represented meteorological variables
    such as temperature, wind speed and barometric pressure at a specific location
    and time of day.

    specific details](https://www.noaa.gov/heritage/stories/cryptogram-in-silk-dress-tells-weather-story). “Bismark”
    meant it was recorded at Bismarck station in what is now North Dakota. **“**Omit”
    meant the air temperature was 56 degrees and the barometric pressure was 0.08
    inches of mercury. “Leafage” referred to a dew point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit
    observed at 10 p.m. “Buck” indicated there was no precipitation, while “bank”
    meant a wind velocity of 12 mph and a clear sunset.

    cod](https://canwin-datahub.ad.umanitoba.ca/data/publication/breaking-silk-dress-cryptogram)e
    used by the Army Signal Corps, which was the national weather service for the
    US during the late 1800s. For example, a phrase like the “The crew are all drunk”
    would be shortened with a codeword such as “crimping,” he noted

- en: '“This particular code was not meant for secrecy at all. Telegraphic codes were
    used for two main reasons: secrecy and economy,” Chan told CNN. “The weather code
    was for the latter. Because you were charged by the word in a telegram, they wanted
    to shorten or compress a weather report into as few words as possible to save
    on costs.”'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that meteorologists consulted to understand the meaning behind unfamiliar words.
    And with time, they learned the codewords without the need to consult the codebook,
    he said.
