    mean, and why did Bennett need a “super secret hidey-hole,” in Rivers Cofield’s

    not encrypted for secrecy but because the code allowed forecasters to shorten
    detailed weather reports into a few words, Chan said.

  zh: 他发现，这些编码的消息实际上是一份天气报告。Chan 说，这些编码并不是为了保密而加密，而是因为这种编码方法允许预报员将详细的天气报告缩短为几个词。
- en: In the era of the telegraph, such shorthand was cheaper than sending a big batch
    of words and temperature readings. Each word represented meteorological variables
    such as temperature, wind speed and barometric pressure at a specific location
    and time of day.

    meant it was recorded at Bismarck station in what is now North Dakota. **“**Omit”
    meant the air temperature was 56 degrees and the barometric pressure was 0.08
    inches of mercury. “Leafage” referred to a dew point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit

    cod](https://canwin-datahub.ad.umanitoba.ca/data/publication/breaking-silk-dress-cryptogram)e
    used by the Army Signal Corps, which was the national weather service for the
    US during the late 1800s. For example, a phrase like the “The crew are all drunk”
    would be shortened with a codeword such as “crimping,” he noted

  zh: Chan 发现，编码信息使用了19世纪陆军信号部使用的一种电报天气代码，该部门是19世纪末美国的国家气象服务。例如，像“船员都喝醉了”这样的短语将被缩短为“crimping”等代码词，他指出。
- en: '“This particular code was not meant for secrecy at all. Telegraphic codes were
    used for two main reasons: secrecy and economy,” Chan told CNN. “The weather code
    was for the latter. Because you were charged by the word in a telegram, they wanted
    to shorten or compress a weather report into as few words as possible to save
    on costs.”'

  zh: “这种特殊的代码根本不是为了保密。电报代码主要用于两个原因：保密和经济，”Chan告诉CNN。“天气代码是为了后者。因为你在电报中按字数收费，他们想要尽可能地缩短或压缩天气报告，以节省成本。”
- en: Chan said he’s not sure how the words were picked. There was a weather codebook
    that meteorologists consulted to understand the meaning behind unfamiliar words.
    And with time, they learned the codewords without the need to consult the codebook,
    he said.

    specific numerical values,” Chan said. “It was really a very complex code, even
    though the intent was not for secrecy.”
