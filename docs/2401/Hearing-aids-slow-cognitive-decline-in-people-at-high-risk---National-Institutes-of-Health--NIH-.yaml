- en: Studies have found an association between hearing loss and the development of
    dementia in older adults. Research also suggests that using hearing aids to treat
    hearing loss may help slow the development of cognitive problems. But potential
    links between hearing loss treatment and improved cognition hadn’t been tested
    in a large, randomized study.

  zh: 研究发现老年人听力损失与痴呆症的发展存在关联。研究还表明，使用听力辅助设备治疗听力损失可能有助于减缓认知问题的发展。但听力损失治疗与改善认知之间的潜在联系尚未在大规模随机研究中得到验证。
- en: To close this gap, an NIH-funded research team co-led by Dr. Frank Lin from
    Johns Hopkins University enrolled nearly 1,000 adults, ages 70 to 84, into a clinical
    trial. They compared the rate of cognitive decline over a three-year period between
    people who did and didn’t receive hearing aids.

  zh: 为了填补这一空白，由约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的弗兰克·林博士共同领导的一个NIH资助的研究团队，将近1000名70至84岁的成年人纳入了临床试验。他们比较了那些使用和未使用听力辅助设备的人群在三年内认知衰退率的差异。
- en: The researchers recruited participants with substantial hearing loss from two
    different study populations. About 250 healthy older adults came from a long-term
    study of heart health at four sites in the U.S. Another 739 people were newly
    recruited from the surrounding communities at the same four sites. Participants
    recruited from the heart-health study had more risk factors for developing dementia,
    including being older and having faster rates of cognitive decline than those
    from the general community.

- en: The researchers randomly assigned participants to one of two interventions.
    About half received hearing aids and instruction in how to use them. The other
    half were assigned to a health education program focused on promoting healthy
    aging. Both groups received follow-up visits every six months to reinforce the

    abilities over the course of the study. Those in the health-education group, as

    had a higher risk of dementia, the benefit of the hearing aids was substantial.
    Those who received hearing aids had an almost 50% reduction in the rate of cognitive
    decline compared with people in the health-education group.
