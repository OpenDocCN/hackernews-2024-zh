    dig in!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I feel very unambiguous about this. React is bad software.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea *behind* React is pretty neat. Update some data, and have the UI *react*
    to it automatically. But React isn’t the only tool to do that, and they didn’t
    originate the idea, either. They just helped popularize it.

    people who use it and the developers who have to work on an maintain it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React is comically, absurdly big. [It’s slow](https://gomakethings.com/react-is-still-absolutely-terrible-for-web-performance/)
    ([at it’s very core](https://gomakethings.com/react-is-slow-at-its-very-core/),
    and won’t ever not be). Rendering HTML with JavaScript means your very resilient
    HTML is now super fragile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of this is terrible for users. But React is also horrible for your developer
    team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React requires a build step, and that build step is often centered around Webpack.
    Webpack is very powerful, but also very complicated, and a bit rigid in what it
    can and can’t do.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’re in the React ecosystem, you’re incentivized to use it for more and
    more stuff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That means your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all end up getting rendered with JavaScript.
    This is, again, terrible for your users. But it also means that the only developers
    who can work on your site have to specialize in JavaScript, and often don’t know
    as much about HTML and CSS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This results in sites that, frankly, have terrible HTML and CSS, that actively
    harms end users, is often inaccessible, and becomes increasingly hard to maintain
    over time.

    site.

    on user interactions, it should be served as static HTML files from the server.

    rendering.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Components are the best way to handle that](https://gomakethings.com/the-elevator-pitch-for-web-components/)
    in 2024, but there are other valid approaches as well.

    rendering, and how to choose which approach to use.
