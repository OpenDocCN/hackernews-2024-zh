    to it automatically. But React isn’t the only tool to do that, and they didn’t
    originate the idea, either. They just helped popularize it.

    people who use it and the developers who have to work on an maintain it.

    ([at it’s very core](https://gomakethings.com/react-is-slow-at-its-very-core/),
    and won’t ever not be). Rendering HTML with JavaScript means your very resilient
    HTML is now super fragile.

    Webpack is very powerful, but also very complicated, and a bit rigid in what it
    can and can’t do.

    This is, again, terrible for your users. But it also means that the only developers
    who can work on your site have to specialize in JavaScript, and often don’t know
    as much about HTML and CSS.

    harms end users, is often inaccessible, and becomes increasingly hard to maintain
