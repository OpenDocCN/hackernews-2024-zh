- en: Outside the National Gallery in London sits the strangest statue in Trafalgar
    Square, or maybe all of England. It's not bizarre because of its design or composition,
    but instead for whom the statue honors.

    only in London, considering who it is and where the statue is placed.

- en: It's a statue of George Washington, onetime citizen of Great Britain, father
    of the United States and rebellious colonial. In a square that marks one of Britain's
    greatest victories stands a reminder of one of its greatest defeats.

    authority, like the 13 wooden rods on which he leans (also a symbol of the 13
    colonies). It's just hanging out in a square owned by the crown -- and built on
    soil shipped in from the state of Virginia.

- en: The statue was presented to the British as a gift in 1921, when relations between
    the United States and the United Kingdom were much, much better than they had
    been in 1783\. It's an exact replica of an original statue commissioned by Thomas
    Jefferson, which can still be seen in the Virginia State Capitol building in Richmond.

    from the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., to Lima, Peru and, of course,
    London's Trafalgar Square.

- en: Because legend has it that George Washington once swore he would never set foot
    on British soil ever again, the erectors of the Trafalgar Square statue laid it
    on a foundation of Virginia soil to ensure that Washington did not tell a lie.

    unwelcome in London is the real fiction. Washington was actually well-respected
    by the British people -- and by one very important British person in particular.

    III himself, whose land forces Washington spent seven years evading and killing,
    came to admire and respect the American leader.

    Washington, the head of the Continental Army, ceded his power and resigned rather
    than take the country by force. The king called Washington "the greatest man of
    the age."

    was hung in the East Room of the White House at the end of John Adams' presidency,
    where it remains today. The original is owned by the U.S. National Portrait Gallery.
