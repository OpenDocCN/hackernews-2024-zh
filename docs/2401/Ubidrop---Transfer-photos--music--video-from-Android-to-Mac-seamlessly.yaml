- en: Cloud storage providers need to hold a copy of your data in order to have them
    available to other devices. This alone makes them really appealing targets to
    hackers, due to the amount of personal information they hold.

- en: Your data also needs to travel from one device, to a far away server and then
    back to the device you would like to access the file. This, other than more security
    risk, sounds like an overkill.
