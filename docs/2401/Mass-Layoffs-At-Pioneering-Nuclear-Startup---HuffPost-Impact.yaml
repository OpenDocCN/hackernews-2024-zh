    as European democracies scrambled to find alternatives to buying natural gas from
    Moscow. The constant need to replenish pipelines using a fuel with a wildly fluctuating
    price put a new premium on nuclear energy’s steady 24-hour output without needing
    refueling for two years or more. To boot, nuclear reactors don’t produce planet-heating
    emissions, and they generate orders of magnitude more electricity, more frequently
    and on less land, than solar panels or wind turbines.
