- en: 'From an early age, Flaubert preferred the beautiful vistas he discovered in
    books, and yet he could never avoid the most awful truths of human existence:
    disease, disintegration, illness, and death. He felt both a cynical distrust of
    bourgeois fantasies—that individuals could, through education and hard work, rise
    above the animal limitations of their bodies—and a deep abiding sympathy for those
    human beings foolish enough to believe them.'

- en: His parents wanted Flaubert to pursue everything about bourgeois professional
    life that he despised; and it is perhaps only because of several illnesses and
    tragedies that Flaubert escaped the fate they mapped out for him. In the midst
    of his miserable adventures as a law student in Paris (“What a marvelous idea
    it was of somebody’s to invent the Law School for the express purpose of boring
    the shit out of us!”), he began suffering a series of epileptic seizures that
    sent him home for weeks at a time; he was afflicted with huge painful boils on
    his neck and body, bad teeth, gout, and very probably syphilis; then, over a miserable
    couple of years, those closest to him began dying—first his father, then his beloved
    sister, and finally the dearest friend of his youth, Alfred Le Poittevin. Without
    these misfortunes and ailments, he might never have cultivated his solitary nature.
    As he wrote Le Poittevin in May 1845, “The only way not to be unhappy is to shut
    yourself up in Art and count all the rest as nothing.”

- en: I have said an irrevocable farewell to the practical life. My nervous illness
    was the transition between two states. From now until a day that is far distant
    I ask for no more than five or six quiet hours in my room, a good fire in winter,
    and a pair of candles to light me at night.

- en: 'By shutting himself up with “Art” (a word he always capitalized), he could
    just as firmly shut his door on the world. “I hate life,” he wrote to another
    youthful friend, Maxime Du Camp. “There: I have said it; I’ll not take it back.
    Yes, life; and everything that reminds me that life must be borne. It bores me
    to eat, to dress, to stand on my feet, etc. I have dragged this hatred everywhere,
    wherever I have been: at school, in Rouen, in Paris, on the Nile.” The world’s
    temptations stopped being so tempting as Flaubert grew older. Partly it was his
    faulty body falling apart. But in reading his letters, it is clear that much of
    the passion was simply knocked clean out of him.'
