- en: 'From an early age, Flaubert preferred the beautiful vistas he discovered in
    books, and yet he could never avoid the most awful truths of human existence:
    disease, disintegration, illness, and death. He felt both a cynical distrust of
    bourgeois fantasies—that individuals could, through education and hard work, rise
    above the animal limitations of their bodies—and a deep abiding sympathy for those
    human beings foolish enough to believe them.'

  zh: 从小，弗洛伊贝尔更喜欢在书中发现的美丽景色，然而他却无法逃避人类存在的最可怕的真相：疾病、分解、疾病和死亡。他对资产阶级幻想的愤世嫉俗——即个体可以通过教育和努力工作超越身体的动物局限——既怀有深深的不信任，又怀有对那些愚蠢到相信这些幻想的人的深刻同情。
- en: His parents wanted Flaubert to pursue everything about bourgeois professional
    life that he despised; and it is perhaps only because of several illnesses and
    tragedies that Flaubert escaped the fate they mapped out for him. In the midst
    of his miserable adventures as a law student in Paris (“What a marvelous idea
    it was of somebody’s to invent the Law School for the express purpose of boring
    the shit out of us!”), he began suffering a series of epileptic seizures that
    sent him home for weeks at a time; he was afflicted with huge painful boils on
    his neck and body, bad teeth, gout, and very probably syphilis; then, over a miserable
    couple of years, those closest to him began dying—first his father, then his beloved
    sister, and finally the dearest friend of his youth, Alfred Le Poittevin. Without
    these misfortunes and ailments, he might never have cultivated his solitary nature.
    As he wrote Le Poittevin in May 1845, “The only way not to be unhappy is to shut
    yourself up in Art and count all the rest as nothing.”

  zh: 他的父母希望弗洛伊贝尔追求他所鄙视的资产阶级职业生活的一切；也许只有因为几次疾病和悲剧，弗洛伊贝尔才得以摆脱他们为他规划的命运。在巴黎作为一名法律学生的悲惨经历中（“有人发明法学院的绝妙主意，目的就是让我们无聊透顶！”），他开始遭受一连串癫痫发作，使他连续几周都呆在家里；他颈部和身体上长了大而痛苦的疖子，牙痛，痛风，很可能还有梅毒；然后，在几年的悲惨岁月中，他最亲近的人开始相继去世
    —— 首先是他的父亲，然后是他心爱的妹妹，最后是他青年时代最亲爱的朋友阿尔弗雷德·勒普瓦当。如果没有这些不幸和疾病，他可能永远也不会培养出自己的孤独性格。正如他在1845年5月写给勒普瓦当的信中所说，“不让自己不幸的唯一方法就是将自己困在艺术中，将其他一切视为无足轻重。”
- en: I have said an irrevocable farewell to the practical life. My nervous illness
    was the transition between two states. From now until a day that is far distant
    I ask for no more than five or six quiet hours in my room, a good fire in winter,
    and a pair of candles to light me at night.

  zh: 我已经对实际生活说了不可撤销的告别。我的神经病是两个状态之间的过渡。从现在起直到一个遥远的日子，我只请求在我的房间里静静地度过五六个小时，冬天有好的火，晚上有一双蜡烛照亮我。
- en: 'By shutting himself up with “Art” (a word he always capitalized), he could
    just as firmly shut his door on the world. “I hate life,” he wrote to another
    youthful friend, Maxime Du Camp. “There: I have said it; I’ll not take it back.
    Yes, life; and everything that reminds me that life must be borne. It bores me
    to eat, to dress, to stand on my feet, etc. I have dragged this hatred everywhere,
    wherever I have been: at school, in Rouen, in Paris, on the Nile.” The world’s
    temptations stopped being so tempting as Flaubert grew older. Partly it was his
    faulty body falling apart. But in reading his letters, it is clear that much of
    the passion was simply knocked clean out of him.'

  zh: 通过与“艺术”（他总是大写这个词）为伴，他就能将自己紧紧地关在世界之外。“我讨厌生活，”他写给另一个年轻的朋友马克西姆·杜坎普。“我说了：我不会收回。是的，生活，以及提醒我生活必须被忍受的一切。吃饭、穿衣、站立，等等，这些都让我厌烦。我已经将这种厌恶带到了任何地方，无论我在哪里：在学校里，在鲁昂，在巴黎，在尼罗河上。”随着弗洛伊贝尔年岁的增长，世界的诱惑变得不再诱人。部分原因是他不堪一击的身体开始崩溃。但在阅读他的信件时，很明显，很多的激情只是被他清理得干干净净了。
