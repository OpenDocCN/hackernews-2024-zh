    by technical features. We talk about things having been done on a branch or existing
    on a branch, or what branches are what on an intertwined tree of them, even when
    this is not something you can find in the Git repository.'

    a user interface to their underlying mathematics](/~cks/space/blog/tech/VCSUINotMathematics).
    Git has an internal, mathematical view of what 'branches' are, but very few people
    actually use this mathematical view; instead we use a variety of 'user interface'
    views of what branches are and how we think of them. Git supports these user views
    of branches with various 'porcelain' features.

- en: Some projects using Git actively work to create branches that have a more concrete
    and durable existence. For instance, [commits on a Go release branch have the
    branch name in the commit's title](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+log/refs/heads/release-branch.go1.21),
    which is something the Go project does for a lot of branches that are used in
    Go development and release. For development branches specifically, this durably
    marks commits as having been done on the branch even after the branch is merged
    to the 'main' development branch.

- en: Certainly, how I normally think of Git branches is different from their technical
    existence, and it differs from branch to branch. For example, in a typical repository
    I think of the 'main' branch as running all the way back to the creation of the
    repository, but other branches as only running back to where they split from 'main',
    despite this not being technically correct.

    VCS history. These VCSes are neither wrong nor right; my view is that they''ve
    taken a different view of both the UI and the mathematics of what ''branches''
    are in their mathematical version of version control.'
