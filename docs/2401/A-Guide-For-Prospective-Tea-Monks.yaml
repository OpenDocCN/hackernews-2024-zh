    to listen to their thoughts and troubles? Imagine how much good might come from
    such a simple exchange of tea and sympathy. If only this service had been offered
    when you needed it, when you were feeling a little lonely, or maybe even just
    wanting to share a positive human moment, just to know that there was someone

    village to city, set up their kettle and teapot, and pick the ideal tea blends
    for bringing warmth and comfort to anyone who stops to spend time with them. Becky
    Chamber's Monk & Robot series of novellas tells of the journey of one such monk,
    Sibling Dex, who suddenly one day feels called to this pursuit, and how they discover
    themselves in the process, especially when they encounter an intelligence unlike
    any they've met before, which is also seeking for greater understanding.

    and church social events. It is providing company and refreshment to people outside
    in public squares, parks, and along busy thoroughfares. This is someone freely
    sharing their time and tea, and relying on the good will of those around them
    to get by. It is an idea that could work on Earth in reality, with some adjustments,
    just as it does on the fictional Panga.

    for such a service on this planet, perhaps there has been some contact between
    Panga and Earth that inspired it, or maybe someone like me just read Chamber's
    story, and thought, ‘that sounds like a good idea, I wonder how that might work
    here?’ This is intended to look into that possibility, and what it would take
    on our world.

    plenty of times, as everyone did, and they’d read plenty of books about the particulars
    of the practice. Endless electronic ink had been spilled over the old tradition,

    noble cause. Various religious traditions have some form of monasticism, sometimes
    in which its members shut themselves away from the world and spend their lives
    in quiet contemplation, but in other traditions they might occupy their days in
    acts of service, and even travel to different places, wherever they are needed.

    go where they want to, enjoy the comforts available to them, and are free to form
    relationships as they wish. When they arrive at a new place and have made camp
    they begin a new day by setting up their equipment and chairs, and making themselves
    available for any who might wish to stop and spend time with them.

    This service isn't limited to just tea, and their mission is not to convert, but
    to comfort, uplift, and aid others. However, they aren't required to serve anyone
    or do anything they don't feel comfortable doing either, as the discernment of
    who and where they help is left up to them.

    offering to listen can be a very valuable one, and is something you don't need
    any qualifications to do. You can always recommend further help if someone else

    time with them) through moving for education, a job or a relationship. Others
    have family and friends they are close to in some areas but have parts of themselves

    the chance to share or ask about something we aren't sure about, without judgement,

    strong?’ ‘Rich Tea or digestive?’ (Or any number of the many biscuits designed

- en: Remember that people have practical needs too, although these often can be connected
    to emotional ones, and sometimes the best way to free someone from their worries
    is to address the practical solvable thing that is worrying them. But you have
    to be careful, because many things are not changeable and most things (especially
    people) are beyond your control, and people often need the emotional side addressed
    first, but may be too proud to accept help.

    any area where you have a skill or talent to share, can make a tremendous difference
    in someone's life and toward their emotional health. Even where there isn't a
    related emotional challenge, the solidarity and comradeship of helping someone
    practically can be a very positive contribution to their life.

    in many ways, for example by helping out at food pantries or pay what you want
    at cafes etc. (they may be able to give you a pot to perform your Tea Service
    too), or helping out with local charities and refuges. If you are at a loss as
    to what you can do you may want to seek out your local Anarchists, if you want
    to find a secular group involved in this, or contact local socially-liberal churches
    that may run such programmes.

    to this person's well being?’, ‘am I respecting their choices and dignity while
    supporting them?’, ‘am I helping the community?’, or ‘am i just cheap labour?’
    (which may be good if you need the money, and could give you an opportunity to
    get to know locals and speak to them, but might divert you from your purpose if
    it becomes the main focus).

    in an emergency, if you are strong you can carry heavy stuff, if you understand
    a topic very well you might find chances to share what you know. But if you don't
    think you have any skills or talents you will probably find some you didn't know
    you had along the way, and if you don't have what a person needs practically (like
    money or food), you can still always offer any sympathy, empathy or understanding
    if have been through something similar, and tea and company if you haven't.

    foodstuffs, but tea is especially suited and associated for relaxing and sharing,
    if you have the extra room you could always carry some free books to lend or give,
    or some more practical items to give away.

    you may want to make a distinction between your role as a Tea Monk and your personal
    views and actions. Having said this, just giving tea away may be seen as a political
    act by some, or as a service which economically undermines other systems, so escaping
    from such judgements (from the particularly judgemental) may be unavoidable.

    you could track where Tea Monks were in the world, and a forum for them to support
    and encourage each other. The training materials would definitely need to get
    better than this short guide, and maybe seasoned Tea Monks could offer apprenticeships,
    or there could be an opportunity for sponsorships. Maybe pop up or even permanent
    tea parlours might be created in bigger cities where people could drop in. But
    I'd like to envision a future world where all tea will ultimately be free, followed
    by free food, and then free housing too, and in which kindness was the currency
    instead of money.
