    Sheck Wes’ “Mo Bamba.” The commonalities these artists and songs share is neither
    region nor genre but platform. [SoundCloud](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/soundclouds-new-venture-mixes-social-network-music-service/)
    was their origin point. “It sparked so many careers once upon a time,” says [Stonie
    Blue](https://soundcloud.com/antbluejr), a New York-based DJ and cofounder of
    [BIYDIY Records](http://www.biydiy.online/). “Artists could upload their music
    straight to the community that would lurk there before the main focus was streaming
    on [Apple Music](https://www.wired.com/tag/apple-music/) or [Spotify](https://www.wired.com/tag/spotify/).”
    Blue joined the platform in 2012, and in that time, he's come across newbie artists
    like Sango, Dream Koala, Yeek, and WOLFE de MÇHLS. “SoundCloud,” he says, “always
    felt like the underground.”

    That''s been the case since it launched in 2007\. The Berlin-founded company has
    maintained its relevance by embracing a simple ethos: come as you are. That’s
    made SoundCloud the for-everybody platform—one that embraces all genres, sexualities,
    religions, and definitions of music and art. By setting itself up as a hub for
    community-oriented music streaming, it’s become a kind of incubator for avant-garde
    sounds. Today, SoundCloud is everybody’s underground.'

- en: That may soon change. The company has plans to [pursue a buyer](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/soundcloud-preparing-to-sell-1235578246/https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/soundcloud-preparing-to-sell-1235578246/)
    this year, according to [multiple reports](https://news.sky.com/story/music-streaming-service-soundcloud-tunes-up-for-sale-13043602),
    a move the company has been working on for some time. In 2017, SoundCloud nearly
    shut down when it was reported that the company would run out of funding within
    two months. Thanks to a last-minute $170 million cash infusion from investment
    firms Raine Group and Temasek Holdings, and [a little help](https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud.html)
    from Chance the Rapper, the company was saved from termination. Raine Group and
    Temasek are now reportedly seeking a payday of upwards of $1 billion. With news
    of a possible sale, what hangs in the balance is the possible loss of what has
    made SoundCloud such a unique platform, and the impact that rupture could have
    on the future of the music business.

    producer known as [IAMNOBODI](https://soundcloud.com/iamnobodi). “Wouldn’t be
    where I am today if it wasn’t for SoundCloud. I was able to make a name for myself
    by uploading songs and DJ mixes that people all over the world connected with.
    I became a part of [music collective] Soulection through this platform.”

    SoundCloud，我今天可能不会在这里。通过上传歌曲和 DJ 混音，我能够让全世界的人都认识我。我通过这个平台成为了 [音乐集体] Soulection
    的一员。”
- en: The spirit of the platform was inherent from the beginning. Ademabua, who has
    worked with Nipsey Hussle, Little Simz, and Bryson Tiller, says community was
    always at its heart, and what it stood for. “If anything, SoundCloud was about
    having fun and connecting with like-minded individuals globally,” Ademabua says.

  zh: 这个平台的精神从一开始就是固有的。曾与尼普赛·赫塞尔（Nipsey Hussle）、小辛姆兹（Little Simz）和布莱森·提勒（Bryson Tiller）合作过的阿德马布说，社区一直是它的核心所在，也是它的立足之本。“如果有什么的话，SoundCloud
    就是关于玩乐和与全球志同道合的人建立联系，”阿德马布说。
- en: Those connections hit a critical mass in 2015 when SoundCloud rap announced
    itself to mainstream ears, as upstarts Lil Peep, Smokepurpp, XXXtentacion, and
    Juice WRLD began to make noise. Even for SoundCloud, a platform notorious for
    its exhaustive catalog of sounds, SoundCloud rap—rebellious, drug-friendly, and
    swirling with tales of emo torment—was like nothing else on the scene. *The New
    York Times* christened it “the most vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop.”

  zh: 这些联系在 2015 年达到了临界点，当时 SoundCloud 说唱音乐开始被主流听众所熟知，像 Lil Peep、Smokepurpp、XXXtentacion
    和 Juice WRLD 这样的新秀开始崭露头角。即使对于以其庞大的声音目录而闻名的 SoundCloud 来说，SoundCloud 说唱——叛逆、崇尚药物、充满情绪折磨的故事——也是一种全新的体验。*纽约时报*
    将其称为“嘻哈乐中最重要、最具破坏性的新运动。”
