    Sheck Wes’ “Mo Bamba.” The commonalities these artists and songs share is neither
    region nor genre but platform. [SoundCloud](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/soundclouds-new-venture-mixes-social-network-music-service/)
    was their origin point. “It sparked so many careers once upon a time,” says [Stonie
    Blue](https://soundcloud.com/antbluejr), a New York-based DJ and cofounder of
    [BIYDIY Records](http://www.biydiy.online/). “Artists could upload their music
    straight to the community that would lurk there before the main focus was streaming
    on [Apple Music](https://www.wired.com/tag/apple-music/) or [Spotify](https://www.wired.com/tag/spotify/).”
    Blue joined the platform in 2012, and in that time, he's come across newbie artists
    like Sango, Dream Koala, Yeek, and WOLFE de MÇHLS. “SoundCloud,” he says, “always
    felt like the underground.”

    That''s been the case since it launched in 2007\. The Berlin-founded company has
    maintained its relevance by embracing a simple ethos: come as you are. That’s
    made SoundCloud the for-everybody platform—one that embraces all genres, sexualities,
    religions, and definitions of music and art. By setting itself up as a hub for
    community-oriented music streaming, it’s become a kind of incubator for avant-garde
    sounds. Today, SoundCloud is everybody’s underground.'

    this year, according to [multiple reports](https://news.sky.com/story/music-streaming-service-soundcloud-tunes-up-for-sale-13043602),
    a move the company has been working on for some time. In 2017, SoundCloud nearly
    shut down when it was reported that the company would run out of funding within
    two months. Thanks to a last-minute $170 million cash infusion from investment
    firms Raine Group and Temasek Holdings, and [a little help](https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud.html)
    from Chance the Rapper, the company was saved from termination. Raine Group and
    Temasek are now reportedly seeking a payday of upwards of $1 billion. With news
    of a possible sale, what hangs in the balance is the possible loss of what has
    made SoundCloud such a unique platform, and the impact that rupture could have
    on the future of the music business.

    producer known as [IAMNOBODI](https://soundcloud.com/iamnobodi). “Wouldn’t be
    where I am today if it wasn’t for SoundCloud. I was able to make a name for myself
    by uploading songs and DJ mixes that people all over the world connected with.
    I became a part of [music collective] Soulection through this platform.”

    worked with Nipsey Hussle, Little Simz, and Bryson Tiller, says community was
    always at its heart, and what it stood for. “If anything, SoundCloud was about
    having fun and connecting with like-minded individuals globally,” Ademabua says.

    itself to mainstream ears, as upstarts Lil Peep, Smokepurpp, XXXtentacion, and
    Juice WRLD began to make noise. Even for SoundCloud, a platform notorious for
    its exhaustive catalog of sounds, SoundCloud rap—rebellious, drug-friendly, and
    swirling with tales of emo torment—was like nothing else on the scene. *The New
    York Times* christened it “the most vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop.”
