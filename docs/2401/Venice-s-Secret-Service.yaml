- en: The major ruling body described in the book is the Council of Ten. Actually
    seventeen men, the Council of Ten was the state security body under the Doge.
    Serving in the Council of Ten was both an honour and a source of immense power,
    but it also brought restrictions and inconveniences. The heads of the ten were
    not allowed to frequent certain public places, and members who leaked secrets
    could face executions.

  zh: 该书描述的主要统治机构是十人议会。实际上，十人议会由十七名男子组成，是执掌国家安全的机构，位于多吉的统治之下。在十人议会任职既是一种荣誉，也是一种巨大权力的来源，但同时也带来了限制和不便。十人之首不被允许频繁出入某些公共场所，而泄露机密的成员可能会面临处决。
- en: Iordanou argues that Venice’s secret service was special in the concert of European
    powers. Philip II of Spain was very well informed, because he was a micro-manager.
    He directed every detail of his secret service and cryptology department personally.
    Spanish secretaries, for example, worked at their homes, which was highly inefficient
    and led to misplaced documents and leaked secrets.

  zh: 约尔丹努认为，威尼斯的秘密服务在欧洲列强中是独特的。西班牙的腓力二世非常了解情报，因为他是一位微观管理者。他亲自指导其秘密服务和密码部门的每一个细节。例如，西班牙的秘书在家里工作，这是非常低效的，导致文件丢失和机密泄露。
- en: In contrast, Venice used managerial practices like delegating tasks to inferior
    officers and managing whole information flows between several officials, as well
    as formal reports from its officials and the development of a professional identity,
    although the words “management” and “professionalization” are problematic when
    used to describe pre-modern practices.

  zh: 相比之下，威尼斯使用了管理实践，如将任务委派给下级官员，并在多个官员之间管理整个信息流，以及来自其官员的正式报告和专业身份的发展，尽管在描述现代前实践时使用“管理”和“专业化”这些词语是有问题的。
- en: Secrecy is commonly thought as limiting exchange of information. But it is also
    instrumental in enabling this sharing, because only by clearly demarcating people
    “in the know” from outsiders, those in possession of the information can know
    who is allowed to receive information about secret affairs. People on the inside
    can freely discuss secret issues, without fear of improperly disclosing them.

  zh: 保密通常被认为会限制信息交流。但它也有助于促进这种分享，因为只有明确将知情者与外人区分开来，才能知道谁有资格接收关于秘密事务的信息。内部人员可以自由讨论秘密问题，而不必担心错误地泄露它们。
- en: Secrecy was also a tool of governing the city. The Ten used secret information
    to shape internal Venetian politics, even keeping important information from city
    bodies they notionally reported to, like the Senate. Venice also used anonymous
    tip boxes distributed like post boxes, where citizens could report on and denuciate
    wach other, offer information – sometimes directly attaching their price. They
    did so with some fervor, reporting on other people was very common. Some citizens
    even paid scribes to pen those denunciations beautifully. Those tips and offers
    were then scrupulously read, evaluated and, if deemed important and true, acted
    upon.

  zh: 保密也是统治城市的一种工具。十人利用秘密信息塑造内部威尼斯政治，甚至向理论上向其报告的城市机构，如参议院，隐瞒重要信息。威尼斯还使用匿名提示箱，类似邮筒，市民可以在其中互相举报，提供信息，有时直接附上报酬。他们这样做有一些热情，互相举报是非常普遍的。一些市民甚至雇佣文士将这些举报写得漂亮。这些提示和报价然后被认真阅读，评估，并且，如果被认为重要和真实，则采取行动。
- en: Including the class of commoner citizens into handling secret information was
    a way to give them status, pride and a limited sense of power, even though the
    higher echelons of state service were closed to them. Venice used such limited
    inclusion deftly and systematically as an administrative elite.

  zh: 将普通市民纳入处理机密信息的范畴是给予他们地位、自豪感和有限的权力感的一种方式，尽管国家服务的高层是关闭给他们的。威尼斯巧妙而系统地将这种有限的包容性作为行政精英使用。
- en: The most ordinary use of secrecy was keeping communication channels with Venice’s
    diplomats open and secure. Different ciphers were used for communications of different
    criticality, which is why Venice and the other powers continuously developed new
    ciphers. Diplomats and military leaders in a region shared keys, which were exchanged
    by courier, and officials were often directed to distribute keys for other officials.
    This had lots of potential for mess-ups, and the archives hold many letters of
    officials complaining that some other official has been writing to them in undecipherable
    code. In those cases, the central department of cryptology had to dispatch new
    keys and ciphers to both, or direct yet another official to share his key with
    the “out-of-sync” official.

  zh: 最普通的保密用途是保持与威尼斯外交官的通信渠道畅通且安全。不同的关键性通信使用不同的密码，这就是为什么威尼斯和其他大国不断发展新密码。一个地区的外交官和军事领导者分享密钥，密钥由信使交换，官员经常被指示分发给其他官员的密钥。这有很多潜在的错误，档案中保存着许多官员抱怨其他官员用不可解密的密码给他们写信的信件。在这些情况下，密码中心部门必须向两者派发新的密钥和密码，或者指示另一位官员与“不同步”的官员分享他的密钥。

- en: Venice also had an excellent official postal service, but exclusively for official
    use. Other states also used Venice’s messaging channels, especially toward the
    Ottomans in the East. Of course, Venice had no scruples opening those communications,
    deciphering them, and re-sealing the envelopes. Unless the other state was powerful
    and Venice feared military attacks. In such cases there were official orders from
    Venice to its diplomats and couriers not to mess with those communications. There
    are also humourous stories where a papal nuncio wrote unencrypted messages, so
    that they were not being delayed by the Venetians.

  zh: 威尼斯还拥有一流的官方邮政服务，但仅限于官方使用。其他国家也使用威尼斯的消息渠道，尤其是对东方的奥斯曼人。当然，威尼斯毫不犹豫地打开这些通讯，解密它们，然后重新封好信封。除非其他国家实力强大，威尼斯担心军事进攻。在这种情况下，威尼斯会向其外交官和信使发布正式命令，不要干扰那些通讯。还有一些幽默的故事，比如教皇的使节写了未加密的信息，以便它们不会被威尼斯人拖延。
- en: Venice’s cryptology department was usually centered upon a foremost cryptologer,
    who was also responsible for educating new recruits. He got special affordances,
    like being allowed to choose new recruits himself. This contributed to the department
    of cryptology being a nepotic affair. Younger family members were often selected
    and preferred. Iordanou sees this as much less nefarious than it looks to the
    modern reader. Venice’s leaders assumed cryptologic talent to run in the family,
    they assumed that familial exposure to cryptology would have fostered that talent
    even more, and it was also a form of payment, especially since remuneration for
    long and well executed services could be lavish, but often weren’t. In general,
    Venice’s leadership cared for family members of officials having suffered in service,
    especially to the bereaved of Venetian amateur spys and agents on dangerous missions.
    Recruits learned either by oral lectures or reading written accounts of earlier
    cryptologists. After a few years of instruction they had to pass a harsh written
    examination before being fully appointed, although as favor to the head cryptologer
    even that could be waived when it came to his family members.

  zh: 威尼斯的密码学部门通常以一位卓越的密码学家为中心，他还负责培养新的招募人员。他得到了特殊的待遇，比如被允许自己选择新的招募人员。这导致了密码学部门成为一个裙带关系。年轻的家庭成员经常被选中和优先考虑。伊奥尔达努认为这远没有现代读者看起来那么邪恶。威尼斯的领导人认为密码学才能在家族中流传，他们认为家庭对密码学的接触会更加促进这种才能的发展，这也是一种支付形式，尤其是因为长期和出色的服务可能会得到丰厚的报酬，但通常不会。总的来说，威尼斯的领导层关心官员的家庭成员在服务中遭受的苦难，尤其是对威尼斯业余间谍和执行危险任务的代理人的丧失者。招募人员通过口头讲座或阅读早期密码学家的书面记录学习。经过几年的指导，他们必须通过严格的书面考试才能获得完全任命，尽管对于主要密码学家的家庭成员，即使在这种情况下也可以免除。

    research, they set up training programs for new cryptologers, and they set up
    a whole department of cryptology that handled both defensive development of new

    handled cryptology as a secret secret, with the death penalty thereatened for

    diplomats, when repudiability, convenience or inconspicuousness called for it.
    Curiously, Venice never developed a professional spy force, like the professional
    cryptologers. Instead it relied mostly on amateurs, criminals and other people
    paid for with sometimes huge, sometimes only meagre amounts of money, and sometimes
    with favors, especially the release or un-banishment of criminals.
