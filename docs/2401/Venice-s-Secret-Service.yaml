- en: '**Venice’s Secret Service** by **Ioanna Iordanou** undertakes to show that
    organized intelligence is not – as commonly thought – an invention of the modern
    industrial state, but already existed in Renaissance Venice of the 1500s and early
    1600s.'

    vying with states like France and England for supremacy.

- en: The major ruling body described in the book is the Council of Ten. Actually
    seventeen men, the Council of Ten was the state security body under the Doge.
    Serving in the Council of Ten was both an honour and a source of immense power,
    but it also brought restrictions and inconveniences. The heads of the ten were
    not allowed to frequent certain public places, and members who leaked secrets
    could face executions.

- en: Iordanou argues that Venice’s secret service was special in the concert of European
    powers. Philip II of Spain was very well informed, because he was a micro-manager.
    He directed every detail of his secret service and cryptology department personally.
    Spanish secretaries, for example, worked at their homes, which was highly inefficient
    and led to misplaced documents and leaked secrets.

    officers and managing whole information flows between several officials, as well
    as formal reports from its officials and the development of a professional identity,
    although the words “management” and “professionalization” are problematic when
    used to describe pre-modern practices.

- en: Secrecy is commonly thought as limiting exchange of information. But it is also
    instrumental in enabling this sharing, because only by clearly demarcating people
    “in the know” from outsiders, those in possession of the information can know
    who is allowed to receive information about secret affairs. People on the inside
    can freely discuss secret issues, without fear of improperly disclosing them.

- en: Secrecy was also a tool of governing the city. The Ten used secret information
    to shape internal Venetian politics, even keeping important information from city
    bodies they notionally reported to, like the Senate. Venice also used anonymous
    tip boxes distributed like post boxes, where citizens could report on and denuciate
    wach other, offer information – sometimes directly attaching their price. They
    did so with some fervor, reporting on other people was very common. Some citizens
    even paid scribes to pen those denunciations beautifully. Those tips and offers
    were then scrupulously read, evaluated and, if deemed important and true, acted
    upon.

- en: Including the class of commoner citizens into handling secret information was
    a way to give them status, pride and a limited sense of power, even though the
    higher echelons of state service were closed to them. Venice used such limited
    inclusion deftly and systematically as an administrative elite.

- en: The most ordinary use of secrecy was keeping communication channels with Venice’s
    diplomats open and secure. Different ciphers were used for communications of different
    criticality, which is why Venice and the other powers continuously developed new
    ciphers. Diplomats and military leaders in a region shared keys, which were exchanged
    by courier, and officials were often directed to distribute keys for other officials.
    This had lots of potential for mess-ups, and the archives hold many letters of
    officials complaining that some other official has been writing to them in undecipherable
    code. In those cases, the central department of cryptology had to dispatch new
    keys and ciphers to both, or direct yet another official to share his key with
    the “out-of-sync” official.

    but they were also assigned clerks to take off the load in day-to-day operations.

- en: Venice also had an excellent official postal service, but exclusively for official
    use. Other states also used Venice’s messaging channels, especially toward the
    Ottomans in the East. Of course, Venice had no scruples opening those communications,
    deciphering them, and re-sealing the envelopes. Unless the other state was powerful
    and Venice feared military attacks. In such cases there were official orders from
    Venice to its diplomats and couriers not to mess with those communications. There
    are also humourous stories where a papal nuncio wrote unencrypted messages, so
    that they were not being delayed by the Venetians.

- en: Venice’s cryptology department was usually centered upon a foremost cryptologer,
    who was also responsible for educating new recruits. He got special affordances,
    like being allowed to choose new recruits himself. This contributed to the department
    of cryptology being a nepotic affair. Younger family members were often selected
    and preferred. Iordanou sees this as much less nefarious than it looks to the
    modern reader. Venice’s leaders assumed cryptologic talent to run in the family,
    they assumed that familial exposure to cryptology would have fostered that talent
    even more, and it was also a form of payment, especially since remuneration for
    long and well executed services could be lavish, but often weren’t. In general,
    Venice’s leadership cared for family members of officials having suffered in service,
    especially to the bereaved of Venetian amateur spys and agents on dangerous missions.
    Recruits learned either by oral lectures or reading written accounts of earlier
    cryptologists. After a few years of instruction they had to pass a harsh written
    examination before being fully appointed, although as favor to the head cryptologer
    even that could be waived when it came to his family members.

- en: Venice’s Council of Ten deemed cryptology important and fostered cryptology
    research, they set up training programs for new cryptologers, and they set up
    a whole department of cryptology that handled both defensive development of new
    ciphers and offensive breaking of adversaries (and friends’) ciphers. They also
    handled cryptology as a secret secret, with the death penalty thereatened for
    cipher or key misuse.

- en: Merchants were expected to collect information and pass it on to Venetian authorities,
    but they were sometimes also used by the Council of Ten in preference to its own
    diplomats, when repudiability, convenience or inconspicuousness called for it.
    Curiously, Venice never developed a professional spy force, like the professional
    cryptologers. Instead it relied mostly on amateurs, criminals and other people
    paid for with sometimes huge, sometimes only meagre amounts of money, and sometimes
    with favors, especially the release or un-banishment of criminals.

- en: The book is academic and mostly dry in style, and Iordanou is much too fond
    of the word “redolent”, but is is a fascinating window into early professional
    cryptology.
