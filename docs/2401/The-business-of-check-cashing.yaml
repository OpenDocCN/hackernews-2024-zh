    the status of a debt with some level of certainty associated with it. A check
    is a specially formatted message. The “movement” of money tomorrow is another
    message. But neither of those messages encode absolute certainty that the payer
    is *certainly* discharging their debt to the payee.

- en: If something goes wrong in this process—the overwhelmingly most likely one is
    that the payer doesn’t have the funds to cover the check (NSF, or “insufficient
    funds”), but the check being fraudulent or unauthorized is also possible—that
    wrongness may not be discovered before money “moves” to your bank. And so that
    payment can be recalled from your bank to the bank the check is drawn on. This
    will likely result in the bank attempting to recall the money from your account.
  id: totrans-22

  zh: 如果在这个过程中出了问题——最有可能的是付款人没有足够的资金来支付支票（不足额，即“资金不足”），但支票是欺诈或未经授权的也有可能——那种错误可能在钱“流动”到你的银行之前就被发现。所以那笔付款可以从你的银行收回到支票所在的银行。这可能会导致银行试图从你的账户中收回资金。
- en: And so by presenting your check, which you *think* is substantially terminating
    a transaction, you are actually creating a *new credit extension* with your bank.
    They are extremely aware that you just asked them to advance you money, even if
    you are not aware that you did that. They already partially underwrote this extension

    our best estimate is you’ll bounce multiple times per year, our desired outcome
    is you make us whole and pay a modest penalty under our agreement. We assess that
    you present a material risk of not doing this. You might have gotten an A for
    92% in school but if your checks are 92% likely to be good money that’s a hard
    no from us. We decline to extend you credit under this product. We may extend
    you credit in other fashions, if you ask. You’ll find that in those products credit

  zh: 看一下英格的[费用](https://app.ingomoney.com/benefits-fees/)，并将其与传统的现金兑现的代表性费用进行比较。对于一张500美元的支票，这款App的费用是5美元，而砖砌现金支票的费用是11.65美元。这就是金融科技的梦想；差额基本上完全是“你的成本就是我们的利润。”因为金融科技的噩梦是“我们的客户获取成本解释了为什么人们依然为在高流量区域的商业地点支付租金”，因此有一个忠诚度计划，为重复使用提供高额折扣。

    to wait ten days, Ingo will discount your fee straight to zero. Why ten days?
    It is past the window where fraud discovery will result in the funds being clawed
    back plus (ahem) a bit of annoyance tacked on as a product decision.'

  zh: 然后还有一个决定在审美上我非常喜欢：如果你愿意等待十天，英格会直接把你的费用打折到零。为什么是十天？这是超过了欺诈发现窗口，这将导致资金被收回，并且（咳咳）作为产品决策添加了一点点恼人的东西。
- en: I expect very few of their customers take them up on that. Most McDonalds burgers
    are not consumed by people who can cook a burger at home. They lack that capability;
    understanding this is an important part of understanding their life and the role
    of McDonalds in it. But free check cashing being available now where it wasn’t
    before is a straight-up win for the customers and the world.

  zh: 我预料很少有他们的客户会采纳这个方案。大多数麦当劳汉堡不是被会在家做汉堡的人消费的。他们缺乏这方面的能力；理解这一点是了解他们的生活及麦当劳在其中扮演的角色的重要部分。但现在免费的兑现支票服务可用了，之前是不存在的，这对客户和世界都是一种纯赢。
- en: Another model is embedding the check cashing into a larger suite of services.
    Cash App is a notable standout here (and, IMHO, probably the most interesting
    financial product the tech industry has created for the un-/underbanked.) On the
    backend, Cash App has simply convinced a bank to have a wider risk envelope as
    part of the price for working with a client who represents a very large portfolio
    of customers. The most useful thing Cash App can convince those users to do, which
    it spends *substantial* effort on doing, is signing up for direct deposit to their
    Cash App. (Really, it is to the partner bank, but from the user’s perspective
    eh it shows up in Cash App and all their friends use Cash App and you could turn
    it into actual paper money so does it really matter what some bank in Nebraska
    thinks? Nobody there will ever talk to you or talk down to you, so no.)

  zh: 另一个模型是将兑现支票作为更大的服务套件的一部分。现金App在这方面是一个显著的亮点（而且，在我看来，可能是科技行业为无户口人或少有管制权限的人群所创造的最有趣的金融产品）。在后台，现金App简单地说服了一家银行让他们的风险范围更宽泛，这是与代表庞大客户组合的客户合作的价格的一部分。现金App可以说服那些用户做的最有用的事情，它花了*相当大的*努力在做的事情，就是在现金App上注册直接存款。（实际上，是到合作银行的，但从用户的角度看，它显示在现金App上，而且他们的朋友都使用现金App，你可以把它变成实际的纸币，所以真的很重要一个内布拉斯加州的银行认为什么？那里没有人会和你交谈或看不起你，所以不重要。）

    for this form of financial service. The [continued march](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/payroll-providers-power-respect/)

    the pockets of workers, even those in diminished circumstances.

  zh: 这里还有其他模型，还有其他因素在减少对这种形式的金融服务的需求。直接存款和应得工资访问产品的[持续](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/payroll-providers-power-respect/)使更多的工资留在工人口袋里，甚至是处境困难的工人。
- en: One useful thing the advocates (and others) accomplished over the last twenty
    years was convincing public benefits distributors to not solely use checks to
    distribute benefits. For example, "electronic benefit transfer" (EBT) replace
    the monthly check with a specialized variant of a pre-paid card which can be refilled.
    This *sometimes* results in the cost of distribution falling less on beneficiaries.
    *Sometimes*.

  zh: 支持者（和其他人）在过去二十年中取得的一个有用的成就是说服公共福利分配者不仅仅使用支票来分发福利。例如，“电子福利转账”（EBT）用专门的预付卡的变种来取代每月的支票，这个卡可以充值。*有时候*，这导致分配成本减少得不那么多落在受益者身上。*有时候*。
