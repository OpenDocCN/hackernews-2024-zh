    wrongness may not be discovered before money “moves” to your bank. And so that
    payment can be recalled from your bank to the bank the check is drawn on. This

    to us have a much-higher-than-baseline risk of bouncing. When they bounce, and
    our best estimate is you’ll bounce multiple times per year, our desired outcome
    is you make us whole and pay a modest penalty under our agreement. We assess that
    you present a material risk of not doing this. You might have gotten an A for
    92% in school but if your checks are 92% likely to be good money that’s a hard
    no from us. We decline to extend you credit under this product. We may extend
    you credit in other fashions, if you ask. You’ll find that in those products credit
    costs a lot more than the cheap credit embedded in checking accounts, reflecting

    This means signing it and optionally leaving the bank an instruction as to what
    to do with the check. This is established by a combination of law and ancient
    practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common endorsement historically is that you can endorse a check to another
    person, i.e. instruct the bank to make payment to the person you nominate, not
    to you. This enabled many use cases back in the day. A family might have two people
    earning wages but only one with title to a bank account; the second could endorse
    their wages to the first. A business could endorse a payment made by a customer
    to the business’ owner or to an employee or to a supplier. A common endorsement
    was simply “pay to cash.” (Banks hate that one and mostly don’t offer it any more.
    You can probably predict why.)

    you can *endorse your check to the check casher*. As of that moment, by the magic
    that is the U.S. legal system, your payer no longer owes you money; they now owe
    the check casher money. The now-endorsed check instructs the check casher’s bank
    and the payer’s bank to cooperate to make this side agreement happen.

    risk *directly*, they have operational risk which becomes a credit risk. In the
    case where either the person cashing them isn't the person named on the check,
    or where the government later comes to the conclusion that it didn't *really*
    want to pay them, that money could (at some risk) be clawed back from the bank,

    poor people end up liking her is her job. Don’t take my word for it; take the
    customers’. We have studied this industry extensively. We ran surveys. The customers
    keep saying things like “I like my local check cashing place because the girl
    behind the counter is kind and doesn’t judge me like those #%*(#%( at the bank.”
    You can present as being kind to almost all of your customers and be *obviously
    unemployable* as a bank teller.'

    counter” language about the 0.01% most aggravating customer *once,* you will not
    be a bank teller tomorrow. So bank tellers basically never use those words, and
    instead can inflect “Can I help you, sir?” in a way which leaves *absolutely*
    no doubt as to how welcome the new arrival to the branch is.

    visit a currency exchange if you have a checking account. In time, the literature
    actually learned to ask that question and found that, decisively, no, some banked
    people *do* happily pay to cash checks. This observation caused some confusion.
    I am confused why this fact is confusing; some people who are capable of cooking
    have also been known to go to McDonalds, even though McDonalds isn’t free and
    doesn’t taste like a burger at home. That is, of course, *one of the points of
    going to McDonalds*.

    delineate between unbanked and underbanked. It will frequently come down to “Underbanked
    means you’re not unbanked but you still ~~eat at McDonalds~~ consume alternative
    financial services.” See this [representative example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10623889/).)

    reason why check cashing costs money, and that many unbanked or underbanked customers
    do not have happy human interactions with financial service providers, you might
    wonder if technology can successfully cash checks while being cheaper and less

    you towards a couple of models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In one, a pure-play company like Ingo Money has both a direct-to-consumer offering
    and some ability to whitelabel it. (A whitelabel arrangement means that some other
    firm does the work of attracting the customers and then uses Ingo’s technology
    stack, financial rails, licenses, or any subset of the above to provide the check
    cashing service. To the customer, this feels a lot like they're "just" using the
    partner the whole time.) Ingo lets you essentially do remote deposit capture but
    instead of the deposit being to a bank account and there being a hold period,
    deposit is to an alternative financial product (like e.g. a prepaid card) and
    the funds are released basically instantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a look at Ingo’s [fees](https://app.ingomoney.com/benefits-fees/) and compare
    them to the representative fees for brick-and-mortar cash checking. For a $500
    paycheck, it’s $5 versus $11.65 in favor of the app. This is the fintech dream;
    the delta is basically entirely “your costs are our margin.” Because the fintech
    nightmare is “our costs of customer acquisition explain why people still pay rent
    for commercial locations in high-traffic areas”, there is a loyalty program which
    gives steep discounts for repeated use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'And then there’s one decision which I just love aesthetically: if you’re willing
    to wait ten days, Ingo will discount your fee straight to zero. Why ten days?
    It is past the window where fraud discovery will result in the funds being clawed
    back plus (ahem) a bit of annoyance tacked on as a product decision.'

- en: I expect very few of their customers take them up on that. Most McDonalds burgers
    are not consumed by people who can cook a burger at home. They lack that capability;
    understanding this is an important part of understanding their life and the role
    of McDonalds in it. But free check cashing being available now where it wasn’t
    before is a straight-up win for the customers and the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another model is embedding the check cashing into a larger suite of services.
    Cash App is a notable standout here (and, IMHO, probably the most interesting
    financial product the tech industry has created for the un-/underbanked.) On the
    backend, Cash App has simply convinced a bank to have a wider risk envelope as
    part of the price for working with a client who represents a very large portfolio
    of customers. The most useful thing Cash App can convince those users to do, which
    it spends *substantial* effort on doing, is signing up for direct deposit to their
    Cash App. (Really, it is to the partner bank, but from the user’s perspective
    eh it shows up in Cash App and all their friends use Cash App and you could turn
    it into actual paper money so does it really matter what some bank in Nebraska
    thinks? Nobody there will ever talk to you or talk down to you, so no.)

    people who are above average risk. You can read [elsewhere](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiny-banks-that-powered-cash-app-grew-like-crazy-then-the-feds-came-calling)

    the pockets of workers, even those in diminished circumstances.

    years was convincing public benefits distributors to not solely use checks to
    distribute benefits. For example, "electronic benefit transfer" (EBT) replace
    the monthly check with a specialized variant of a pre-paid card which can be refilled.
    This *sometimes* results in the cost of distribution falling less on beneficiaries.
