- en: Can honestly say this keyboard case is GREAT! Brilliant design and it gets SO
    MUCH attention everywhere I go… People literally go out of their way to ask me
    what phone I’m using and when I tell them it’s an iPhone they ask me where they
    can buy one. I just wish Clicks would send me a commission check :-)

- en: Seriously though, if you buy one just make sure you check out the getting started
    guide so you understand how to hold it properly and how it works and go into it
    with some patience. You’re likely not going to be good with it immediately right
    out of the box.

- en: I hadn’t typed on buttons since I had a BlackBerry Bold so I was more than a
    bit rusty at the start. But I spent a few hours over a couple days practicing
    and then it really “clicked”… I’m super fast on it now can even type without looking!
    Love my Clicks!!
