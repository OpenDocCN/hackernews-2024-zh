- en: At *New Scientist* last week, science writer and editor [George Musser](https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/george-musser/)
    talked about the way a theory of consciousness that sees the brain as a quantum
    system is now under reluctant consideration. Musser, author of *[Putting Ourselves
    Back in the Equation](https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Ourselves-Back-Equation-Consciousness/dp/0374238766)*
    (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2023) went to visit anesthesiologist [Stuart Hameroff,](https://www.quantumconsciousness.org/content/overview-sh)
    who — with theoretical physicist [Roger Penrose](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-Penrose)
    — advances the quantum-based [Orch Or](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064513001188)
    Theory *(orchestrated objective reduction of the quantum state).*

    experience arises from quantum phenomena in the brain. The theory gained little
    traction in the past because it was difficult to test but Musser thinks that the
    use of anesthetics on [brain organoids](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30992274/)
    (lumps of brain tissue grown in a medium), along with other new methods may enable
    the theory to be tested:'

    research for decades. They have never come in from the cold because, as their
    critics argue, there is no solid experimental evidence that quantum effects occur
    in the brain, never mind a clear idea of how they would give rise to consciousness.

    located somewhere but rather as a cloud of probabilities. If observed, it collapses
    into the state in which it was observed. Penrose has postulated that “each time
    a quantum wave function collapses in this way in the brain, it gives rise to a
    moment of conscious experience.”

    of neurons. He postulates that “microtubules inside neurons could be exploiting
    quantum effects, somehow translating gravitationally induced wave function collapse
    into consciousness, as Penrose had suggested.” Thus was born a collaboration,
    though their seminal 1996 [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0378475496804769)
    failed to gain much traction.

    (1916–2004) proclaimed, “You’re nothing but a pack of neurons.” In those days,
    many thought that materialism had already won and no more sophisticated analysis

    and orientation of the magnetic field. The thinking is that the bird is sensitive
    to this in a way that allows it to tell north from south. The process is highly
    quantum as the radical pair electrons are entangled, which means that they act
    as a single quantum object, even though they are some distance apart.
