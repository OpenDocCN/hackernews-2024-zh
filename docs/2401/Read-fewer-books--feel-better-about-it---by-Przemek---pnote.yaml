    give us books they think we *really should* read. (That‚Äôs how I received a copy

    Read More Books in 2024‚Äù. Everyone around you and their mother is joining a book

    would be very cool to read 40 books that year. I don‚Äôt remember *why* I thought
    that‚Äôs a good idea, but it had something to do with books representing knowledge,
    growth, insights, etc.

    I had a moment of panic when I realized I‚Äôm still way off track. Then I read a
    lot of short books back-to-back and baaam, on December 27 I finished the 40th
    book (Solaris), completing the challenge.
