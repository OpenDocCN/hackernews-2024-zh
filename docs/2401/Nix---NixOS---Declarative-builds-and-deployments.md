# Nix & NixOS | Declarative builds and deployments

> 来源：[https://nixos.org/](https://nixos.org/)

Nix builds packages in isolation from each other. This ensures that they are reproducible and don’t have undeclared dependencies, so **if a package works on one machine, it will also work on another.**
