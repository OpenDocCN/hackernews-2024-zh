- en: Climate change disinformation on YouTube has morphed into a misleading new narrative,
    according to a [report](https://counterhate.com/research/new-climate-denial/)
    published today. With [compounding disasters](/2021/9/3/22654003/floods-wildfires-hurricane-ida-climate-change-disasters-compound-risks)
    making it harder to deny that climate change is happening, creators spreading
    disinformation have pivoted to content that targets clean energy.

    happening or not a result of humans burning fossil fuels dominated disinformation
    channels. That’s not the case anymore, according to an analysis by the nonprofit
    Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Instead, the most common lies about
    climate change now have to do with denying the benefits of clean energy, attacking
    policies meant to slash planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels, and maligning
    scientists and advocates that push for change.

- en: This kind of “new denial” made up 70 percent of climate-denying content on YouTube
    in 2023, according to the report, compared to 35 percent in 2018\. It largely
    centers around deceptive messages that “climate solutions won’t work,” that the
    science backing those solutions is unreliable, or that global warming isn’t actually
    harmful.

    gas emissions from fossil fuels are causing climate change, that those emissions
    are supercharging deadly weather disasters, and that transitioning to clean energy
    is the only way to tackle the problem at scale.

    from Canadian pundit Jordan Peterson over the last few years. “The idea that we
    can make the planet more habitable on an environmental, on the environmental front
    by impoverishing poor people, by raising energy prices and food prices, is absolutely,
    it’s not only absurd logically, but I think it’s tantamount to genocidal,” Peterson
    says in one YouTube video his channel posted in 2022\.

    Climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths each year in the
    coming decades as it raises risks from heat stress, malaria, undernutrition, and
    diarrhea, [according to the World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health).
    Fortunately, renewable energy is already [a cheaper alternative](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/executive-summary)
    to fossil fuel power plants and can help prevent deaths linked to the effects
    of climate change.

    disinformation, the report authors say. They found that the company was running
    ads on that kind of content, even though it has a [policy](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321?hl=en#:~:text=Addressing%20climate%20change%20denial&text=That's%20why%20today%2C%20we're,and%20causes%20of%20climate%20change.)

    monetize and amplify lies about the climate,” CCDH CEO and founder Imran Ahmed
    said in a press release. “It is time for digital platforms to put their money
    where their mouth is. They should refuse to amplify or monetize cynical climate
    denial content that undermines faith in our collective capacity to solve humanity’s

    Google spokesperson Nate Funkhouser said in an email that, “Debate or discussions
    of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed.
    However, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing
    ads on those videos.” The company said it removed ads from some of the videos
    mentioned in the report for violating its policy, but that a majority of the videos
    mentioned were compliant.

    viewers. In a poll of more than 1,000 teenagers in the US between the ages of

    a third of teenagers said “climate policies cause more harm than good.”
