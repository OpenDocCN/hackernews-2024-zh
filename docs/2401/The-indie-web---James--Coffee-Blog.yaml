    a rough time for an anxious student like I was. I did not know I was suffering
    from anxiety at the time; that is a recent realisation. Being open about anxiety
    is a challenge. How you think, when written as a raw thought, might have undertones
    of paranoia. I was *worried* about cooking an egg, without knowing my exact worries.
    For other foods, my worry was always food poisioning; if I cook, I'll get ill.

    but there is one in particular that motivated me to share my story with more people
    through this blog: Someone else wrote about their experiences with mental health
    on their blog. That blog post played a role in helping me overcome the stigma
    associated with mental health; they probably don''t know that, either. In being
    open, I felt less lonely. I found people who could help. And, eventually, I found
    people who imbued me with enough confidence to cook an egg. I am incredibly proud
    of that accomplishment.'

    The community (capital "I" and "W") is where I found a home to positively channel
    a feeling of malaise I had about the web. When I joined, my outlook on the web
    was forever changed. The web is *ours*. I can publish a blog and share my words.
    There are now other communities I'm in that share the same values.

    or coding, or Scrabble, or mental health. I could have a personal website that
    is my place on the web, operating at a slower pace than other sites. I can *be*.

    punk music scene, a rich part of the nation's culture. Punk music is about creativity.
    Pushing the boundaries. Expressing emotions. It defines its own rules. Those rules
    change. This, I think, is a good characterisation of the indie web. Be yourself.
    Push boundaries. Above all, have fun.

    independence of agency to associate, and who embraces the web of humans that want
    to interconnect, to communicate, to value and respect each other, whether one
    degree apart or thirty.

    You are saying: I want to define my experience on the web. I''ll let you in on
    an open secret: Big tech companies aren''t the only ones who get to decide how
    we share ideas on the web. The web is yours. You can put up a website where you
    share whatever it is that you want to share with others.'
