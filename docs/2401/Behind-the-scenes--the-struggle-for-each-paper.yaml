    task turned into three rewrites of an application, two studies, and one long faculty
    mentorship. Neither of us could predict that Bo would graduate before the main

    even familiarize myself with the equations in the paper.

    Android and iOS apps separately, and a server to do the calculations. It was a
    costly mistake to build out three separate systems; we should have started with
    something cross-platform and performed the calculations in the app itself to reduce
    the software maintenance from three systems to one.

  zh: Nedi 将她早期的 SleepCoacher 论文转变为了一个完全自动化的过程，完成了我们 6 年前的一个想法的愿景。本文描述的产品已经在应用商店中发布，并被任何遇到并下载它的人使用，基本上是我们没有招募的人的真实使用。我们分别维护
    Android 和 iOS 应用，以及一个用于执行计算的服务器。构建三个独立系统是一个昂贵的错误；我们应该从跨平台的东西开始，并在应用程序中执行计算，以将三个系统的软件维护减少到一个系统。
- en: The paper was hard to publish, because unlike recruited and paid participants,
    our 5,000 app store installs (now 7,700) led to messy data—a lot of people never
    opened the app, or did so only once. Reviewers were unimpressed that thousands
    of installs only led to a couple hundred active participants, of which only about
    a fifth of the users tracked for enough nights to get useful information.

  zh: 这篇论文很难发表，因为与被招募和付费参与者不同，我们的 5,000 次应用商店安装（现在为 7,700 次）导致了混乱的数据——很多人从未打开过应用，或者只打开过一次。审阅人员对成千上万的安装只带来了几百名活跃参与者印象不佳，其中只有大约五分之一的用户连续跟踪了足够的夜晚以获得有用信息。

    it could be acceptable if shepherded, "I am still leaning positive given the difficulty
    of the method, the importance of the topic, and complexity of the project as a
    whole." Being on the program committee myself that year, I wondered to another
    faculty member why our papers always seem to only barely get in, and they responded
    matter-of-factly, "all accepted papers barely get in," referring to the declining
    average scores at CHI over the years.

    CHI 的平均分数下降。

    where I proposed a classroom tool for large-class simultaneous design activities.
    But the code was written and rewritten several times by different teams even after
    that, because running a real-time collaborative system with over 100 simultaneous
    users introduced its own share of problems.

    a collaboration, where we concluded that the area of mental health lacked innovative
    computational techniques. I did a rough prototype of our initial idea in 2015,
    then students picked it up the following year. The work was passed between teams
    of students, mainly supporting the application development and real usage from
    a growing list of collaborators. It turns out that many clinical researchers felt
    the same, and this became our most funded project.

    2018 and 2019\. The hard part was because while we were using a fairly unique
    approach, I didn't have much experience writing about this topic. Reviewers would
    have varying opinions of what needed to change, so the text would waffle back
    and forth; we finally arrived at a version of the paper that was satisfying enough,

    got poor reviews or multiple rejections. They're usually about a new phenomenon,
