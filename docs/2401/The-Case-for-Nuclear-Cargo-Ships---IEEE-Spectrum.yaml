    study with Fincantieri will guide how the two companies develop the technology
    for marine use. “Small modular reactors are a relatively new technology, but the
    interest we have seen from governments and industries across the world is very
    promising,” Barbensi says.

    reactors. “There were lots of questions,” says [Patrick Ryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-ryan-abs/),
    ABS’s senior vice president and chief technology officer. “Does the reactor eat
    up all my cargo space? How is it arranged? Where does the crew go? What are the
    special training requirements? How do I insert this technology? How do I refuel?
    Does it change how fast I go? We needed to get the conversation started.”

    reactors on ships is the best way to go about it. In the near term, they argue,
    it makes more sense to use nuclear power as a source of electricity to produce
    alternative low-carbon fuels. “If you use [nuclear electricity to electrolyze](https://fathom.world/should-we-use-nuclear-power-to-make-hydrogen-fuels-for-shipping/)

    “There are technology risks, but as far as molten-salt fast reactors go, everyone
    agrees there are no showstoppers,” he insists. He adds that SMRs for marine deployment
    would be built in factories and assembled at shipyards, speeding up construction
    and lowering cost. Land-based nuclear power plants, for comparison, are constructed
    on site and typically far exceed their budgets and schedules. Cost also played
    a big role in NuScale Power Corp.’s plan to [end its attempt](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/uamps-and-nuscale-power-agree-to-terminate-the-carbon-free-power-project)

- en: Gennaro admits that the perception that nuclear reactors are unsafe will be
    a problem, but he sees it as a challenge that can be overcome. Ryan points out
    that traditional fossil fuels also carry risks, which is why the ABS creates rules
    and guidance on how to use those fuels safely. Regulatory agencies would similarly
    have to devise rules for new propulsion methods. Ammonia, for instance, is very
    toxic, so a fuel spill would have a different level of concern than fossil fuels,
    he says. Nuclear reactors for U.S. commercial ships would not only have oversight
    from the ABS but would also require licensing from the U.S. [Nuclear Regulatory
    Commission](https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc.html).

    existing ships could be retrofitted by replacing diesel engines with the SMRs,

    cable, maintenance ships, and fishing vessels—are ideal candidates for nuclear
    propulsion, he says. “They need high amounts of power for operation and have to
    be at sea for months at a time. It would be a big advantage if they don’t have
