    preserving Einstein’s classical concept of spacetime is announced today in two
    papers published simultaneously by UCL (University College London) physicists.

    which governs the smallest particles in the universe, and Einstein’s theory of
    general relativity on the other, which explains gravity through the bending of
    spacetime. But these two theories are in contradiction with each other and a reconciliation
    has remained elusive for over a century.'

    modified, or “quantised”, in order to fit within quantum theory. This is the approach
    of two leading candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, string theory and loop
    quantum gravity.

    and laid out in a new paper in Physical Review X (PRX), challenges that consensus
    and takes an alternative approach by suggesting that spacetime may be classical
    – that is, not governed by quantum theory at all.

- en: Instead of modifying spacetime, the theory – dubbed a “postquantum theory of
    classical gravity” – modifies quantum theory and predicts an intrinsic breakdown
    in predictability that is mediated by spacetime itself. This results in random
    and violent fluctuations in spacetime that are larger than envisaged under quantum
    theory, rendering the apparent weight of objects unpredictable if measured precisely
    enough.

    weigh a 1kg mass which used to be the 1kg standard. If the fluctuations in measurements
    of this 1kg mass are smaller than required for mathematical consistency, the theory
    can be ruled out.

    the quantum vs classical nature of spacetime, is the subject of a 5000:1 odds

    relativity are mathematically incompatible with each other, so it’s important
    to understand how this contradiction is resolved. Should spacetime be quantised,

    violent and random fluctuations all around us, but on a scale which we haven’t

    “measurement postulate” of quantum theory is not needed, since quantum superpositions
    necessarily localise through their interaction with classical spacetime.

    hole information problem. According to standard quantum theory, an object going
    into a black hole should be radiated back out in some way as information cannot
    be destroyed, but this violates general relativity, which says you can never know
    about objects that cross the black hole’s event horizon. The new theory allows
    for information to be destroyed, due to a fundamental breakdown in predictability.

    uncertainty principle, and we can never know their position or velocity at the
    same time. In fact, they don’t even have a definite position or velocity until
    we measure them. Particles like electrons can behave more like waves and act almost
    as if they can be in many places at once (more precisely, physicists describe

    computer chips, to lasers, to superconductivity to radioactive decay. In contrast,
    we say that a system behaves classically if it has definite underlying properties.
    A cat appears to behave classically – it is either dead or alive, not both, nor
    in a superposition of being dead and alive. Why do cats behave classically, and
    small particles quantumly? We don’t know, but the postquantum theory doesn’t require
    the measurement postulate, because the classicality of spacetime infects quantum
    systems and causes them to localise.

    theory of general relativity (GR), which holds that gravity is not a force in
    the usual sense. Instead, heavy objects such as the sun, bend the fabric of spacetime
    in such a way that causes the earth to revolve around it. Spacetime is just a
    mathematical object consisting of the three dimensions of space, and time considered
    as a fourth dimension. General relativity predicted the formation of black holes
    and the big bang. It holds that time flows at different rates at different points
    in space, and the GPS in your smartphone needs to account for this in order to
    properly determine your location.'

- en: '**Historical context**: The framework presented by Oppenheim in PRX, and in
    a companion paper with Sparaciari, Šoda and Weller-Davies, derives the most general
    consistent form of dynamics in which a quantum system interacts with a classical
    system. It then applies this framework to the case of general relativity coupled
    to quantum fields theory. It builds on earlier work and a community of physicists.
    An experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity via gravitationally mediated
    entanglement was proposed by Bose et. al. and by C. Marletto and V. Vadral. Two
    examples of consistent classical-quantum dynamics were discovered in the 90’s
    by Ph. Blanchard and A. Jadzyk, and by Lajos Diosi, and again by David Poulin
    around 2017\. From a different perspective, in 2014 a model of Newtonian gravity
    coupled to quantum systems via a “measurement-and-feedback” approach, was presented
    by Diosi and Antoinne Tilloy in 2016, and by D Kafri, J. Taylor, and G. Milburn,
    in 2014\. The idea that gravity might be somehow related to the collapse of the
    wavefunction, dates back to F. Karolyhazy (1966), L. Diosi (1987) and R. Penrose
    (1996). That classical-quantum couplings might explain localistation of the wavefunction
    has been suggested by others including M. Hall and M. Reginatto, Diosi and Tilloy,
    and David Poulin. The idea that spacetime might be classical dates back to I.
    Sato (1950), and C. Moller (1962), but no consistent theory was found until now.'
