    — that is a breaking change.

- en: The development team is well aware of this. SQLite users should be aware that
    when they rely on undocumented behavior, or behavior contrary to the documentation,
    they bear the risk of such changes. Nevertheless, the developers often elect to
    preserve undocumented behavior, and sometimes elect to document it so as to make
    it part of the public API.

- en: Worth noting in relation to this issue is that the JSON binary encoding feature,
    with its effect upon the JSON functions, was exposed for several weeks prior to
    the 3.45 release. The pre-release drops and announcements are intended to give
    attentive users a chance to bring out issues, such as the one instigating this
    thread, before they become less subject to remedy by altering behavior or the
    public API. After a release, behavior changes that conflict with the published
    API are much less likely to be effected.

    I would agree that labeling your complaint as "crying" would be rude, insensitive,
    and out of place in this forum. Abusive posts are often deleted or partially elided
    in moderation. We moderators try to keep discussions civil here. However, you
    were simply urged to not cry. While I saw the weak implication that you might
    do so or were doing so as a bit over the edge of clear civility, I elected to
    ignore that minor transgression -- in part because it is good advice when applied
    to the set of people who may encounter similar difficulties.^([2](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/012136abd5292b8d#footnoteP-2-a))

    who depart from it may either never see their uncivil posts or may see them deleted
    or correctively edited. Further, no appearance of uncivil remarks or phrasing
    should be considered to be encouragement of such. At most, it represents neglect
    or very limited tolerance by the moderator(s).
