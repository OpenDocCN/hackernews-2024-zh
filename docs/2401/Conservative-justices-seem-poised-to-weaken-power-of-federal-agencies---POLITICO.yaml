    solicitor general was unable to precisely explain when courts should defer to
    a federal agency’s own interpretation of laws that delegate broad authority to
    that agency.

    adopted during a legal battle between the oil industry and environmentalists over
    a Reagan-era rule. The *Chevron* doctrine holds that when a statute is ambiguous
    and a federal agency crafts a regulation based on the agency’s “reasonable” reading
    of the statute, judges must uphold the regulation.

    of agencies. Supporters also argued that Congress can’t legislate for every possibility
    and so agencies need the flexibility to act.

    agendas. Agencies fare much better under that standard than when courts review
    actions without deference, studies have found.

- en: But for more than a decade — particularly after Barack Obama used executive
    action to advance his agenda when Congress failed to pass his laws — conservative
    legal thinkers have pressed to overturn *Chevron*. It takes away from judges the
    ability to decide what the law is, a fundamental checks-and-balances violation,
    they argue.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Supreme Court itself has already distanced itself from *Chevron*. Over the
    past eight years, the high court has avoided using it to decide a case. Instead,
    the court’s strengthened conservative majority has moved toward more aggressive
    standards, including the so-called major questions doctrine, which says Congress
    must explicitly authorize actions with significant economic or political impacts.

    it the law of the land for lower courts that settle such cases routinely. In two
    cases argued Wednesday, the justices are being asked to eliminate *Chevron* entirely.

    argued that inconsistent findings of ambiguity in the lower courts are evidence
    that the high court needs to do something.

    they could reiterate that judges should more thoroughly use other tools of interpretation
    before deciding a statute is ambiguous, Prelogar argued.

    Gorsuch. He noted that the two cases pending at the Supreme Court — both of which
    concern a commercial fishing rule that requires fishermen to pay for regulatory
    monitors on their boats — led to disparate findings of ambiguity in the lower
    courts despite a relatively basic question.

    see a week in the future with respect to this subject, let alone a year or a decade

    the courts or agencies to fill those gaps, she asked Roman Martinez, an attorney
    at Latham & Watkins who represents fishermen challenging *Chevron*.

    a sign she may be leaning in that direction. Barrett asked if it would lead to

    go back to court for a more favorable re-do.

    he wrote using *Chevron* deference to sustain the FCC’s regulation of internet
    providers. Thomas [publicly repudiated](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-402_o75p.pdf)
