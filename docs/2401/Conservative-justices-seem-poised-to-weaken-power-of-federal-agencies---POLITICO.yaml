    adopted during a legal battle between the oil industry and environmentalists over
    a Reagan-era rule. The *Chevron* doctrine holds that when a statute is ambiguous
    and a federal agency crafts a regulation based on the agency’s “reasonable” reading
    of the statute, judges must uphold the regulation.

    action to advance his agenda when Congress failed to pass his laws — conservative
    legal thinkers have pressed to overturn *Chevron*. It takes away from judges the
    ability to decide what the law is, a fundamental checks-and-balances violation,
    they argue.

    past eight years, the high court has avoided using it to decide a case. Instead,
    the court’s strengthened conservative majority has moved toward more aggressive
    standards, including the so-called major questions doctrine, which says Congress
    must explicitly authorize actions with significant economic or political impacts.

    monitors on their boats — led to disparate findings of ambiguity in the lower
    courts despite a relatively basic question.
