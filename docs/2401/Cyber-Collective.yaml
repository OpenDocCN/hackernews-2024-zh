- en: You probably don't think much about data brokers, but these behind-the-scenes
    companies collect, trade, and profit from our personal information every day.
    Data brokers like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax gather data about us from public
    records, online activities, store loyalty programs, and more. This data gets packaged
    into profiles and sold to other businesses for targeted advertising, credit checks,
    background screening, and who knows what else.

- en: All this happens without our knowledge or consent. Most people have no idea
    the extent of their digital footprint or how to even access the data collected
    about them. While we willingly give away some personal information to use online
    services, plenty is taken without our permission.

    via email or letter. Clearly state your name, address, relevant account numbers,
    and that you want your data deleted. Keep records of all requests.

    consumer pressure demand change. But we can fight back by actively managing our
    digital footprints and being conscious about what we are consenting to online.
