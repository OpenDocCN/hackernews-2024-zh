- en: The Microsoft security team detected a nation-state attack on our corporate
    systems on January 12, 2024, and immediately activated our response process to
    investigate, disrupt malicious activity, mitigate the attack, and deny the threat
    actor further access. Microsoft has identified the threat actor as [Midnight Blizzard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/tag/midnight-blizzard-nobelium/),
    the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as Nobelium. As part of our ongoing
    commitment to responsible transparency as recently affirmed in our [Secure Future
    Initiative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/)
    (SFI), we are sharing this update.

- en: Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray attack
    to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and gain a foothold,
    and then used the account’s permissions to access a very small percentage of Microsoft
    corporate email accounts, including members of our senior leadership team and
    employees in our cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some
    emails and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially
    targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself.
    We are in the process of notifying employees whose email was accessed.

    To date, there is no evidence that the threat actor had any access to customer
    environments, production systems, source code, or AI systems. We will notify customers
    if any action is required.

    well-resourced nation-state threat actors like [Midnight Blizzard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/tag/midnight-blizzard-nobelium/).

    (SFI), given the reality of threat actors that are resourced and funded by nation
    states, we are shifting the balance we need to strike between security and business
    risk – the traditional sort of calculus is simply no longer sufficient. For Microsoft,
    this incident has highlighted the urgent need to move even faster. We will act
    immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned legacy
    systems and internal business processes, even when these changes might cause disruption
    to existing business processes.

    but this is a necessary step, and only the first of several we will be taking
    to embrace this philosophy.

- en: We are continuing our investigation and will take additional actions based on
    the outcomes of this investigation and will continue working with law enforcement
    and appropriate regulators. We are deeply committed to sharing more information
    and our learnings, so that the community can benefit from both our experience
    and observations about the threat actor. We will provide additional details as
    appropriate.
