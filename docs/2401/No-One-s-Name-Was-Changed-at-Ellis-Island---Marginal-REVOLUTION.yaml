    down wrong” at Ellis Island or any American port. *That idea is an urban legend*.

- en: Many names did get changed as immigrants settled into their new American lives,
    but those changes were made several years after arrival and were done by choice
    of someone in the family. The belief persists, however, that the changes were
    done at the entry point and that the immigrants were unwilling participants in
    the modifications. Sophisticated family history researchers have long rolled their
    collective eyes at the “Ellis Island name change” idea. In genealogy blogs and
    online publications, they wearily repeat the correction—names were not changed
    at Ellis Island; immigrants changed their own names, usually during the citizenship
    process. But the belief persists, perhaps because people need to explain surname
    changes in a way that satisfies them (thinking that their immigrant ancestors
    made the changes themselves apparently does not do so).

    were paying passengers, not cattle. They weren’t shoved onto ships and then dumped
    onto American shores to be newly cataloged by harried immigration officials. The
    shipping companies were running a business, much as airlines do today—they sold
    tickets to people who could afford to purchase them (even a steerage class ticket
    cost almost a thousand dollars in today’s currency)….Agents quoted ticket prices
    to the would-be traveler, accepted payment, and then recorded each traveler’s
    name and other identifying information (the specific information collected varied
    over the years). The information taken down by the agents was sent to the home
    office, where it was transferred by shipping company clerks onto large blank sheets
    provided by the US government. Those sheets became the passenger lists which later
    were used by American port officials.

    was complete, it was turned over to the ship’s captain. On departure day, crew
    members checked people’s names against the list as they came on board. The crew
    allowed past them only those people whose names were on the list, i.e., those
    who had paid for a ticket….Captains were required by the 1819 Steerage Act to
    sign a statement printed on the manifest verifying that the names on each list
    matched the names of those people disembarking. Any discrepancies resulted in
    fines for the shipping company. Thus it was in the shipping company’s interest
    to make sure no one stepped onto American soil whose name was not already on a
    manifest.

    and delivered it to the chief immigration official. That official checked it and
    then gave the manifest to officers called registry clerks who questioned each
    traveler and verified the information recorded on the lists…Obviously then, despite
    what the *Godfather* film conveys, the officials at Ellis Island did not record
    travelers’ names—they had pages with the names *already filled in*. The task of
    the registry clerks was to do the same thing the ship’s crew had done: check each
    person’s stated name against the name recorded on the manifest.'

    an immigrant’s name because it was too difficult to spell or sounded too foreign.
    On a side note, the belief that immigration officials changed names to make them
    less “foreign” presumes that the Ellis Island officials were of different ethnicities
    than the immigrants and were openly hostile to them. In fact, officials were often
    hired *because* they spoke multiple languages.

- en: From an [excellent debunking](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/dttp/article/view/6655/8939)
    by Rosemary Meszaros and Katherine Pennavaria. Many people will continue to deny
    the obvious but if you still have doubts you can find the original manifests through
    the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/). The urban legend that names
    were changed at Ellis Island comes from a scene in the Godfather movie and perhaps
    because people with Americanized names today like to think that someone other
    than their ancestor changed their name.
