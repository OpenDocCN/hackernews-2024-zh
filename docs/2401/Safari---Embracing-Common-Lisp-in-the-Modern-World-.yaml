    it’s crucial to understand the foundations that continue to influence our tech
    choices. This presentation not only reveals how Clojure is deeply rooted in Common
    Lisp but also explores the grand vision of the JVM as a universal computing platform.
    It paints a vivid picture of how the tech landscape has transformed since the
    late ’90s, offering a compelling comparison between then and now. Additionally,
    it dives into the efficiency and performance disparities between Common Lisp and
    Clojure, providing valuable insights for developers navigating the complex realm
    of programming languages.

    we use. By embracing Common Lisp over Clojure and the JVM, we’re not only choosing
    a powerful programming language but also making a greener choice for the environment.
    In a world where sustainability matters more than ever, our programming decisions
    can play a significant role. Join us in uncovering the enduring legacy of Common
    Lisp and its relevance in the ever-evolving modern tech world while making a conscious
    choice for a greener future.
