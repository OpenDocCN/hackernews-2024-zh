- en: When I was about maybe 14 years old, I plotted to have a fun night by myself
    in my family home, on a day that I knew everyone was going to be home late. I
    had borrowed a DVD from a friend, a live concert of one of my favorite bands,
    Mr. Big – I believe it was the Farewell Live in Japan 2002 video. I decided to
    really treat myself, and I bought three 3-packs of Kinder Bueno chocolates, which
    adds up to… 18 sticks of creamy, hazelnutty chocolate wafers.

  zh: 大概我14岁左右时，我打算在自己家里度过一个愉快的晚上，我知道家里所有人都会很晚才回来。我从朋友那里借了一张DVD，是我最喜欢的乐队之一Mr. Big的现场演唱会——我想是Farewell
    Live in Japan 2002录像。我决定好好对待自己，然后我买了三份三包装儿童好时巧克力，总共有……18条充满奶油和榛子口味的巧克力薄饼。
- en: Since nobody was home, I got to turn up the volume louder than I’d normally
    dare to play anything. I marvelled at the tremendous spectacle of HD quality footage
    of Billie Sheehan and Ritchie Kotzen trading virtuostic riffs, and I ate those
    chocolates until I felt sick. To this day, when I eat Kinder Bueno, I think somewhat
    fondly back to that day. I’ve tweeted about this anecdote at least twice over
    the years, and I’m writing about it again, which tells me there’s something in
    here that I probably want to dig into and examine.

- en: I find myself thinking of days spent at LAN shop with friends. Do kids these
    days know what LAN shops are? I’ll describe them anyway. They were a rather specialized
    form of internet cafe, venues with rows upon rows of computers, and you could
    book computers by the hour. I remember how a friend brought me to play Counter-Strike
    for the first time, and how I had no idea what I was doing and would simply get
    killed over and over again… and yet I found it compelling somehow, and was determined
    to get better at it. I remember when the original DOTA craze swept through my
    secondary school, and guys who were particularly good at were respected for their
    skills. I remember when Left 4 Dead came out, and my friends and I relished the
    opportunity to complete the campaigns together at increasing difficulties. We’d
    play a round, then step outside for a cigarette break and discuss what went down.
    We did a similar thing playing 5 v 5 DOTA against the hardest difficulty AI bots.
    Sometimes we’d lose several rounds for hours before finally securing a glorious,
    deeply gratifying victory. Those were some of my happiest and most satisfying
    moments from those years of my life, definitely much more than my experience of
    school.

  zh: 我发现自己总是回忆起和朋友一起在网咖度过的日子。这些如今的孩子们是否知道什么是网咖？不管怎样，我来描述一下。它们是一种非常专门的网吧形式，那里摆满了一排排的电脑，你可以按小时预定电脑。我记得朋友带我第一次玩《反恐精英》时，我根本不知道自己在做什么，总是一次又一次地被击败……但不知何故，我却觉得这令人着迷，并决心要变得更好。我记得当初就读中学时，《DOTA》风靡一时，擅长这款游戏的家伙受到了尊重。我还记得当《生化危机4》发布时，我和朋友们都很享受一起在不断升级难度的战役中一起玩耍。我们会玩一局，然后出去抽根烟，讨论发生了什么。我们还会组队对抗最难AI难度的《DOTA》，有时候我们会连续几个小时输掉几局，最终才获得了一场辉煌而深刻的胜利。这些都是我生命中那些年里最快乐和令我满足的时刻，绝对比我的学校体验要丰富多彩得多。
- en: I could also talk at length about my enjoyment of live music, playing instruments,
    playing in bands, going to shows, chatting on the local music forum, all that
    stuff. I wrote the draft of an entire novel about this, and maybe it’s time I
    revisit it. Or maybe I could publish it in a sort of serialized way. But I digress.
    This is shaping up to be a post about enjoyment, about pleasure. “Are you having
    fun, son?” I’m struck by how rarely anybody asked me that question. It wasn’t
    something that my social reality cared about. But it’s something that I felt was
    implicitly a powerful theme in the media that resonated with me. [Calvin and Hobbes
    was about having fun](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1510429955712200705).
    Horrible Histories was about having fun. Some deep part of me knew that fun was
    important – axiomatically, incontrovertibly so – and I’m really grateful that
    I’ve somehow been able to keep those embers alive all the way through adulthood,
    particularly growing up in a culture that discouraged it. I’m now reminded of
    how I once wrote up a partial draft of my life’s memoirs, and I titled it *Naughty
    Boy* – because I would so often be called that, even though I was always friendly,
    polite and cheerful. A kid exercising autonomy and [earnestly pursuing his own
    interests](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/nothing-is-edgier-than-earnestness)
    was a naughty kid, because his casual existence was a violation of the prevailing
    social order.

    video games, watching television. The sheer rush of say, hearing the theme song
    of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as a kid on a Saturday morning, is something that’s
    hard to match as an adult. (Why DID all those 90s kids cartoons and tv shows have

- en: As I got older, fun got more complicated. I specifically remember hearing things
    from adults like, “you should work hard in your youth, make sacrifices now, and
    then you can have fun later in life.” I always thought that was a grotesque line
    of thinking, and I remember thinking about kids who died untimely deaths who never
    got to have much fun, and adults who spent decades of their lives working jobs
    they hated who seemed absolutely miserable despite their fancy cars.

  zh: 随着我长大，玩乐变得更加复杂。我特别记得从成年人那里听到过的话，比如，“你应该在年轻时努力工作，现在做出牺牲，然后你就可以在以后的生活中玩乐。”我一直认为那是一种丑陋的思维方式，我记得想到过那些过早去世的孩子，他们从未有过太多的乐趣，以及那些花了几十年时间从事他们讨厌的工作的成年人，尽管他们有豪华的汽车，但似乎绝对不快乐。
- en: Also, the adults who said that shit never really seemed all that happy themselves.
    I think that was the real crux of it. They all seemed frustrated. I think if I
    met some truly happy adults who said that, I would’ve taken that message more
    seriously. But when I looked around – and I had to look far beyond my immediate
    social environment – it seemed like the happiest adults were those who had kept
    having at least some fun throughout their lives. They kept their spirit intact.
    As Al Pacino’s character said in *Scent of a Woman*, there’s no prosthetic for
    an amputated soul. That sort of thing always resonated very deeply with me. I
    desperately wanted to keep my soul intact, whatever it was. That meant I had to
    have fun, I had to keep a sense of child-like joy and wonder with me throughout.
    And I believe I have done that. And I don’t spend nearly enough time really expressing
    gratitude to my past selves for protecting that animating spirit, despite everyone
    telling me I was naive, irresponsible and so on.

  zh: 此外，那些说这种话的成年人似乎从来没有真正快乐过。我认为这才是问题的关键所在。他们似乎都很沮丧。我想，如果我遇到一些真正快乐的成年人说过这样的话，我会更认真地对待这个信息。但是当我四处张望时——我不得不远远超出了我当前的社交环境——看起来最快乐的成年人是那些在整个生命中都保持了至少一些乐趣的人。他们保持了他们的精神完整。正如阿尔·帕西诺的角色在《热情的一夜》中所说的那样，没有关于截肢灵魂的义肢。这种东西总是深深地
    resonated 在我心中。我非常渴望保持我的灵魂完整，不管它是什么。这意味着我必须玩得开心，我必须在整个过程中保持一种孩子般的快乐和惊奇。我相信我已经做到了。我没有花足够的时间真正感恩我的过去自己，因为每个人都告诉我我是天真的，不负责任的等等。
- en: What else is there to say about the matter of fun? I’m already sensing that
    I’ve skimmed past a couple of salient [branching paths](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/branching-paths).
    One of the things I wanted to note was how… ham-fisted? my approach was, regarding
    the excessive chocolate. I had this child’s understanding of, “if some chocolate
    is good, surely more chocolate is better!” And it turns out of course that the
    dose maketh the poison, and too much of any good thing ceases to be very good.

    结果当然是剂量产生毒药，任何好东西过量都不再好了。
- en: I’d like to spend more time and energy really getting good at understanding
    what makes something fun, or more precisely, how to create substantially fun experiences.
    This ties up so much with everything. I find writing good tweets much easier than
    writing good essays, and writing a good book is much harder still. It seems true
    that the “bigger” or “longer” an experience is, the more thoughtful you have to
    be to make it good, because you have to account for more variables, more concerns.
    There are some parallels here with how a coffee date is easier than dinner, and
    how a summer vacation fling is easier than a happy marriage of decades.

  zh: 我想花更多的时间和精力真正擅长理解什么让事情变得有趣，或者更准确地说，如何创造出极具乐趣的体验。这与一切都紧密联系在一起。我发现写好推文比写好论文容易得多，而写一本好书则更难。似乎“体验”越“大”或者“长”，你就必须越深思熟虑才能让它变得好，因为你必须考虑更多的变量，更多的问题。这里有一些与咖啡约会比晚餐容易的类似之处，以及夏季度假风流情更容易比几十年的幸福婚姻。

    this question with regards to my writing, that I neglected to do much writing
    in the process. I thought, without articulating it clearly to myself, “well, I’ve
    spent years of my life writing copious amounts, so surely I can afford to spend
    some time thinking about writing, putting off the writing until I make some sort
    of breakthrough in my thinking-about-writing.” Big mistake! I now know from experience

- en: I have more to say about everything. The school vs gaming meme, I think is super
    compelling and revealing and I’d like to think really long and hard about how
    popular gaming is with young boys all over the world, and how quick mainstream
    society has been to dismiss that as frivolous-at-best and soul-destroying at worst.
    I won’t pretend that it can’t be bad, I’ve personally seen friends go deep into
    the abyss of gaming-induced hell. But if you ask me, it’s never really the games
    themselves that are the root of the problem. The deeper issue is almost always
    that the person had a gaping hole in their lives that gaming filled. That’s an
    important difference. I think many addictions are like this. (Consider the [rat
    park experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park), where rats in healthy
    social environments were found to consume less morphine than rats in isolated
    cages.)

  zh: 我对一切都有更多的想法。学校与游戏的对比，我觉得非常引人入胜并且揭示性，我想深入思考世界各地年轻男孩为何如此喜欢游戏，以及主流社会为何如此迅速地将其视为至多是轻浮的，至少是摧毁灵魂的。我不会假装它不能变糟，我亲眼看到朋友们深陷游戏诱发的地狱深渊。但如果你问我，问题的根源几乎从来都不是游戏本身。更深层次的问题几乎总是这个人生活中有一个巨大的空洞被游戏填补了。这是一个重要的区别。我认为许多瘾都是这样的。（考虑一下[老鼠乐园实验](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park)，在健康社交环境中的老鼠发现比处于孤立笼中的老鼠消耗更少的吗啡。）
- en: But really at the heart of everything I think is that I’d like to have more
    fun myself, and get better at having fun, and have more nuanced and textured sorts
    of fun than ever before. As I said, I was told as a child that “if you work really
    hard now then you can have fun later”. Well, I did work really hard throughout
    my twenties, in my own way, at my own thing. I used to write prodigiously on all
    my commutes to and from work, so that I would get good enough at writing to someday
    be able to do it for a living. And I spent years [solving for distribution](https://visakanv.com/marketing/solve-for-distribution/),
    talking to as many people as I could, so that there would be a market for said
    writing. So in a sense, I’ve “succeeded”. I’m living my childhood dream. Which

- en: So yeah, maybe there’s no fun that’s both simple and eternal. To continue to
    have fun is to participate in a dynamic process, to adapt to the situation. To
    keep having fun means you have to recognize when you’ve had enough chocolate,
    or you’ve been playing for enough hours, or when it’s time to write the last sentence
    on a particular essay and hit publish. ;-)
