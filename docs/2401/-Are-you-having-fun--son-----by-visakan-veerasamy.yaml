- en: When I was about maybe 14 years old, I plotted to have a fun night by myself
    in my family home, on a day that I knew everyone was going to be home late. I
    had borrowed a DVD from a friend, a live concert of one of my favorite bands,
    Mr. Big – I believe it was the Farewell Live in Japan 2002 video. I decided to
    really treat myself, and I bought three 3-packs of Kinder Bueno chocolates, which
    adds up to… 18 sticks of creamy, hazelnutty chocolate wafers.

    dare to play anything. I marvelled at the tremendous spectacle of HD quality footage
    of Billie Sheehan and Ritchie Kotzen trading virtuostic riffs, and I ate those
    chocolates until I felt sick. To this day, when I eat Kinder Bueno, I think somewhat
    fondly back to that day. I’ve tweeted about this anecdote at least twice over
    the years, and I’m writing about it again, which tells me there’s something in
    here that I probably want to dig into and examine.

    rare event that was, that I set aside a significant amount of time for pure pleasure,
    and had a plan for what I was going to do with it. I find myself wondering what
    other moments fit this description.

    days know what LAN shops are? I’ll describe them anyway. They were a rather specialized
    form of internet cafe, venues with rows upon rows of computers, and you could
    book computers by the hour. I remember how a friend brought me to play Counter-Strike
    for the first time, and how I had no idea what I was doing and would simply get
    killed over and over again… and yet I found it compelling somehow, and was determined
    to get better at it. I remember when the original DOTA craze swept through my
    secondary school, and guys who were particularly good at were respected for their
    skills. I remember when Left 4 Dead came out, and my friends and I relished the
    opportunity to complete the campaigns together at increasing difficulties. We’d
    play a round, then step outside for a cigarette break and discuss what went down.
    We did a similar thing playing 5 v 5 DOTA against the hardest difficulty AI bots.
    Sometimes we’d lose several rounds for hours before finally securing a glorious,
    deeply gratifying victory. Those were some of my happiest and most satisfying
    moments from those years of my life, definitely much more than my experience of
    school.

    playing in bands, going to shows, chatting on the local music forum, all that
    stuff. I wrote the draft of an entire novel about this, and maybe it’s time I
    revisit it. Or maybe I could publish it in a sort of serialized way. But I digress.
    This is shaping up to be a post about enjoyment, about pleasure. “Are you having
    fun, son?” I’m struck by how rarely anybody asked me that question. It wasn’t
    something that my social reality cared about. But it’s something that I felt was
    implicitly a powerful theme in the media that resonated with me. [Calvin and Hobbes
    was about having fun](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1510429955712200705).
    Horrible Histories was about having fun. Some deep part of me knew that fun was
    important – axiomatically, incontrovertibly so – and I’m really grateful that
    I’ve somehow been able to keep those embers alive all the way through adulthood,
    particularly growing up in a culture that discouraged it. I’m now reminded of
    how I once wrote up a partial draft of my life’s memoirs, and I titled it *Naughty
    Boy* – because I would so often be called that, even though I was always friendly,
    polite and cheerful. A kid exercising autonomy and [earnestly pursuing his own
    interests](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/nothing-is-edgier-than-earnestness)
    was a naughty kid, because his casual existence was a violation of the prevailing
    social order.

    video games, watching television. The sheer rush of say, hearing the theme song
    of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as a kid on a Saturday morning, is something that’s
    hard to match as an adult. (Why DID all those 90s kids cartoons and tv shows have

- en: As I got older, fun got more complicated. I specifically remember hearing things
    from adults like, “you should work hard in your youth, make sacrifices now, and
    then you can have fun later in life.” I always thought that was a grotesque line
    of thinking, and I remember thinking about kids who died untimely deaths who never
    got to have much fun, and adults who spent decades of their lives working jobs
    they hated who seemed absolutely miserable despite their fancy cars.

  zh: 随着我长大，玩乐变得更加复杂。我特别记得从成年人那里听到过的话，比如，“你应该在年轻时努力工作，现在做出牺牲，然后你就可以在以后的生活中玩乐。”我一直认为那是一种丑陋的思维方式，我记得想到过那些过早去世的孩子，他们从未有过太多的乐趣，以及那些花了几十年时间从事他们讨厌的工作的成年人，尽管他们有豪华的汽车，但似乎绝对不快乐。
- en: Also, the adults who said that shit never really seemed all that happy themselves.
    I think that was the real crux of it. They all seemed frustrated. I think if I
    met some truly happy adults who said that, I would’ve taken that message more
    seriously. But when I looked around – and I had to look far beyond my immediate
    social environment – it seemed like the happiest adults were those who had kept
    having at least some fun throughout their lives. They kept their spirit intact.
    As Al Pacino’s character said in *Scent of a Woman*, there’s no prosthetic for
    an amputated soul. That sort of thing always resonated very deeply with me. I
    desperately wanted to keep my soul intact, whatever it was. That meant I had to
    have fun, I had to keep a sense of child-like joy and wonder with me throughout.
    And I believe I have done that. And I don’t spend nearly enough time really expressing
    gratitude to my past selves for protecting that animating spirit, despite everyone
    telling me I was naive, irresponsible and so on.

    I’ve skimmed past a couple of salient [branching paths](https://visakanv.substack.com/p/branching-paths).
    One of the things I wanted to note was how… ham-fisted? my approach was, regarding
    the excessive chocolate. I had this child’s understanding of, “if some chocolate
    is good, surely more chocolate is better!” And it turns out of course that the
    dose maketh the poison, and too much of any good thing ceases to be very good.

- en: I’d like to spend more time and energy really getting good at understanding
    what makes something fun, or more precisely, how to create substantially fun experiences.
    This ties up so much with everything. I find writing good tweets much easier than
    writing good essays, and writing a good book is much harder still. It seems true
    that the “bigger” or “longer” an experience is, the more thoughtful you have to
    be to make it good, because you have to account for more variables, more concerns.
    There are some parallels here with how a coffee date is easier than dinner, and
    how a summer vacation fling is easier than a happy marriage of decades.

    this question with regards to my writing, that I neglected to do much writing
    in the process. I thought, without articulating it clearly to myself, “well, I’ve
    spent years of my life writing copious amounts, so surely I can afford to spend
    some time thinking about writing, putting off the writing until I make some sort
    of breakthrough in my thinking-about-writing.” Big mistake! I now know from experience

    really do that for longer than maybe a week before things start to get bad. Hey,

- en: I have more to say about everything. The school vs gaming meme, I think is super
    compelling and revealing and I’d like to think really long and hard about how
    popular gaming is with young boys all over the world, and how quick mainstream
    society has been to dismiss that as frivolous-at-best and soul-destroying at worst.
    I won’t pretend that it can’t be bad, I’ve personally seen friends go deep into
    the abyss of gaming-induced hell. But if you ask me, it’s never really the games
    themselves that are the root of the problem. The deeper issue is almost always
    that the person had a gaping hole in their lives that gaming filled. That’s an
    important difference. I think many addictions are like this. (Consider the [rat
    park experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park), where rats in healthy
    social environments were found to consume less morphine than rats in isolated
    cages.)

  zh: 我对一切都有更多的想法。学校与游戏的对比，我觉得非常引人入胜并且揭示性，我想深入思考世界各地年轻男孩为何如此喜欢游戏，以及主流社会为何如此迅速地将其视为至多是轻浮的，至少是摧毁灵魂的。我不会假装它不能变糟，我亲眼看到朋友们深陷游戏诱发的地狱深渊。但如果你问我，问题的根源几乎从来都不是游戏本身。更深层次的问题几乎总是这个人生活中有一个巨大的空洞被游戏填补了。这是一个重要的区别。我认为许多瘾都是这样的。（考虑一下[老鼠乐园实验](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park)，在健康社交环境中的老鼠发现比处于孤立笼中的老鼠消耗更少的吗啡。）
- en: But really at the heart of everything I think is that I’d like to have more
    fun myself, and get better at having fun, and have more nuanced and textured sorts
    of fun than ever before. As I said, I was told as a child that “if you work really
    hard now then you can have fun later”. Well, I did work really hard throughout
    my twenties, in my own way, at my own thing. I used to write prodigiously on all
    my commutes to and from work, so that I would get good enough at writing to someday
    be able to do it for a living. And I spent years [solving for distribution](https://visakanv.com/marketing/solve-for-distribution/),
    talking to as many people as I could, so that there would be a market for said
    writing. So in a sense, I’ve “succeeded”. I’m living my childhood dream. Which
    is resplendent and beatific for a while, but then you acclimate to it, and then
    you have to ask, what next?

  zh: 但实际上我认为一切的核心是，我想自己更多地享受乐趣，变得更擅长于享受乐趣，比以往任何时候都更加细腻和多样化地享受乐趣。正如我所说，我小时候被告知“如果你现在努力工作，那么以后你就能享受乐趣”。嗯，我确实在自己的方式中，在自己的事情上，在我二十多岁的时候努力工作。我曾经在上下班的所有路上写过很多东西，以便能够写得足够好以便有一天能够靠写作谋生。我花了几年的时间[解决分发问题](https://visakanv.com/marketing/solve-for-distribution/)，尽可能多地与人交谈，以便有市场来接受我的写作。所以从某种意义上说，我“成功”了。我正在过着我的童年梦想。这在一段时间内是灿烂而美好的，但是然后你适应了它，然后你不得不问，接下来呢？
- en: So yeah, maybe there’s no fun that’s both simple and eternal. To continue to
    have fun is to participate in a dynamic process, to adapt to the situation. To
    keep having fun means you have to recognize when you’ve had enough chocolate,
    or you’ve been playing for enough hours, or when it’s time to write the last sentence
    on a particular essay and hit publish. ;-)
