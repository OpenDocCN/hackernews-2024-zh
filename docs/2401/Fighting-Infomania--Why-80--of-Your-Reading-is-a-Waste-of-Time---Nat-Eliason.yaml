    doing management consulting with a government contracting firm, and in the process,
    realized that working in a company wasn’t for me.

    are talking about tactics-wise, but it’s just noise. You should have the strategy
    and tactics that you’re working on, and then you should execute on them. Constantly
    listening to and checking what other people are doing doesn’t help you stay focused–it
    just makes you question yourself.
