- en: 2023 was a great year for the Wayland driver for Wine. Our goal was to move
    forward from the experimental phase and make the driver a proper upstream component.
    A year later, after [several merge requests](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&search=winewayland),
    many people are now already able to use the [latest Wine release](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0)
    to enjoy some of their favorite Windows applications in a completely X11-free
    environment!

    the Wayland driver (which is very exciting to see), so I'll let those videos speak
    for themselves!
