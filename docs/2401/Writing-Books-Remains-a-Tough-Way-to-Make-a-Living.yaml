- en: A new author income study released by the Authors Guild provides a dizzying
    array of numbers and breakdowns about how all types of authors—traditionally published
    and self-published, full-time and part-time—fared financially in 2022\. With such
    a deep trove of statistics, the survey offers something for everyone, but the
    main takeaway is that most authors have a hard time earning a living from their
    craft.

  zh: 作者协会发布的新作者收入研究提供了大量关于各种类型作者（传统出版和自我出版、全职和兼职）在2022年财务上的情况的数字和细分。有如此深入的统计数据，该调查为每个人提供了一些内容，但主要的观点是大多数作者很难靠他们的手艺谋生。
- en: The survey, which drew responses from 5,699 published authors, found that in
    2022, their median gross pre-tax income from their books was $2,000\. When combined
    with other writing-related income, the total annual median income was $5,000\.
    The median book-related income for survey respondents in 2022 was up 9% from 2018,
    adjusted for inflation, with all the increase coming from full-time authors, whose
    income was up 20%, compared to a 4% decline for part-time authors.

  zh: 这项调查吸引了5699名已出版作者的回应，发现在2022年，他们从书籍中的中位数税前收入为$2,000。当结合其他与写作相关的收入时，总年收入中位数为$5,000。与2018年相比，考虑通货膨胀，2022年调查对象的中位数与书籍相关的收入增加了9%，所有增长都来自全职作者，其收入增长了20%，而兼职作者的收入下降了4%。
- en: 'While the combined income (book income plus other writing-related income) of
    full-time, established authors (those who had written a book in 2018 or before)
    rose 21% in 2022 (to $23,329) from 2018, the median income was still below poverty
    level. Earnings solely from book-related sources increased from $9,997 to $12,000
    in that period. The importance of nonbook writing-related income to authors cannot
    be overstated: 56% of respondents reported that such activities as journalism,
    conducting events, editing, ghostwriting, and teaching more than doubled their
    income.'

  zh: 虽然全职的、有经验的作者（那些在2018年或之前写过书的人）的总收入（书籍收入加其他与写作相关的收入）在2022年增长了21%（达到$23,329），但中位数收入仍然低于贫困水平。仅来自书籍相关来源的收入在这一时期内从$9,997增加到$12,000。非书籍写作相关收入对作者的重要性不言而喻：56%的受访者报告称，新闻报道、活动组织、编辑、代笔和教学等活动使他们的收入翻了一番还多。
- en: The report did have some good news for aspiring authors, finding that the top
    10% of established authors who participated in the survey had median book income
    of $275,000 last year. On the flip side, the bottom 50% had median book income
    of $1,300.

- en: The survey, conducted by the Codex Group, also took a close look at how traditionally
    published authors fared compared to self-published authors. Here, the report delivers
    what appears to be an important emerging trend. While in 2022, the median book-related
    income for full-time self-published authors was $10,200—much less than full-time
    traditionally published trade authors, who earned $15,000—established (five-plus
    years of publishing experience) full-time self-published authors more than doubled
    their book income in 2022 compared to 2018, to $19,000\. Over that time, established
    full-time traditionally published trade authors’ book income only rose 11%, to
    $15,000, demonstrating that experienced self-published authors are now significantly
    more effective at boosting their earnings than their experienced traditionally
    published counterparts.

  zh: 这项由Codex Group进行的调查还仔细研究了传统出版作者与自我出版作者的表现。在这里，报告提供了一个似乎是一个重要的新趋势。虽然在2022年，全职自我出版作者的中位数与书籍相关的收入为$10,200，远远低于全职传统出版贸易作者的$15,000，但在自我出版五年以上（出版经验）的成熟作者在2022年的书籍收入与2018年相比翻了一番，达到了$19,000。在此期间，传统出版贸易作者的成熟全职作者的书籍收入仅增长了11%，达到了$15,000，表明有经验的自我出版作者现在比有经验的传统出版作者更有效地增加了他们的收入。
- en: The survey suggests, however, that publishers may be paying more attention to
    the threat from self-publishing. Newer full-time traditionally published authors
    (those who published their first book in 2019 or later) saw their income rise
    in 2022 to $18,000, compared to $15,000 for their established counterparts. Publishers
    have plenty of incentive to lure self-published authors. The survey found that
    the overwhelming majority of authors under 55 years old earned the majority of
    their book income by self-publishing. Even among authors 65 and older (which comprised
    the largest reporting demographic), 41% reported earning the majority of income
    from self-publishing.

  zh: 然而，调查表明出版商可能更加关注自助出版的威胁。较新的全职传统出版作者（即2019年或之后出版第一本书的作者）在2022年看到他们的收入上升至18000美元，而已建立的同行为15000美元。出版商有足够的动力吸引自助出版作者。调查发现，绝大多数55岁以下的作者通过自助出版赚取了大部分书籍收入。即使在65岁及以上的作者中（这是最大的报告人口统计），41%的人报告称他们的大部分收入来自自助出版。

    contracts, copyright, freedom of expression, and livable incomes for creators.”

    她补充说，调查结果表明，“50%的全职作者仍然在许多州的收入低于最低工资标准”，并且协会无法接受一个黑人作者的收入远远低于白人作者的现状。

    like exploitative AI, unconscionable contracts, and book bans are applying new
    pressure on authors’ livelihoods, Rasenberger said. “Lawmakers, publishers, and
    the public must recognize authors as professionals deserving fair pay and dignity.
    We urge collective action to build a system that properly values the essential
    contributions of writers to society. The Authors Guild will continue this fight
    until the stark income disparities revealed in our survey are remedied by overdue
