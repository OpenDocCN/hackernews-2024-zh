    a Federal Court judge has denied a Chinese resident permission to enter Canada,
    arguing the engineering student could be pressured by Beijing into spying.

    of Waterloo and take his knowledge back to China to improve its public health
    system. Federal Court Chief Justice Paul Crampton ruled Li's proposal falls under
    the definition of "non-traditional" espionage.
