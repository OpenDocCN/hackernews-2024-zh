- en: Google appears to be readying a version of its popular Chrome browser for Windows
    on Arm. X (formerly Twitter) user [Pedro Justo](https://twitter.com/itanium_guy/status/1750686687020417237)
    spotted a native version of the browser for Windows 11 Arm-powered devices in
    the latest nightly builds of Chrome in the [Canary channel](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fchrome%2Fcanary%2F).

- en: Google’s release of a Chrome Canary version for Windows on Arm is a surprise,
    and we’ve reached out to the company to clarify when it plans to bring this to
    the stable channel. I have installed and tested the Canary version to verify it’s
    an ARM64 version.

- en: While Microsoft has long supported an Arm version of its Edge browser, also
    based on Chromium, Google has showed no sign of supporting Windows on Arm until
    this week. That’s left Windows devices running on Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon
    chips having to run Chrome in an emulated state, with slow performance.

- en: The difference between the Edge ARM64 version and the regular x86 version of
    Chrome running on a Windows on Arm device is significant. Native versions of Edge
    on Arm devices feel just like any other Intel machine, but the slowdowns and performance
    issues in Chrome on Windows on Arm are noticeable.

- en: Google has long supported Arm processors with its Chromebooks, offering a version
    of ChromeOS that’s optimized for Qualcomm’s chips. Microsoft was able to ship
    its own ARM64 version of Edge as the software maker used the basics of Chromium
    to build a new browser without Google’s Widevine digital rights management (DRM)
    system. Other browser vendors, that also use Chromium, [have stuck with Google’s
    DRM](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-holding-back-native-browsers-windows-on-arm/)
    so the choice of a native Arm browser on Windows is effectively just Edge.

    Microsoft and Qualcomm are both preparing for the next major push of Windows on
    Arm, thanks to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite processors. Qualcomm claims its
    latest chips will beat Apple, Intel, and AMD, all while recent reports suggest
    both [Nvidia and AMD plan to launch Arm PC chips](/2023/10/23/23929240/nvidia-amd-cpu-arm-pc-chips-2025-release-rumors) as
    soon as 2025\. Having Google join that effort could be significant for the future
    of Windows on Arm.
