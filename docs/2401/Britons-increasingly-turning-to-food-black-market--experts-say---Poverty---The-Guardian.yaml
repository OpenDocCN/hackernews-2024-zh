    £1bn this year, according to the British Retail Consortium’s estimate. Home Office

    it’s stolen?’ And that’s much more palatable for somebody than knowing full well
    themselves that they did steal something. So that’s where I think the cost of
    living crisis is creating the demand for stolen goods.”
