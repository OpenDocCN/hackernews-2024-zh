    coach, I observed a few things in the past month that confirmed ***you should
    be very cautious when negotiating***, especially in the brutal job market we have
    today.

    who gave me permission to share his story). Bob’s a software engineer with 10+
    years of experience in various tech companies. He recently got laid off and has
    been interviewing the past few months. He finally received an offer from another
    company, but it was a bit below what he made previously, so he asked for slightly
    more. Nothing wrong with that, right? Unfortunately, the next day the company
    rescinded his offer. Yes, rescinded as in removed him from consideration. Not
    a polite “We can’t go higher” or “Unfortunately, that’s our final offer” but a
    straight up Goodbye!'

    I discovered that this isn’t just a one-off. It’s happening more often these days.***Companies
    are rescinding offers if you try to negotiate too hard*.** The reasons vary from
    “having plenty of other candidates to choose from” to “they were happy with the
    salary range we told them in the beginning of the process” to “the candidate showed
    they wouldn’t be happy with the initial offer, so they rejected themselves!”.

    some in a Big Tech company, but unless you truly have some hard to find skill
    (ie. [you can throw 100 mph fastballs and hit homeruns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani)),
    there’s probably a lot of other candidates applying for the same job. And if recruiters
    detect the slightest bit of resistance from you, guess what? They can simply choose
    someone else. So if you truly need the job to pay your bills, don’t negotiate.
    Just take the offer.

    to a job than just the money. It could come with good perks (like the ability
    to work remotely more often), better work-life balance, or even a better learning
    experience. So even if an offer is a tad below what you’re expecting, if the other
    aspects of the job make up for it, consider not negotiating.

    to the salary range given in the beginning, then changing their mind at the end.
    It feels insulting and almost like a bait and switch. If you’re unhappy with the
    range given in the beginning, just be honest and tell them you were expecting
    higher. Don’t wait until the very end. It’s a waste of everyone’s time: the company
    and yours.'

    if you have multiple counter-offers, you should stop reading this article because
    99% of this advice does not apply to you). If you have a counter-offer, you simply
    have much more leverage and a “valid” reason for asking for more money. And if
    they dismiss you, you can just choose the higher offer instead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other exception is if you learned significant new information during the
    interview that makes you think the salary should be higher. For example, if the
    job description was originally for a senior software engineer, but you discovered
    you actually would be managing 3-4 other developers too, and the salary range
    given didn’t reflect that, it’s valid to ask for more afterwards (as long as you
    communicate that kindly and clearly)

    of presuming any casual reply will kick off a back and forth negotiation. Read

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**“this offer is very close to the compensation I’m looking for”** implies
    that the offer isn’t enough for you. It also implies you won’t accept the offer
    unless it’s moved to 120k.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**“Increasing the base from $100K to $120K would make me committed and ready
    to join X”** implies you aren’t committed as it stands right now. So if they can’t
    increase the base salary to $120K, and you accept the lower offer, it means that
    you would join the company, with less than 100% commitment and enthusiasm. As
    an employer, would they really want that? If the economy improves in a year or
    2, and you get a lot of offers in the future, it’s likely you’ll just move to
    greener pastures.'
  prefs:

    the offer unless it’s upped to 120K, and you won’t be committed if the final offer

    the recruiter an ultimatum: Accept your offer or pay you the lower salary, and
    accept you won’t be 100% happy when you join. Your message is **NOT** aligned
    with the risk you were willing to take.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**“Similar roles are paying $120K. Pay equity is important to me, as I’m sure
    it is for company X”** You’re giving them extra research that shows you’re not
    just trying to milk a higher amount. Talking about pay equity is also a gentler
    way to remind hiring managers that you want a win-win situation, and a way to
    reframe the counter-offer as a desire to align with some higher value (pay equity)
    rather than being greedy.'

- en: In conclusion, advice like “it can’t hurt to ask for more” might be good advice
    when the job market is good, but in a tight job market, it’s not only bad advice,
    it’s dangerous advice. It’s unfortunate that recruiters/hiring managers are acting
    so impulsively, but remember, companies have full pipelines of qualified candidates
    to choose from today. So when you ask for more money, you need to do it the right
    way, and ***that depends entirely on your your leverage and your risk appetite***.
    In short, you need to tailor your message to the risk you are willing to take.
    Be 100% clear on your intentions, and don’t inadvertently reject the offer in
    the negotiation process.
