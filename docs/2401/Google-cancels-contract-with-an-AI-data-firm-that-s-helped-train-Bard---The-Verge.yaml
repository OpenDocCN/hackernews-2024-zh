- en: Google ended its contract with Appen, an Australian data company involved in
    training its large language model AI tools used in Bard, Search, and other products,
    even as the competition to develop generative AI tools increases. “Our decision
    to end the contract was made as part of our ongoing effort to evaluate and adjust
    many of our supplier partnerships across Alphabet to ensure our vendor operations
    are as efficient as possible,” Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini said in a
    statement sent to *The Verge*.

    parts of training AI and are often the lower-paid, often ignored [backbone of
    the entire industry](/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots).
    At Appen, contractors help rate data quality and answers from AI models. [*Fast
    Company*](https://www.fastcompany.com/90906492/google-bard-ai-raters-fired) wrote
    last year that some Appen employees who are members of the Alphabet Workers Union
    had been petitioning Appen to increase wages from $10 an hour to $15\. While the
    union won wage increases, the final number fell short of its goal. Many of these
    workers were then laid off, with Appen citing business conditions.

    reported that Appen has also helped train AI models for Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.
    The company said in its ASX filing that its work with Google has had a significant
    impact on its revenue. Appen’s revenue from Google alone in the fiscal year 2023
    amounted to $82.8 million. It made $273 million last year.'
