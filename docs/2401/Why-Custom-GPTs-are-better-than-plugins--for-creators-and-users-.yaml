- en: On November 6, 2023, [OpenAI announced Custom GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts).
    Since then, over 3 million GPTs have been created, with over 200.000 of them made
    publicly available.

- en: Fundamentally, Custom GPTs come with pre-configured actions and capabilities
    (e.g., do something in app “X”), as well as specific embedded knowledge for the
    task they have been built for. That also means that instead of users having to
    turn plugins on & off manually, they can switch conversations depending on the
    task, which usually is way quicker and more intuitive.

- en: The biggest thing that a lot of developers waiting to get invited by OpenAI
    to write traditional plugins are missing is that you can not only do the same
    but more with GPTs, but also that in contrast to publishing plugins, GPTs can
    be listed on the “GPT Store” or simply by sharing a direct URL. Which ultimately
    results in way more GPTs being made available than plugins.

- en: Previously, people had to try plugins to somehow get an idea of how to use them
    and what good examples to use them for. But with easy-to-add conversation starters,
    GPT creators can give users a couple of suggestions based on what their GPT is
    good at.

- en: For best results, you’d still want to integrate with your product API. Especially
    if you aim to get more users to discover your product and services via the GPT.
    But the great thing is for pure “knowledge” driven GPTs, creators don’t even have
    to do that. Instead, all they need to do is add an “instruction” paragraph (to
    provide the GPT with necessary context) and upload your knowledge as files.

    of another GPT. This allows you to ask a GPT for the Top 10 games for Switch,
    and then mention the [Forms, Checklists & Workflows GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-yRy2XuCMc-forms-checklists-workflows)
    to create a checklist for you to tick off a game you played or beat.
