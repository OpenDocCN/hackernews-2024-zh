- en: WIRED’s request for the documents promised in OpenAI’s IRS filings fell to the
    counsel for its nonprofit to decide on. Their denial and new policy of withholding
    those documents extends an existing trend of dwindling openness at a project founded
    on transparency. OpenAI once published extensive detail about its AI inventions
    but has more recently guarded the technical details and data behind its most famous
    tool, ChatGPT. Felix, the company spokesperson, says San Francisco-based OpenAI
    discloses all the material required by the IRS and California’s attorney general
    and that it regularly publishes information about [its research and safety work](https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization),
    while also making its research freely available in the form of tools such as ChatGPT.

    [created a for-profit subsidiary](https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/)
    to house most of its AI development and draw outside investment. That opened the
    way for OpenAI to hitch its future to the largesse of Microsoft, one of the tech
    giants it was founded to challenge, and also to shroud its finances. OpenAI cofounder
    turned [competitor](https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-elon-musks-xai-chatgpt-hallucinating/)

    of OpenAI’s activities and technology. Like all US nonprofits, it must publicly
    share upon request a copy of its annual report to the IRS and indicate in those
    submissions whether any additional documents like its bylaws or similar or related
    documents such as a governing constitution or conflict of interest policy were
    also available to the public during the last year.

    publishes its [bylaws](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/bill_and_melinda_gates_foundation_board_governing_principles.pdf)
    and rules [on conflicts](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/conflict_of_interest_policy.pdf)
    and [workplace relationships](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/personal-relationships-policy.pdf),
    but it’s not standard practice.

    It’s unclear if anyone ever took OpenAI up on the invitation in the years through
    2022—OpenAI won’t say.

    —— OpenAI不愿透露。
- en: Last month, after two days of waiting on OpenAI communications staff to fulfill
    an emailed request for its governing documents, conflict rules, and financial
    statements, WIRED rang the doorbell outside OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters
    on December 14 asking to see all those documents. A receptionist said over an
    intercom that wouldn’t be possible, hung up, and didn’t reengage. OpenAI’s IRS
    filing for 2023 that would reflect it has changed its previous policy isn’t due
    until later this year.

    [provisions of tax law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103). OpenAI
    hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, and Felix says OpenAI’s reports are available
