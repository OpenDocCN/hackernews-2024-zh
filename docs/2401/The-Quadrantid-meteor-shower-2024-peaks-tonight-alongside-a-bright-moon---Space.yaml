    actually radiate from the northeast corner of the constellation of Boötes, the
    Herdsman, so we might expect them to be called the "Boötids." But back in the
    late-18th century there was a constellation here called "Quadrans Muralis," the
    "Mural or Wall Quadrant" (an astronomical instrument). Quadrans Muralis is a long-obsolete
    star pattern, invented in 1795 by J.J. Lalande to commemorate the instrument used
    to observe the [stars](https://www.space.com/57-stars-formation-classification-and-constellations.html)
    in his catalog.

- en: Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory discovered the shower in the 1830s,
    and shortly afterward it was noted by several astronomers in Europe and America.
    Thus, they were christened "Quadrantids" (pronounced KWA-dran-tids) and even though
    the constellation from which these [meteors](https://www.space.com/meteor-showers-shooting-stars.html)
    appear to radiate no longer exists, the shower's original moniker continues to
    this day.

    derived within the last 500-years from a small comet. The parentage of the Quadrantids
    had long been a mystery. Then Dr. Peter Jenniskens, an astronomer at the SETI
    Institute in Mountain View, Calif., noticed that the orbit of 2003 EH1 — a small
    asteroid [discovered in March 2003](https://www.space.com/4925-hard-meteor-shower-observed-arctic.html)
    — "falls snug in the shower." He believes that this 1.2-mile (2 km) chunk of rock
    is the source of the Quadrantids; possibly this asteroid is the burnt-out core
    of the lost [comet](https://www.space.com/comets.html) C/1490 Y1.

- en: As viewed from mid-northern latitudes, we have to get up before dawn to see
    the Quadrantids at their best. This is because the radiant — that part of the
    sky from where the meteors appear to emanate — is down low on the northern horizon
    until about midnight, rising slowly higher in the northeast as the night progresses.
    The growing light of dawn ends meteor observing usually by around 6 a.m. So, if
    the "Quads" are to be seen at all, some part of that six-hour active period must
    fall between 2 and 6 a.m.

- en: This year will be a favorable year to watch for the peak of this meteor display
    across much of North America. According to meteor experts, Margaret Campbell-Brown
    and Peter Brown in the 2024 Observer's Handbook of the Royal Astronomical Society
    of Canada, the peak of this year's shower is predicted for 4 a.m. Eastern Time
    or 1 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, Jan. 4\. So, across the contiguous U.S. and
    southern Canada, maximum activity will arrive as the radiant of the "Quads" is
    ascending toward a favorable viewing position in the northeast sky. The eastern
    states hold an advantage as the radiant will be noticeably higher up in the sky
    as opposed to locations farther to the west.

    this year in the form of [the moon.](https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html)

    display and this is one of those years.

- en: In 2024, the moon arrives at its last quarter phase about six hours before the
    peak of the shower. That means that on the morning of Jan. 4, there is going to
    be a bright half-moon (actually a very wide waning crescent), situated in the
    constellation [Virgo](https://www.space.com/17021-virgo-constellation.html), that
    will be reaching its highest point in the southern sky just as dawn is breaking.
    As luck would have it, this particular meteor display is at its best just before
    the break of dawn — about 6 a.m. local time — when the Quadrantid radiant appears
    at its highest, about two-thirds of the way up in the northeastern sky.

    will brighten the sky somewhat, and will probably squelch a fair number of the
    fainter Quadrantid streaks.

    you may not see more than 20 or 30 of these blue streakers during a single hour.
    Out West, you might catch sight of about a dozen or so Quads per hour.

- en: 'Lastly — and I''ve touched on this point many times before, but certainly it
    should be addressed again: Your local weather will likely be more appropriate
    for taking in a hot bath as opposed to a meteor shower. And indeed, at this time
    of year, meteor watching can be a long, cold business. You wait and you wait for
    meteors to appear and when they don''t appear right away, and if you''re cold
    and uncomfortable, you''re not going to be looking for meteors for very long!
    Therefore, make sure you''re warm and comfortable. Warm cocoa or coffee can take
    the edge off the chill, as well as provide a slight stimulus. It''s even better
    if you can observe with friends. That way, you can cover more sky.'
