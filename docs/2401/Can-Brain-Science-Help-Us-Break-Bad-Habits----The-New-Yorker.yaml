    to send an e-mail, look up a fact, or buy something no matter where I was meant
    a previously unimaginable gain in productivity. Every time I got an e-mail, the
    phone emitted a ping and I would deal with whatever it was, priding myself on
    my efficiency. Texts arrived with the tones of a French horn and were similarly
    dispatched. Soon, I was reaching for the device every time it made a sound, like
    Pavlov’s dog salivating when it heard a bell. This started to interfere with work
    and conversations. The machine had seemed like a miraculous servant, but gradually
    I became its slave.

    medical training—with its early mornings and its long shifts when your friends
    are partying—I had an established track record of delaying gratification. It didn’t
    matter. When I tried switching the phone to silent, I ended up checking it perhaps
    even more often, *just in case* there was something to deal with. The only time
    I managed to resist was during Shabbos, when I don’t read e-mail. But I’d be watching
    the clock, counting the hours till I could turn the thing on. For the first time,
    I could imagine what it’s like to be a smoker craving a cigarette. Checking the
    smartphone had become a bad habit that I couldn’t break.

    in the Nicomachean Ethics, surveyed existing notions of virtue and offered this
    summary: “Some thinkers hold that it is by nature that people become good, others
    that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” He concluded that
    habits were responsible. Cicero called habit “second nature,” a phrase that we
    still use. And when Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 27, considered
    how to create citizens who would obey the federal laws of the newly formed republic,
    he used another proverbial phrase: “Man is very much a creature of habit.” If
    federal law permeated matters at the state level, it would seem part of everyday
    life. “The more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the
    passions of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent
    and perilous expedients of compulsion,” he wrote.'

    Psychologists have explored the genesis of habitual behavior and its impact on
    health and happiness. William James, echoing Aristotle, wrote, “All our life,
    so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits,—practical, emotional,
    and intellectual . . . bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny.”

    power? Marketers flatter our sense of agency with slogans like “Just Do It” (Nike)
    and “Declare Your Path” (New Balance). Much popular psychology, too, bolsters
    our belief in self-control. In the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, devised
    by Walter Mischel, in the nineteen-sixties, children were seated alone in front
    of a marshmallow and were scored on whether they resisted gobbling it down. The
    resulting determination of a child’s level of “executive function” supposedly
    distinguishes life’s winners and losers, predicting such things as performance
    on the SAT, duration of relationships, and career success. But how can that be,
    if we’re just creatures of habit?

    (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the social psychologist Wendy Wood refutes both James’s
    determinism and glib exhortations to be proactive, and seeks to give the general
    reader more realistic ideas for how to break habits. Drawing on her work in the
    field, she sees the task of sustaining positive behaviors and quelling negative
    ones as involving an interplay of decisions and unconscious factors. Our minds,
    Wood explains, have “multiple separate but interconnected mechanisms that guide
    behavior.” But we are aware only of our decision-making ability—a phenomenon known
    as the “introspection illusion”—and that may be why we overestimate its power.
    The executive functions that make will power possible give us, she writes, “the
    sense of agency that we recognize as ‘me.’ ” But that comes at a cost in terms
    of effort. To go about our lives, we need to make some behaviors automatic.

    networks that are active during rote and conscious tasks. A brain scan of someone
    learning a task shows activity in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, networks
    associated with decision-making and executive control. With repetition of a task,
    brain activity moves into areas of the putamen and the basal ganglia, deep in
    what Wood calls “the rudimentary machinery of our minds.” There, a task is turned
    into a habit.

    sequences of actions become linked, a process known as “chunking.” When we get
    into a car and drive off, we don’t need to think about the separate actions of
    buckling a seat belt, turning on the ignition, putting the car in drive, checking
    the mirrors and the blind spot, and pressing the gas pedal. All these steps, chunked
    into a single unit in the memory, are triggered by the environmental cue of getting
    into your car. This frees us up to concentrate on what most requires conscious
    attention. We can think about where we’re going or the day’s tasks, and keep an
    eye out for anything unusual on the road.

    occasional behaviors,” like getting a flu shot, conscious decisions were all that
    was required. For behaviors involving repetition, though, habits were crucial.
    William James estimated that “ninety-nine hundredths or, possibly, nine hundred
    and ninety-nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and habitual.”
    This was a guess; Wood, however, devised a study to quantify just how often people
    act out of habit. Using a research technique known as experience sampling, she
    had participants spend two days recording what they did while they were doing
    it. Results varied across the groups studied, but the basic finding was that our
    actions are habitual forty-three per cent of the time.

    and why public-health initiatives that educate people about healthy choices tend
    to fail. In 1991, the National Cancer Institute determined that only eight per
    cent of Americans were aware of the recommendation to eat at least five servings
    of fruit and vegetables daily. A national campaign was declared: 5 a Day for Better
    Health. Six years later, thirty-nine per cent of Americans knew about five servings
    a day, a nearly fivefold increase, but actual diets had barely changed. In 2007,
    government officials tried again, launching a program called Fruits & Veggies—More
    Matters. Even so, by 2018 only twelve per cent of Americans ate the recommended
    two servings of fruit daily, and only nine per cent ate three servings of vegetables.
    Simply informing us of what’s good for us doesn’t work, because so much of our
    eating, cooking, and shopping is governed by habit.'

    to resist eating the marshmallow for fifteen minutes. This implies that a large
    majority of us lack the self-control required to succeed in life. But a less discussed
    part of the study suggests a way of circumventing our frailty. The researchers
    compared the results of two situations: in one, children could see the marshmallow
    in front of them; in the other, they knew that it was there but couldn’t see it.
    On average, the children lasted only six minutes when presented with visible temptation
    but could manage ten minutes if the treat was hidden. For Wood, this outcome shows
    that self-control is “not so much an inherent disposition but instead a reflection
    of the situation we are in.” A few tweaks to our environment may enable us to
    emulate people who seem more disciplined.'

    students were told to report every time they thought, “Oops, I shouldn’t do this”—for
    instance, when they stayed up too late, overslept, overate, or procrastinated.
    They were most successful at adopting productive behaviors not when they resolved
    to do better, or distracted themselves from temptation, but when they altered
    their environment. Instead of studying on a couch in a dorm, with a TV close by,
    they went to the library. They ate better when they removed junk food from the
    dorm refrigerator. “Successful self-control,” Wood writes, “came from essentially
    covering up the marshmallow.”

    virtue to situational factors rather than to sheer fortitude. A study of such
    people in Germany found that they reported resisting temptation surprisingly rarely.
    “They were living their lives in a way that hid the marshmallow almost all the
    time,” Wood writes. This observation leads to the crux of her book’s thesis: the
    path to breaking bad habits lies not in resolve but in restructuring our environment
    in ways that sustain good behaviors. Wood cites the psychologist Kurt Lewin, who
    argued that behavior was influenced by “a constellation of forces” analogous to
    gravity or to the fluid dynamics that make a river run faster or slower. Those
    forces work depending on where you are, who’s around you, the time of day, and
    your recent actions. We achieve situational control, paradoxically, not through
    will power but by finding ways to take will power out of the equation.'

    if we can make bad habits more inconvenient, then inertia can carry us in the
    direction of virtue, without ever requiring us to be strong. She cites the ways
    in which increased friction has produced a decline in smoking: laws that ban it
    in restaurants, bars, airplanes, and trains; taxes that have helped triple the
    price of cigarettes in the U.S. in the past twenty years; the purge of cigarettes
    from vending machines, and of tobacco ads from TV and the radio.'

    taking an order at McDonald’s is scripted to ask, “Would you like fries with that?”
    This simple question encourages us to eat more fat and carbs. Binge-watching on
    Netflix or Hulu is facilitated by the way that the next episode starts automatically
    as the credits roll on the previous one. Wood talks to M. Keith Chen, a former
    head of economic research for Uber, who explains that the app was designed to
    minimize friction. “The phone’s GPS knows where you are,” he says. “You don’t
    even need to think about it. . . . You get out without handling cash.”

    Charles Duhigg’s best-seller “[The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X)”
    (2012). Like Wood, Duhigg, who when he wrote the book was a reporter at the *Times*,
    notes ways that the fast-food industry designs prompts to make us consume more.
    McDonald’s standardizes the appearance of its restaurants, in order to trigger
    habitual eating routines. The foods at many chains are specifically engineered
    to deliver bursts of salt and fat that immediately light up the reward centers
    of the brain.

- en: Examining corporate efforts to capitalize on habit formation, Duhigg describes
    the work of an early-twentieth-century advertising guru, Claude C. Hopkins, whose
    campaign for Pepsodent toothpaste is said to have established toothbrushing as
    habitual among Americans. When Pepsodent first appeared, in 1915, few people bothered
    to brush their teeth, and a leading dental researcher of the time pronounced all
    toothpastes useless. Hopkins focussed his marketing message on the film of plaque
    that covers our teeth; in 1917, his newspaper ads proclaimed it “the basic cause
    of all tooth troubles.” In fact, plaque can be temporarily removed simply by eating
    an apple, and toothpastes of the time didn’t remove any more of it than brushing
    without toothpaste did. Nevertheless, Hopkins set about amping up the dangers
    of plaque and telling the public that Pepsodent was the only way to get rid of
    it. “Just run your tongue across your teeth,” another ad read. “*You’ll feel a
    film*—that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.” In just
    a few years, Pepsodent had become one of the best-known products in the world.

- en: 'Duhigg, like Wood, sees habitual routines as being driven by cues and rewards.
    Pepsodent wasn’t the only brand that claimed to remove the film on teeth, but
    ingredients that it used to insure a fresh taste, such as citric acid and mint
    oil, also happened to be mild irritants, which produced a satisfying tingle in
    the mouth. If Hopkins, by making consumers aware of the film on their teeth, had
    created a cue, the toothpaste itself provided a physical reward. Such loops of
    cue and reward are powerful: if we haven’t brushed our teeth, something feels
    wrong. Two decades after Hopkins launched his campaign, using toothpaste had become
    the norm for a sizable majority of the U.S. population. Hopkins, as Duhigg puts
    it, had “created a craving.”'

    Duhigg writes about a woman who bites her nails and is advised to find something
    else to do with her hands that will produce a comparable physical stimulation,
    such as rapping her knuckles on a desk. The idea is to keep the powerful structure
    of cue and reward intact but to tweak the content of the routine. For both writers,
    though, the key lies not in breaking a habit through will power but in replacing
    one habit with another.

    in analyzing it, the better to formulate a strategy for reform. Duhigg describes
    how, after having gained some weight, he gave up getting a cookie each afternoon
    in the *Times* cafeteria. Putting a no-cookie injunction on a Post-it note was
    a non-starter: he’d ignore it, wander to the cafeteria, chat with colleagues at
    the cash register, and buy and eat his cookie. So he set about identifying the
    trigger for his habit, adopting five categories proposed by researchers: time,
    place, emotional state, other people, and the action immediately preceding the
    habitual one. Was he hungry, or bored, or in need of a break or a blood-sugar
    boost? He switched up his routine, eating a doughnut at his desk instead of visiting
    the cafeteria, or taking a brief stroll outside. He was testing hypotheses: if
    eating the doughnut at his desk didn’t sate the urge to go to the cafeteria, he
    could rule out sugar. By a process of elimination, he determined that his habit
    was really driven by a need for interaction and distraction. The best replacement
    for a cookie turned out to be going over to a friend’s desk to chat.'

    smartphones. She offers a stepwise strategy. First, recognize your dependency,
    and acknowledge how the habit disrupts work, social interactions, and safe driving.
    Next, “control the context cues,” meaning identify what triggers you to grab the
    phone. For me, the cues are aural (the ping, the French horn) and visual (pop-ups
    on the screen). I already knew that putting the phone on silent wasn’t enough
    to break the habit, but, as in the marshmallow experiment, out of sight could
    be out of mind. In the mornings, preparing breakfast, I found that it helped to
    leave the phone in another room. In the car, it went in the glove compartment.
    When walking around, I’d put it in a zippered pocket. There were other ways of
    generating friction and making the habit harder to indulge. Turning the phone
    off completely was much more effective than silencing it, not because I wasn’t
    curious about who might have e-mailed me but because turning it back on was a
    hassle.
