    to send an e-mail, look up a fact, or buy something no matter where I was meant
    a previously unimaginable gain in productivity. Every time I got an e-mail, the
    phone emitted a ping and I would deal with whatever it was, priding myself on
    my efficiency. Texts arrived with the tones of a French horn and were similarly
    dispatched. Soon, I was reaching for the device every time it made a sound, like
    Pavlov’s dog salivating when it heard a bell. This started to interfere with work
    and conversations. The machine had seemed like a miraculous servant, but gradually
    I became its slave.

    medical training—with its early mornings and its long shifts when your friends
    are partying—I had an established track record of delaying gratification. It didn’t
    matter. When I tried switching the phone to silent, I ended up checking it perhaps
    even more often, *just in case* there was something to deal with. The only time
    I managed to resist was during Shabbos, when I don’t read e-mail. But I’d be watching
    the clock, counting the hours till I could turn the thing on. For the first time,
    I could imagine what it’s like to be a smoker craving a cigarette. Checking the
    smartphone had become a bad habit that I couldn’t break.

    in the Nicomachean Ethics, surveyed existing notions of virtue and offered this
    summary: “Some thinkers hold that it is by nature that people become good, others
    that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” He concluded that
    habits were responsible. Cicero called habit “second nature,” a phrase that we
    still use. And when Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 27, considered
    how to create citizens who would obey the federal laws of the newly formed republic,
    he used another proverbial phrase: “Man is very much a creature of habit.” If
    federal law permeated matters at the state level, it would seem part of everyday
    life. “The more it circulates through those channels and currents in which the
    passions of mankind naturally flow, the less will it require the aid of the violent
    and perilous expedients of compulsion,” he wrote.'

    Psychologists have explored the genesis of habitual behavior and its impact on
    health and happiness. William James, echoing Aristotle, wrote, “All our life,

    and “Declare Your Path” (New Balance). Much popular psychology, too, bolsters
    our belief in self-control. In the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, devised
    by Walter Mischel, in the nineteen-sixties, children were seated alone in front
    of a marshmallow and were scored on whether they resisted gobbling it down. The
    resulting determination of a child’s level of “executive function” supposedly
    distinguishes life’s winners and losers, predicting such things as performance
    on the SAT, duration of relationships, and career success. But how can that be,

    (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the social psychologist Wendy Wood refutes both James’s
    determinism and glib exhortations to be proactive, and seeks to give the general
    reader more realistic ideas for how to break habits. Drawing on her work in the
    field, she sees the task of sustaining positive behaviors and quelling negative
    ones as involving an interplay of decisions and unconscious factors. Our minds,
    Wood explains, have “multiple separate but interconnected mechanisms that guide
    behavior.” But we are aware only of our decision-making ability—a phenomenon known
    as the “introspection illusion”—and that may be why we overestimate its power.
    The executive functions that make will power possible give us, she writes, “the
    sense of agency that we recognize as ‘me.’ ” But that comes at a cost in terms
    of effort. To go about our lives, we need to make some behaviors automatic.

    buckling a seat belt, turning on the ignition, putting the car in drive, checking
    the mirrors and the blind spot, and pressing the gas pedal. All these steps, chunked
    into a single unit in the memory, are triggered by the environmental cue of getting

    occasional behaviors,” like getting a flu shot, conscious decisions were all that
    was required. For behaviors involving repetition, though, habits were crucial.
    William James estimated that “ninety-nine hundredths or, possibly, nine hundred
    and ninety-nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and habitual.”
    This was a guess; Wood, however, devised a study to quantify just how often people
    act out of habit. Using a research technique known as experience sampling, she
    had participants spend two days recording what they did while they were doing
    it. Results varied across the groups studied, but the basic finding was that our

    a day, a nearly fivefold increase, but actual diets had barely changed. In 2007,
    government officials tried again, launching a program called Fruits & Veggies—More
    Matters. Even so, by 2018 only twelve per cent of Americans ate the recommended
    two servings of fruit daily, and only nine per cent ate three servings of vegetables.

    2007年，政府官员再次尝试，推出了一个名为水果和蔬菜-更重要的计划。即便如此，到2018年只有百分之十二的美国人每日摄入建议的两份水果，只有百分之九的人摄入三份蔬菜。仅仅告诉我们什么对我们有好处并不起作用，因为我们的大部分饮食、烹饪和购物受习惯支配。

    in front of them; in the other, they knew that it was there but couldn’t see it.
    On average, the children lasted only six minutes when presented with visible temptation
    but could manage ten minutes if the treat was hidden. For Wood, this outcome shows

    They were most successful at adopting productive behaviors not when they resolved
    to do better, or distracted themselves from temptation, but when they altered
    their environment. Instead of studying on a couch in a dorm, with a TV close by,

    time,” Wood writes. This observation leads to the crux of her book’s thesis: the
    path to breaking bad habits lies not in resolve but in restructuring our environment
    in ways that sustain good behaviors. Wood cites the psychologist Kurt Lewin, who
    argued that behavior was influenced by “a constellation of forces” analogous to
    gravity or to the fluid dynamics that make a river run faster or slower. Those
    forces work depending on where you are, who’s around you, the time of day, and

    the work of an early-twentieth-century advertising guru, Claude C. Hopkins, whose
    campaign for Pepsodent toothpaste is said to have established toothbrushing as
    habitual among Americans. When Pepsodent first appeared, in 1915, few people bothered
    to brush their teeth, and a leading dental researcher of the time pronounced all
    toothpastes useless. Hopkins focussed his marketing message on the film of plaque
    that covers our teeth; in 1917, his newspaper ads proclaimed it “the basic cause
    of all tooth troubles.” In fact, plaque can be temporarily removed simply by eating
    an apple, and toothpastes of the time didn’t remove any more of it than brushing
    without toothpaste did. Nevertheless, Hopkins set about amping up the dangers
    of plaque and telling the public that Pepsodent was the only way to get rid of
    it. “Just run your tongue across your teeth,” another ad read. “*You’ll feel a
    film*—that’s what makes your teeth look ‘off color’ and invites decay.” In just
    a few years, Pepsodent had become one of the best-known products in the world.

  zh: 杜希格在研究公司利用习惯养成的努力时描述了二十世纪初广告大师克劳德·C·霍普金斯的工作，后者因其为Pepsodent牙膏制作的广告而闻名于世，据说已经将刷牙习惯化成了美国人的日常习惯。当Pepsodent首次出现时，即1915年，几乎没有人费心刷牙，当时的一位主要牙科研究者宣称所有牙膏都是无用的。霍普金斯将他的营销信息集中在覆盖牙齿的牙垢膜上；1917年，他的报纸广告宣称牙垢膜是“所有牙齿问题的基本原因”。事实上，牙垢膜可以通过简单地吃一个苹果来暂时去除，而当时的牙膏并不能比不用牙膏刷牙更多地去除它。然而，霍普金斯开始夸大牙垢的危险性，并告诉公众只有Pepsodent才是消除牙垢的唯一方法。“只需用舌头舔一下你的牙齿，”另一则广告写道。“*你会感觉到一层膜*——这就是你的牙齿看起来‘颜色不正常’并且易蛀的原因。”在短短几年时间里，Pepsodent已成为世界上最著名的产品之一。
- en: 'Duhigg, like Wood, sees habitual routines as being driven by cues and rewards.
    Pepsodent wasn’t the only brand that claimed to remove the film on teeth, but
    ingredients that it used to insure a fresh taste, such as citric acid and mint
    oil, also happened to be mild irritants, which produced a satisfying tingle in
    the mouth. If Hopkins, by making consumers aware of the film on their teeth, had
    created a cue, the toothpaste itself provided a physical reward. Such loops of
    cue and reward are powerful: if we haven’t brushed our teeth, something feels
    wrong. Two decades after Hopkins launched his campaign, using toothpaste had become
    the norm for a sizable majority of the U.S. population. Hopkins, as Duhigg puts
    it, had “created a craving.”'

    Duhigg writes about a woman who bites her nails and is advised to find something
    else to do with her hands that will produce a comparable physical stimulation,
    such as rapping her knuckles on a desk. The idea is to keep the powerful structure
    of cue and reward intact but to tweak the content of the routine. For both writers,

    a non-starter: he’d ignore it, wander to the cafeteria, chat with colleagues at
    the cash register, and buy and eat his cookie. So he set about identifying the
    trigger for his habit, adopting five categories proposed by researchers: time,
    place, emotional state, other people, and the action immediately preceding the
    habitual one. Was he hungry, or bored, or in need of a break or a blood-sugar
    boost? He switched up his routine, eating a doughnut at his desk instead of visiting
    the cafeteria, or taking a brief stroll outside. He was testing hypotheses: if
    eating the doughnut at his desk didn’t sate the urge to go to the cafeteria, he
    could rule out sugar. By a process of elimination, he determined that his habit
    was really driven by a need for interaction and distraction. The best replacement
