- en: Looking​ back to September 1820, when things had gone badly wrong but not yet
    so grotesquely as to be visibly beyond repair, we can see how few and how poor
    Keats’s options were. Surely it was better that (in the absence of other volunteers)
    the young artist Joseph Severn agreed to travel with the dying poet to Rome that
    autumn than that he had refused. When we rerun the history in our minds, wishing
    to find a way to make it all happen differently, it is hard to know whether, for
    the sake of Keats and his literary afterlife, to keep Severn at his side during
    these last months or magically to erase him. Severn was affectionate; he was foolish;
    and the foolishness made the affection a little embarrassing and eventually damaging
    to them both. But to have someone familiar there to hold you up and soothe you
    as you drowned in your own dark blood, choking on the ‘clay-like expectoration’
    from your dissolving lungs – this must be preferable to drowning and choking alone.
    The reader’s urge to rerun the story in order to repair the intolerable injustice
    may be embarrassing and damaging too.

  zh: 回顾1820年9月，当事情出了大问题但尚未如此怪诞到明显无法挽回时，我们可以看到济慈的选择有多少，以及有多糟糕。当时年轻的艺术家约瑟夫·塞文（Joseph
    Severn）同意在那个秋天和垂死的诗人一起前往罗马，而不是拒绝（因为没有其他志愿者），这显然比拒绝要好。当我们在脑海中重新演绎这段历史，希望找到一种让一切都发生不同的方式时，很难知道是为了济慈及其文学来世的缘故，还是在这些最后几个月里让塞文一直陪伴在他身边，还是神奇地将他抹去。塞文很亲切；他很愚蠢；这种愚蠢让这种亲切有点尴尬，并最终对他们两个人造成了伤害。但是，当你淹没在自己的黑暗鲜血中，呛着从你溶解的肺部排出的“像黏土般的痰液”时，有一个熟悉的人在那里扶着你、安慰你，这一定比独自淹没和呛咳要好。读者想要重新演绎这个故事以修复不可忍受的不公正可能也是尴尬和有害的。
- en: Racing ahead of other threats – including syphilis, the mercury that Keats had
    prescribed himself to treat the syphilis, and the extreme anxiety caused by the
    mercury – tuberculosis was destroying Keats. His doctors (some of them eminent,
    some benevolent, none of them helpful) knew something was wrong (the violent haemorrhages
    were a clue) but disagreed about what precisely it was. They warned him he would
    not survive unless he took himself to a milder climate, avoided all sources of
    excitement, including writing, had himself rigorously and regularly and most redundantly
    bled, and refrained from eating more than would keep a starving man alive. Keats
    had trained in surgery, treated consumptive patients and nursed first his mother
    during the consumption that killed her and then his brother Tom. Though not well
    understood or treatable, the symptoms of what we know as tuberculosis were familiar
    enough. Keats recognised at once the colour and meaning of the arterial blood
    he vomited up and knew he would not survive.

    in practical terms homeless. His surviving brother, George, who would die of intestinal
    tuberculosis two decades later, was in America with his wife, Georgiana, trying
    to make his fortune; his dearest friend, Charles Armitage Brown, was on a summer
    walking tour, having frugally rented out the house he had been sharing with Keats
    since Tom’s death nearly two years before. No one would come with Keats to the
    warm climate his doctors prescribed. Keats’s friends had urgent responsibilities
    to their own families, their own expectations, their own ambitions, opportunities,
    anxieties. Perhaps, like George, they were sure that his situation could not be
    as desperate as he affected to think; or, like Brown, they had begun to regard
    him as someone of such irremediable need that it was easier to pretend his messages
    had failed to arrive. It was not a new pattern in Keats’s life, and it continued
    beyond his death: those he most trusted most distressingly failed him.'

    Leigh Hunt’s chaotic hospitality in a rage over the household’s careless treatment
    of a letter from his painfully beloved Fanny Brawne. But he needed to leave in
    order to spare her the sight of the horrors he knew were coming for him. Severn’s
    companionship, solicited (though with many reservations about its fitness) and

    necessary to keep him alive long enough to reach Rome.

    such golden rewards as entrance to Rome in the role of a trusted protector, the
    proximity of patrons for his art, an excuse to run away from an illegitimate child
    he preferred not to acknowledge, and sentimental stories to tell about Keats,
    whose poetry was just beginning to attract critical admiration from readers beyond
    his social circle. There would be souvenirs, too, to attest to the stories’ sometimes
    dubious truth. Severn would dine out on tender recollections of Keats’s gestures
    of appreciation and gratitude for the rest of his life; a professional celebrity
    widow, he would stand in his rooms in Rome, furnished with what Sue Brown, in
    her judicious 2009 biography of Severn, describes as ‘props’ carefully and as
    if casually displayed to elicit from admiring visitors questions about his art
    and his relationship to Keats; he would recall what it had been like to be in
    the presence of the poet when he was inspired to compose, say, ‘Bright Star’ –
    not that he would know, because he hadn’t in fact been there. When late in life
    Severn fell into financial distress, he hocked Keats’s pocket watch; when he died,
    his tombstone in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome (erected next to Keats’s own,
    and designed to match it) declared yet once more to passers-by that he had been
    Keats’s ‘devoted friend and death-bed companion’. Not even death could put a stop
    to his photobombing of Keats’s life.

  zh: Severn虽然不严肃，但善意，特别是当善意带来如此丰厚的回报，比如以信任的守护者的身份进入罗马，艺术赞助人的接近，逃避他不愿承认的私生子，以及关于济慈的感伤故事，后者的诗歌刚开始引起他社交圈之外读者的批评欣赏时。故事的真实性有时会受到怀疑，也会有纪念品为其作证。Severn会对济慈的赞赏和感激之举绵延细述，终其一生；作为一个职业名人的遗孀，他会站在他在罗马的房间里，那些由Sue
    Brown在她审慎的2009年关于Severn的传记中所描述的“道具”小心翼翼地展示出来，引来仰慕的访客们询问他的艺术和与济慈的关系；他会回忆起与诗人在灵感来临时创作《明星》等作品时的情景——尽管他实际上并不知道，因为他并没有在场。晚年时，Severn陷入了财务困境，他抵押了济慈的怀表；当他去世时，他在罗马新教公墓的墓碑上（立在济慈的旁边，并且设计得与之相匹配）再次向路人宣告，他曾是济慈的“忠实朋友和临终伴侣”。甚至死亡也不能阻止他对济慈生活的照相炸弹行为。
- en: Before the journey to Rome, Severn was not precisely Keats’s friend and certainly
    not a chosen intimate. Aesthetic imagination was not a bond between them. Severn
    had what Andrew Motion has described as ‘a horrible tendency to sound both snobbish
    and fawning when talking about his posh connections’. For him, art was a means
    of social advancement and truth a thing to improve on. His artistic distinction
    was bogus. The merit of his art didn’t win him a travelling fellowship from the
    Royal Academy of Art, merely the fact that no one else put in for it; even so,
    the judges had been reluctant to give him an award. Still Severn boasted of it
    (according to Brown, who, together with Grant Scott in his fine 2005 edition of
    Severn’s letters and memoirs, gives a good sense of the tone of the man), lying
    to his friends about the money it brought him. Worse, he had been peripherally
    involved in the catfishing of Tom Keats as he lay dying, a prank that broke Tom’s
    heart and enraged Keats. In Rome, with little choice of acquaintance, Keats still
    (except in hours of febrile delirium) kept the things that most pained him to
    himself. Half a century later, when Keats’s letters to Fanny Brawne surfaced,
    Severn was vexed by this evidence that Keats had not been open with him about
    how overwhelmingly she mattered to him. But what would have been the point of
    such a confidence? Severn would not have understood.

  zh: 在前往罗马之前，Severn并不是济慈的朋友，当然也不是被选择的亲密友人。审美想象力并没有成为他们之间的纽带。Andrew Motion描述了他“在谈论他的高贵关系时有一种可怕的倾向，既傲慢又谄媚”。对他而言，艺术是社会进步的手段，真理是需要改进的东西。他的艺术杰出是虚假的。他的艺术的价值并没有赢得皇家美术学院的旅行奖学金，仅仅是因为没有其他人申请；即便如此，评审们也不情愿给他奖项。尽管如此，Severn仍然炫耀它（根据Brown的说法，Brown与Grant
    Scott在他2005年精美的Severn信件和回忆录中，很好地呈现了这个人的语气），对他的朋友撒谎关于它给他带来的钱。更糟糕的是，他在汤姆·济慈临终时周围充当了支配性的角色，这个恶作剧使汤姆心碎，使济慈暴跳如雷。在罗马，几乎没有选择的交往对象，济慈仍然（除了在发热谵妄时）把最痛苦的事情留给自己。半个世纪后，当济慈写给范妮·布朗的信浮出水面时，Severn对此感到困扰，因为这证据表明，济慈没有向他坦白她对他的重要性。但是，这样的信任有什么意义呢？Severn是不会理解的。
- en: His grief for Keats’s suffering was as genuine as any of his other emotions,
    and in Rome he was an attentive, patient and kind nurse. Appalled by Keats’s physical
    wretchedness and psychic disintegration, he did his best, wearing himself out
    to keep Keats alive, even against Keats’s will, even against the pressure of his
    own exhaustion. ‘I have these three nights sat up with him from the apprehension
    of his dying,’ he wrote to William Haslam two days before the end. ‘Dr Clark has
    prepared me for it – but I shall be but little able to bear it – even this my
    horrible situation I cannot bear to cease by the loss of him.’

    for anecdotes in which he himself figured as the nobly self-sacrificing friend
    and witness. These sentimentalities he communicated to Shelley, who, less naive,
    used them to concoct in the elegy ‘Adonais’ a version of Keats as a ‘young flower
    … blighted in the bud’, a hapless youth attended in his need by ‘a young artist
    of the highest promise’ before being ‘hooted from the stage of life’. In another’s
    fate the critic-stung Shelley now wept his own. For Shelley’s friend Byron, already
    prepared to feel contempt, it was irresistibly amusing to think that the little
    Cockney ‘mankin’ who had once idolised him ‘should let itself be snuffed out by

- en: 'Keats’s​ background – his education, his precocity, his cultural style, and
    his friends and especially their representations of him – made him hard to place,
    and his social ambiguity became for his critics (some themselves what Gregory
    Dart in *Metropolitan Art and Literature 1810-40: Cockney Adventures* called ‘social
    amphibians’) a matter of derision. His parents managed a thriving London hostelry
    and inn, the Swan and Hoop, near Bedlam Hospital in Moorfields. In his 1963 biography
    Walter Jackson Bate represents the household as affectionate, and Keats in particular
    as brave, just and kind. In his 2012 biography, Nicholas Roe represents the young
    Keats as emotionally disturbed, prone to frighteningly violent outbursts (as when,
    at five years of age, he stood outside his mother’s bedroom with a toy sword,
    whether to prevent her from leaving or to prevent anyone from disturbing her is
    not clear); when he was old enough to go to school he was, Roe writes, ‘the school
    bully’. He represents the entire household as made toxic by Frances Keats’s alcoholism
    and troublesome sexual appetites. (The toxicity, in Roe’s view, was literal: Keats
    had a small head, seems to have had a slightly protruding upper lip and never
    grew past five feet, and Roe suggests he was a victim of foetal alcohol syndrome.
    If so, his extraordinary gifts would be particularly surprising, as would be his
    siblings’ escape from the syndrome.) We do know that Richard Abbey, the hostile,
    semi-incompetent, not quite honest tea merchant whom Keats’s grandmother Alice
    Jennings made trustee for the children’s inheritance (chosen because she admired
    his decision to adopt a two-year-old girl whose father had killed her mother),
    later told tales about Thomas Keats lavishing money on food and drink and Frances
    Keats lifting her skirts indecently high when she crossed mucky streets. To George,
    the only one of the children Abbey liked, he later said that Frances had been,

    Jackson Bate）描绘了这个家庭是充满了亲情的，特别是济慈本人是勇敢的，公正的和善良的。在他2012年的传记中，尼古拉斯·罗（Nicholas Roe）将年轻的济慈描绘为情绪不稳定，容易发生可怕的暴力爆发（比如，在五岁时，他站在母亲卧室外面拿着一把玩具剑，是为了阻止她离开还是为了阻止别人打扰她不清楚）；当他上学的年龄时，他是“校园恶霸”。他将整个家庭都描绘为弗朗西斯·济慈的酗酒和麻烦的性欲所使之毒化。（根据罗的观点，这种毒化是字面上的：济慈有一个小头，似乎上唇微突，而且身高从未超过五英尺，罗认为他是胎儿酒精综合症的受害者。如果是这样，他的非凡天赋将会特别令人惊讶，他的兄弟姐妹能够逃脱这种综合症也同样令人惊讶。）我们知道，理查德·艾比（Richard
    Abbey）是济慈的祖母艾丽丝·詹宁斯（Alice Jennings）所选择的敌意显露、半能干、不太诚实的茶叶商，她被任命为孩子们的继承人（因为她钦佩他决定收养一个两岁女孩，她的父亲杀死了她的母亲），后来他对乔治说，他喜欢的孩子里有唯一一个，他后来说弗朗西斯曾经是一个非常具有“才华和理性”的女人，就像她自己的母亲一样。

    Had Thomas Keats not fallen from his horse, had Frances not spun out of control,
    Keats would still have puzzled his critics, but he might have been better defended
    against them. He would have been able, as a child, to learn things the way a child
    learns them, by trying them out and surviving the discovery of the occasional
    error. There would have been money, removing at least some obstacles and deterring
    some culturally motivated attacks. He would still have gone to John Clarke’s humane
    and intellectually progressive Enfield academy, where Leigh Hunt, the radical
    journalist, poet, critic and editor of the *Examiner*, was excitedly read, rather
    than Harrow, where his mother had once meant to send him; but he would have continued
    to university. His Latin was good (during his surgical apprenticeship he finished
    the prose translation of the *Aeneid* he had begun at Enfield); he would have
    added Greek. When he wrote of the flowers that he knew so well from the botanical
    delights of Enfield, the pleasures of his grandparents’ grounds at Edmonton and
    his later botany-heavy lectures in pharmacology, his verse would not have been
    taken for that of someone who had encountered such things only in riotous pleasure
    gardens and thus had no real right to speak of them. Time would not have pressed
    on him so urgently. He would not have felt he must hurtle from imitations, casual

    Horse which was hard to catch, & good for nothing when he was caught – So your
    Book is hard to understand & good for nothing when it is understood’). Worse,
    Abbey tried to keep him from seeing or even writing to his little sister, Fanny,
    whose dog Abbey and his wife had got rid of when they made her their miserably
    unhappy ward. With Alice Jennings’s consent, Abbey removed the Keats boys from
    Enfield, making George a clerk in his business and sending John to be apprenticed
    to Thomas Hammond, the surgeon-apothecary who had failed to save their mother.
    (Tom, the youngest of the boys, was too delicate and soon too ill to work but
    lived with one or both of his brothers, reading poetry and making puns, for the
    short rest of his life.)

    - 所以你的书很难理解，当它被理解时一无是处”）。 更糟糕的是，艾比试图阻止他见或甚至写信给他的小妹妹芬妮，艾比和他的妻子当时已经把她们的狗扔掉了，当他们使她成为他们的悲惨不幸的受抚养者时。
    在艾丽丝·詹宁斯的同意下，艾比把基茨的男孩们从恩菲尔德带走，让乔治成为他的业务职员，并送约翰去拜托马斯·哈蒙德（Thomas Hammond），这位未能挽救他们的母亲的外科医生。

    way to begin a career, requiring no university education and (unlike a physician’s
    training) leading to no social distinction. Keats would be qualified to pull teeth,
    set bones, bleed the sick, dispense mostly useless or dangerous medicine and,
    with ether still decades away, cut into living bodies. Keats and Hammond soon
    quarrelled, and Keats moved out, quitting the apprenticeship. But Hammond’s insistence
    on extracting from Keats the full price expected for his room and board cost him
    nearly £1000\. Finished with Hammond but not yet with medicine, he moved his studies
    to Guy’s Hospital. There he studied under Astley Cooper, a student of John Hunter

    基茨和哈蒙德很快就吵架了，基茨搬了出去，退出了学徒。 但是哈蒙德坚持要从基茨那里提取他所期望的房租和饭钱的全部金额，这使他损失了将近1000英镑。 虽然已经结束了与哈蒙德的关系，但他对医学仍然不满足，他把他的学习转移到盖伊医院（Guy's
    Hospital）。 在那里，他在阿斯特利·库珀（Astley Cooper）的指导下学习，库珀是约翰·亨特（John Hunter）的学生，像他的导师一样，是一个贪得无厌的解剖学家，并担任“手脚笨拙的外科医生”威廉·卢卡斯（William

    he had earned his apothecary’s licence – at his first try, an unusual feat – he
    had had enough. According to Charles Brown, his decision to abandon surgery was
    motivated by the dread of inflicting harm on his patients. He hoped poetry might
    achieve what surgery could not and assumed that, even after all the money spent
    on his medical-surgical-pharmacological studies (including what had been wasted
    on Hammond), there would be enough to enable him to give up a medical career for
    a poetic one. He wished from the outset – so he wrote in ‘Sleep and Poetry’ –

- en: 'Time was up.​ Only devastations – three of them – lay ahead. The first came
    when George, in Louisville, decided he needed more money for his projects in America
    than Abbey had given him. Tom had been dead for a year, and George wanted his
    share of his brother’s estate. He knew Keats would have no influence with Abbey,
    so he returned to London (at significant expense) to confront Abbey himself and
    extract what he needed. It was a very rapid trip; Georgiana and their young daughter,
    back in Louisville, were ill, and he needed to return quickly. While he was in
    London he spent little time with his brother, preferring gayer amusements. He
    brushed off Keats’s anxieties: ‘You, John, have so many friends, they will be
    sure to take care of you.’ But he knew that Keats needed help even more than he
    did; in response to his request for money two months before, Keats had written:
    ‘I am in such a situation that were it not for the assistance of Brown & Taylor
    [his publisher], I must be as badly off as a man can be.’ George would not take
    the hint. When he left again for America he did so with far more money than Keats
    believed he had a right to. Keats may have been wrong in his accounting; the situation
    was extremely complicated and not at all well documented. Those able to follow
    the maddening intricacies of the family’s finances now believe that George did
    Keats no financial injury. Keats was injured nonetheless. By the time George left
    – six days before Keats suffered the overwhelming haemorrhage that made it clear
    to him that he was doomed – he was unable to pay even what he owed Brown. He and
    Brown had hoped they might make money from a play they had cobbled together, but
    Edmund Kean, who Keats had imagined might act in it, was on his way to America.
    Keats also hoped that some of the money he had been induced to lend to unceasingly
    importunate friends, Haydon especially, might be repaid; that hope too was disappointed.'

    - 在基兹患上令他明白自己注定要失败的压倒性大出血前六天 - 他甚至无法偿还自己欠布朗的钱。他和布朗曾希望通过他们凑在一起的一部剧赚钱，但奥德蒙德·基恩，基兹曾想象的可能在其中演出的演员，正在前往美国。基兹也希望一些他被不断纠缠不休的朋友以及海顿等人借出去的钱可能会被还回；这个希望也被落了空。

    else until Brown returned. He shifted from place to place during that final summer,

    so extraordinarily many of them; and this pressure allows him to make out patterns
    that would otherwise have remained invisible. Many of them have to do with the
    damage Keats suffered in his early years. It is intriguing to read that he wrote
    and published with an eye to the phases of the moon (he may have been born during
    a full moon; he may have thought the moon corresponded to ‘the female [aspect]
    of his own nature’). It is – at first – surprising too to read that everything
    that occurs or fails to occur or is abandoned on 14 April or 15 April or 24 April
    is a traumatic response to his father’s death. It is disturbing to read that when
    Keats writes, ‘We read fine things but never feel them to thee [*sic*] full until
    we have gone the same steps with the Author … you will know exactly my meaning
    when I say, that now I shall relish Hamlet more than I ever have done,’ he is
    suggesting that his own mother, like Gertrude, might have been having an adulterous
    affair and could have been complicit in her husband’s death. It is exasperating
    to be told that in ‘The Eve of St Agnes’ Keats modelled the virginal Madeline,
    raped in her sleep by the man she was dreaming of, on a whore in a comic Spanish
    fiction who reminded him of his whorish mother. And it is impossible to take at
    all seriously Roe’s suggestion (though he shares the belief with other scholars)
    that Keats became a great poet (a challenge for anyone, regardless of early injuries)
    to compensate for his shortness, a hypothesised effect of hypothesised foetal
    alcohol syndrome. As more and more of Keats’s life and work is connected more
    and more relentlessly to moons and to Aprils and to dead fathers and adulterous,
    murderous mothers, the connections begin to lose their plausibility. Too many
    things are being mapped onto too few.

    and their cousins and their cousins’ in-laws and those in-laws’ nephews and their
    boats and boatmen and the lyrics to the songs the boatmen sang. Here Keats matters
    less than George and his writing matters less than George’s business career. Gigante

    move to the excitedly advertised English Prairie in Illinois, a free state (that
    status was initially an attraction for George), where he could acquire 1400 acres
    of what was supposed to be good farmland of his own choosing. He married Georgiana,

    and Georgiana decided against settling in the English Prairie, which they found
    grim; dressed and comporting themselves as the well-to-do people they meant soon
    to become, they turned south towards Louisville in the slave state of Kentucky.
    Gigante describes a difficult passage through sometimes paradisal landscapes,
    dense with forests and blooms to the point nearly of impassability and thronged
    with birds and beasts. Pioneers destroyed as much as they could, slaughtering
    animals by the hundreds and thousands on ‘frolics’ for the grotesque fun of it.
    These landscapes no longer exist, and many of the hunted populations are now gone
    or nearly so. John James Audubon, not yet a portraitist of dead birds but a thriving
    con artist, had hoped to ‘see the surplus population of Europe coming to assist
    in the destruction of the forest’. It was beginning to happen. In Louisville,
    where they would settle and where George would establish his sawmill (and later
    build a flour mill and then begin acquiring real estate), the devastation was
    visible, the town all mud and ugliness, its trees all having been cut down and
    the sawdust burned in the streets.

  zh: 乔治不是一个崇高的人。从费城向西前进后，他和乔治安娜决定不在英格兰的大草原定居，他们觉得那里令人沮丧；他们打扮得体，举止得体，准备成为富裕人家，他们向南转向肯塔基州的奴隶州路易斯维尔。吉甘蒂描述了一段困难的旅程，有时风景如画，森林茂密，花朵繁茂，几乎无法通行，人群中挤满了鸟兽。拓荒者尽其所能摧毁了很多，为了怪诞的乐趣，他们屠杀了成百上千的动物。这些风景不复存在，许多被猎杀的群体现在已经消失或快要消失。尚未成为死鸟肖像画家而是一名欣欣向荣的骗子的约翰·詹姆斯·奥杜邦曾希望“看到欧洲的多余人口前来协助毁林”。这种情况正在开始发生。在他们将定居并且乔治将建立他的锯木厂（后来又建立了面粉厂，然后开始收购房地产）的路易斯维尔，毁灭是可见的，城镇充满了泥泞和丑陋，所有的树木都已被砍伐，锯末在街道上被烧掉了。
- en: 'Perhaps it would have been impossible to remain innocent in such a situation.
    The ugliness was deep and contaminating. A popular Louisville pastime, Gigante
    tells us, was ‘gander-pulling: a sport that involved tying a goose to a tree,
    greasing its neck, riding past it on horseback, and trying to pull off its head’.
    And then there was the treatment of Black people. White labour was scarce and
    expensive, so George rented enslaved people (‘usually treated moderately well
    and accorded surprising levels of freedom and independence’, according to Lawrence
    Crutcher in his 2012 Life of his great-great-great-grandfather). Then, because
    houses need to be maintained and guests need to be waited on and impressed, the
    Keatses bought enslaved people for their house, the so-called Englishman’s Palace,
    built during one of their periods of prosperity and in successful aid of social
    prominence. George and his wife never loved the people or the place, but they
    loved the money they made there and the prestige that came with it. The children
    grew up as one might expect. Gigante reports the first words of ‘Little Rose’:
    ‘“Hoad yo’ yaw!” she reputedly snapped at the child of the cook. “You’re only
    a knobby-headed niggah anyway.”’'

  zh: 或许在这样的情况下保持清白是不可能的。丑恶深入骨髓，污染了一切。路易斯维尔的一种流行消遣，吉甘特告诉我们，是‘拉雁头’：一项活动涉及将一只鹅绑在树上，涂抹油脂在它的脖子上，骑马经过它，试图拉下它的头。然后就是对待黑人的方式。白人劳工稀缺而昂贵，所以乔治租了奴隶（根据劳伦斯·克鲁切尔在他2012年的《他的曾曾曾祖父的生活》中所说，他们通常受到适度的善待，并被给予惊人的自由和独立）。然后，因为房屋需要维护，客人需要侍候和给予印象，基茨斯为他们的房子购买了奴隶，即所谓的英国人宫殿，在他们繁荣的时期之一建造，在成功地获得社会地位的援助下。乔治和他的妻子从未爱过这里的人或地方，但他们爱上了在那里赚到的钱和随之而来的声望。孩子们长大的方式和人们所预料的一样。吉甘特报道了‘小玫瑰’的第一句话：‘“Hoad
    yo’ yaw！”她据说对厨师的孩子呵斥道。“你只是一个愚蠢的黑鬼而已。”’
- en: George had told Keats and Tom when he left (and perhaps believed it) that he
    was seeking a fortune in America for their sakes. He never saw Tom again; he saw
    Keats only once more, very briefly, on that expensive flying visit to extract
    Tom’s inheritance from Abbey, an achievement that left his brother with nothing
    but debts. He never returned to England. Both Keats and Tom were dead before he
    achieved (briefly) the wealth he craved. Thinking of his assumption that owning
    enslaved people was something forced on him by circumstance, reading the querulous,
    controlling, self-pitying letters he wrote to his sister, Fanny, in later years,
    I found it hard to be convinced that he would have been generous or just to any
    of them. It is similarly hard to believe that his emigration had anything particularly
    remarkable about it. The descriptions of the landscapes through which George and
    his wife passed on their way to Louisville are marvellous; they seem to invite
    us to credit George with an unusually fine eye and an extraordinary capacity for
    appreciation. But they are made by others (Frances Trollope, Dickens, Audubon),

- en: So it is surprising to find that Gigante would have us believe that Keats and
    George were comparable figures, both dreamers, both poets, and Keats no better
    or more imaginative a man than his brother. If making money and sitting on committees
    with other wealthy men is creative, then, in Gigante’s view, George was a poet.
    The false advertisers of the English Prairie where George originally intended
    to settle were poets too, their misrepresentations a ‘poetical romance’ comparable
    to *Endymion* or, in their sublimity, ‘The Fall of Hyperion’. Similarly, when
    Audubon conned George into investing in a steamboat that had already sunk he wasn’t
    lying, Gigante says, but ‘half-perceiving and half-creating the world, which a
    Romantic poet like Wordsworth would have approved’ – a surprising judgment from
    someone who might have been expected to regard literature as different from fraud.
    George lost his fortune as fast as he made it; it rose and fell together with
    the nation’s economy. ‘The truth is that George was never as good a businessman
    as his brother was a poet,’ his otherwise admiring descendant Crutcher admits.

    others have been curious too. So she explains the way words like ‘thou’ were once
    used, tells us what it feels like to have a life mask made (‘a bit tickly and,
    as you can neither scratch your face nor move a muscle, it seems to go on for

    into a virtue because otherwise it is just abuse.’ Nersessian especially admires
    his letters to Brawne. Their passion invites her own; their supremely romantic
    pain proves their emotional truth and purity. The sadistic core of Keats’s relationship
    with Brawne registers with her as full erotic engagement, an enactment of freedom
    in defiance of fear. Beauty, she writes, lies about the fragility of the world;
    perfection is an offence because ‘it needs nothing,’ because it is invulnerable.
    Vulnerability alone, she writes, the painful and ambivalent engagement with ‘the
    push-pull pathology of dread and longing, intimidation and tenderness’, makes
    us worthy of love. Her history of pain, exclusion and abuse makes her an especially
    appropriate interpreter of and respondent to what she believes Keats was offering
    and seeking, for in writing to Brawne, Keats was writing – if only he had known

- en: 'Nersessian is right to point out that Keats was deeply interested in suffering.
    He came by it naturally and also medically; sometimes it appeared as an impulse
    towards poetic tragedy. It is the foundation of the two ‘Hyperion’ poems and a
    reason he could not finish them. He wants what he has always wanted, to soothe
    pain. If he cannot soothe it, he wants to redeem it as creative power. In ‘Hyperion’,
    the record of his first major attempt to derive art from witnessed suffering,
    ‘Names, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,/Majesties, sovran voices,
    agonies,/Creations and destroyings’ stream from Mnemosyne’s brain into Apollo’s,
    but the poem halts at the paroxysm that marks the spot for the apotheosis that
    never quite happens. If he cannot transmute disaster into creative power, he wants
    to take through sympathetic witness its stunning, time-destroying pressure on
    himself; but to share another’s pain is not necessarily to relieve the sufferer.
    In ‘The Fall of Hyperion’, Moneta accedes to the poet’s wish to ‘behold … What
    in [her] brain so ferments to and fro’. He watches ‘Without stay or prop/But [his]
    own weak mortality’; frozen, his brain burning, he bears ‘The load of [the] eternal
    quietude’ in which Saturn and Thea, ‘Like sculpture builded up upon the grave/Of
    their own power’, bow towards the earth. There is no comfort for them. Their fall
    from power has reduced them to art. The moon waxes and wanes and waxes and wanes

  zh: 诗人必须面对这样一个可能性，即他所能做的或所遭受的一切-不是见证，不是同情，也不是诗歌-都不能安慰那些受苦者。他自己的痛苦无关紧要。
- en: Nersessian’s Keats is interested in pain not as a problem he must solve (even
    though he cannot) but as a responsibility and a temptation he morally and politically
    fails. The ‘perfect and unforgiveable’ ode ‘To Autumn’ offends her (and not her
    alone) by having been written not about those who had died a month before in the
    Peterloo Massacre but about or out of a cessation of resistance to the death none
    of us escapes. Her Keats is not a healer, not even a failed one; he is a thug.
    Ignoring not just the ‘Hyperion’ poems but the masochistic and sadomasochistic
    ‘Lamia’ (‘She burnt, she lov’d the tyranny’), she reads the odes as scenes of
    suffering and as provocations to violence, which is to be welcomed as inviting
    retaliation.

  zh: 尼尔塞辛的凯茨对痛苦感兴趣，并不是因为他必须解决的问题（尽管他无法解决），而是因为他在道德和政治上的失败，是一种责任和诱惑。令她（不仅仅是她一个人）感到愤慨的《致秋天》一诗，不是因为它是关于一个月前在彼得卢大屠杀中死去的人，而是因为它是关于或源于我们都逃不过的死亡的抵抗的停止。她的凯茨不是治疗者，甚至不是一个失败的治疗者；他是一个暴徒。忽视不仅是《超级神》诗歌，而且是自虐和虐待狂的《拉米亚》（“她烧了，她爱上了暴政”），她将这些颂歌解读为受苦的场景，并将其视为暴力的挑衅，这是值得欢迎的，因为它邀请报复。
- en: 'It requires a good deal of twisting to bring out the odes’ hostility. In ‘Ode
    to a Nightingale’ she hears ‘less of a confession than a dare, not far off from
    a *fuck you*’. To her the greeting of the spirit that opens ‘Ode on a Grecian
    Urn’ (‘Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,/Thou foster-child of silence
    and slow time’) ‘sounds like an assault’ because it is not preceded by an ‘O’
    and therefore shows a lack of respect. Indeed, by calling the urn ‘still unravish’d’,
    the speaker gives away his intent: to force himself on it, overcoming its cool
    virginal resistance to his penetration. What others hear as a ceremonial naming
    of genealogical virtues she hears as a threat and a rehearsal of brutality: ‘This
    is more of a hey-you or a catcall and, like a catcall, it has an air of substantial
    menace. It also carries a cry of pain, the *ow* in *Thou*, a name spun around
    a moan.’ That the opening lines are in the second person and not in the first
    means, she says, that the speaker recognises the urn as ‘an other’, which means
    he is hostile, means his address is ‘an act of aggression. If this poem were a
    street,’ she continues, ‘you would hope to avoid walking down it.’'

  zh: 为了表达出颂歌的敌意，需要做出很大的扭曲。在《夜莺颂》中，她听到的是“不是自白，而是一个挑衅，离一个*操你*不远”。对于开篇的灵感，她听到的是“一种袭击”，因为它没有以“O”开头，因此显示出不尊重。事实上，通过称呼花瓶为“依旧未被掳走”，说话者暴露了他的意图：强迫自己，克服它冷漠处女般的对他的贯穿的抵抗。别人听到的是一种典礼性的基因特征的命名，她听到的是一种威胁和残暴的排练：“这更像是一个嘿，你，或者一个招手，就像一个招手一样，带有实质性的威胁。它还带着一声痛苦的呼喊，在*Thou*中的*ow*，一个围绕呻吟的名字。”开篇的这一事实是在第二人称而不是第一人称，她说，这意味着说话者将花瓶视为“另一个”，这意味着他是敌对的，意味着他的讲话是“一种攻击行为。如果这首诗是一条街道，”她继续说，“你会希望避免走在它上面。”
- en: 'To this​ I say, wishing I were anywhere but on the street that is this argument,
    that if you had to address everyone you met as ‘I’ rather than ‘you’ in order
    to avoid antagonising them, your conversation would quickly become unmanageable.
    I wasn’t aware that an ode that begins with a ‘Thou’ and not an ‘O’ was an insult.
    Nothing requires an ode to open with ‘O’: Ben Jonson didn’t recognise any such
    rule; neither did Thomas Gray, or Spenser, or Dryden, or Marvell, or Coleridge,
    or Pindar. The vocative doesn’t require an ‘O’. If there is a catcall or a ‘fuck
    you’ here, it isn’t coming from the odes.'

  zh: 对此，我说，我希望自己不在这场争论中，如果你不得不把你遇到的每个人都称为“我”，而不是“你”，以避免激怒他们，你的谈话很快就会变得难以管理。我没有意识到一个以“Thou”而不是“O”开头的颂歌是一种侮辱。没有什么需要颂歌以“O”开头：本·琼森没有认识到任何这样的规则；托马斯·格雷、斯宾塞、德莱顿、马尔维尔、柯勒律治、品达尔都没有认识到。叫唤词不需要以“O”开头。如果这里有一声喊叫或者一声“操你”，那不是来自颂歌。

    and fragments of conversations, about dreams in which protection is indistinguishable
    from attack, about dick pics sent by an old lover who ‘vows to slap me and stuff
    my shirt into my mouth’, a threat that ‘loosens the secret of that relationship,

- en: How to address such a claim in public? Nersessian does not have to tell us anything
    about herself, but she does, enough to raise the questions she then refuses to
    address. She speaks of herself as private, but it is not privacy that she uses,
    it is power – the power to display and to withhold. It is clear only that she
    is daring her readers to call her out on what she is doing. We cannot, though,
    because though her subject is ostensibly in the realm of public discourse, it
    is mined with private, secret things, some of them (like the passage above) clearly
    marked as such. It would be a violation of her and others’ privacy to ask what
    any of this means. Why then does she set this before the public eye?

  zh: 如何在公共场合处理这样的说法？内尔赛辛不必告诉我们任何关于她自己的事情，但她确实说了，足以引发她后来拒绝回答的问题。她把自己描述为私人的，但她使用的不是私密性，而是权力——展示和隐瞒的权力。只有明显的是，她在挑战她的读者指责她在做什么。我们却无法这样做，因为虽然她的主题表面上属于公共话语领域，但它却充斥着私人的、秘密的事物，其中一些（如上文所述）明确标记为私密。问这一切意味着什么，将是对她和其他人隐私的侵犯。那么为什么她要把这个放在公众眼前呢？
- en: Although Nersessian writes with indignation about the abuse she imagines the
    speaker of the ‘Ode on a Grecian Urn’ inflicts on the urn, pointing out with horror
    the implications of its invocation of the ‘unravish’d bride’ and noting that the
    ode ‘is a poem about poetry’s long involvement in a cultural tradition that takes
    sexual violence to be an especially rich source of inspiration for art’, she herself
    behaves before the reader like a maiden loth fleeing her readerly pursuer. But
    is she fleeing or is she, wilfully provocative, inviting pursuit? Having gone
    out of her way to invite curiosity about her enigmas, that is, will she judge
    that curiosity as inappropriate, as a violation akin to rape?

- en: Perhaps there is something essential about that thorn in her finger or the circumstances
    around that day in the woods that her refusal to explain prevents us from understanding,
    or, since not everything in this volume behaves quite this perversely, perhaps
    not. It is impossible to guess. We don’t know the stakes. But she also tells us
    a story we know matters quite a lot. She tells it almost sufficiently, tacitly
    inviting the reader to fill in the gaps. Once, in high school, she had been a
    precocious student of Latin literature, which she loved. Then her Latin teacher,
    ‘a self-satisfied bozo with thick fingers and a comically deep voice’, began paying
    her sexual attention. When she refused him, he turned vengeful. She went to the
    headmistress to complain about his lascivious demands, unwarranted low marks and
    screaming. The headmistress threatened her. She was expelled from Latin class.

- en: 'Perhaps to assume that Keats’s odes are the real subject of all this is an
    error. Perhaps to assume they never were is a worse error. Perhaps it is the not-telling
    that is the point: she remains in complete control of her meaning. Little of this
    is clear, and anything that seems clear, that seems at least to be important,
    soon shows itself to be unreliable. (I am thinking of the objectionable absence
    of the ‘O’ and so on; I do not doubt the reality of her high school harassment.)
    What shocks me in all this, however, is the teasing of the reader, which doubles
    the hyperbolic provocation she has both discussed and, if we are to believe her,
    enacted in her relationships. Her daring the reader to notice feels like one of
    the catcalls or ‘fuck you’s she says she hears in the odes: it feels like a provocation
    designed to draw an assault that is meant to justify a striking back. She seems,
    as the phrase goes, to be asking for it. But how appalling to suggest such a thing.
    (Look what you made me do.) It is rude to comment on it, because it is private;
    it is repellent to comment on it because it uses the abuser’s logic; and it is
    dangerous to comment on it, because, as teasing, it has the structure of a trap.
