    $5,591,406 [in 2021](https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2021/mozilla-fdn-990-ty21-public-disclosure.pdf)

    AI and social networks, although warns that Mozilla.social is unlikely to move
    beyond the experimentation phase in 2024\. He says that Mozilla would be "exploring
    ways to better integrate advertising while adhering to our focus on privacy and
    choice," including web browsing.

    in prototyping, launching, learning, and iterating ... This requires rich data,
    and so we will be moving in that direction, but in a very Mozilla way."'
