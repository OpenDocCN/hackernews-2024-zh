- en: The long-awaited nomination statistics for the 2023 Hugo Awards have finally
    been published – at the last possible moment according to the WSFS constitution
    (and at a point when I really don’t have time for Hugo neepery). The voting statistics
    already came out sometimes in December and it turned out that several finalists
    won with very large majorities.

    admin was very busy with his day job” is the only reason the stats were delayed
    for so long.'

- en: The first landmine is lurking in Best Novel, because it turns out that *Babel*
    by R.F. Kuang, whose absence from the ballot was very notable, since pretty much
    everybody expected it to be nominated, started out with the third most nominations,
    but was knocked out by EPH on the final round (which it shouldn’t have been) and
    also declared ineligible. *Babel* was published in the US on September 1, 2022,
    it didn’t have any prior publication elsewhere and it’s obviously SFF, so how
    can it be ineligible?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The EPH data is also weird, because *Babel* doesn’t gain any points throughout,
    as the other nominees are eliminated, which is extremely unusual. Of course, most
    of the longlist is made up of Chinese novels, where there may be little overlap
    with western ballots, but I imagine that at least some of the 115 people who nominated
    *The Mountain in the Sea* by Ray Nayler (another likely finalist conspicuous by
    its absence) or some of the 78 people who nominated *A Half-Built Garden* by Ruthanna
    Emrys (which surprised me a little, though it’s a pleasant surprise) would have
    also nominated *Babel*. Also, it would be great if the stats listed at least the
    authors, because it’s annoying trying to google some of these works.

    than the more obscure *A Half-Built Garden.*

    the finalist which made the ballot instead of *Babel*, because I bounced off R.F.
    Kuang’s *Poppy War* trilogy really hard. But this does not change the fact that
    *Babel* was obviously eligible and should have made the ballot. And we really
    need an explanation why it was declared ineligible.
  prefs: []

    is the sharp drop-off in nominations. The top seven nominees – i.e. the six finalists
    plus Babel – received between 831 and 767 nominations. This number is much higher
    than usual, but then we had an influx of Chinese nominators and therefore more
    nomination ballots. However, the eighth place nominee, a Chinese novel entitled
    *Age of the Godmakers* (I couldn’t find out the author or anything else about
    this one) only got 150 nominations, 617 less than *The Daughter of Doctor Moreau*.
    This is a massive drop-off and extremely unusual.

    Mirror Mended* by Alix E. Harrow with 615 nominations, and place 6, *What Moves
    the Dead* by T. Kingfisher with 155 nominations. The longlist consists mainly

    many nominations as the second place finalist. It’s clear that “The Space Time
    Painter” is a story which really spoke to the Chinese fans nominating, especially
    since it also referred to a famous Chinese painting. We also have a Chinese novelette
    called “Color the World” declared ineligible, according to Neil Clarke, because
    it was published in the wrong year, i.e. it really is ineligible. We also have
    another case of a nomination declined for “Two Hands Wrapped in Gold” by S.B.
    Divya, [who went public about declining the nomination for political reasons several
    months ago](https://sbdivya.com/fwords/2023/6/29/withdrawing-from-hugo-nominations).

    care for, was actually leading in nominations, followed by “Rabbit Test” by Samatha
    Mills, a story which spoke very much to US voters due to the repeal of Roe vs.
    Wade. We have another story, “Fogong Temple Pagoda” by Hai Ya (also found in [this
    anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Awards-Chinese-Science-Anthology/dp/8832077728))
    declared ineligible, which may be another case of prior publication. Though apparently,
    it was a 2022 publication. “Destiny Delayed” by Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki was
    knocked out by EPH in spite of 429 nominations and like *Babel* gained no points
    throughout. However, since the longlist is mostly comprised of Chinese stories,
    where the nominators were likelier to nominate other Chinese stories than a story
    by a Nigerian author that was published in *Asimov’s*, this is likelier than what
    happened with *Babel*.

    whole ballot. The six finalist ranks had between 925 and 816 nominations, whereas
    the seventh placed finalist *The Nsibidi Scripts* a.k.a. the *Akata Trilogy* by
    Nnedi Okorafor had only 52 nominations. I’m sorry, but this pattern is so unlikely
    to have occurred naturally that a meteor strike hitting the convention center
    during the Hugo ceremony is probably more likely.

    running SFF series written by a single author (the first story came out in 1961,
    the last story in 2023, i.e. that’s a whopping 62 years) make the longlist in
    twelfth place, alas with only 27 nominations. I very much championed Elric, because
    there are few people alive who deserve a Hugo more the Michael Moorcock and yet
    never got one. Elric is eligible again in 2024 due to the publication of “The
    Folks in the Forest” in *New Edge Sword and Sorcery* No. 1 (in which I have an

    the *Dune* graphic novel also got the most nominations. These works were on a
    recommendation list by the Chinese magazine *Science Fiction World* and are also
    apparently very popular with Chinese fans. The graphic novel *Across a Field of
    Starlight* by Blue Deliquanti, which actually sounds fascinating and would almost
    certainly have been a better finalist than *Cyberpunk 2077* or *Dune* – again,
    just missed the ballot.'

    because one of the author was on the Hugo committee. This is an absolutely valid
    reason to declare what was likely a worthy finalist ineligible and also appears
    to be a first in Hugo history. Another finalist declared ineligible was *The Art
    of Ghosts of Tsushima*, a video game related art book, due to prior publication
    in English. Nothing questionable about this.

    also turns out that *Prey*, a movie which not only was unexpectedly good but also
    a likely finalist, would have easily made the ballot, but the team behind the
    film decline the nomination. As one of the people who nominated *Prey*, I really
    would like to know why they declined. Political reasons? But then, Hollywood is
    actively chasing the big Chinese market, so that’s rather unlikely. And though
    the Hugos don’t have a lot of clout in Hollywood, I still find it unlikely that
    filmmakers wouldn’t want one, especially since genre films and TV shows are regularly
    snubbed at the major film and TV awards, as this recent round of “Let’s shower
    *Oppenheimer*, *The Holdovers*, *Killers of the Flower Moon*, *Succession*, *The
    Bear* and *Beef* with awards” proves.'

    season 1 of *The Sandman* was also declared ineligible in Best Dramatic Presentation
    Long, because an individual episode got more votes. However, “The Sound of Her
    Wings” not only was absolutely eligible, since it came out on August 5, 2022,
    it also got more than enough votes to make the ballot.

    Best Novel or Best Dramatic Presentation territory. It’s also notable that Carl

    for sure what happened. And this is why we need answers and an explanation and
    we need it now. The people who were randomly declared ineligible needs answers
    and the finalists who made the ballot or won also need answers, because this is
    tainting their nominations and wins as well, if they don’t know if they really
    made the ballot or won organically.

    be contacted and given the chance to clarify their eligibility.

    western Europe corridor, potential bidders need to accept that local politics,
    preferences and censorship should not influence the Hugo ballot. I don’t care
    if Uganda or Florida (or Hungary or Russia) get their knickers in a twist about
    LGBTQ finalists or if Israel gets their knickers in a twist over Palestinian finalists
    or if a Muslim majority country gets its knickers in a twist over Jewish finalists.
    Your country’s politics, whatever they are, should not influence the Hugo ballot.
    Any potential bidder needs to accept this or they can’t host a Worldcon. And yes,
    I feel sorry for countries with shitty politics and shitty governments (which
    includes western countries at times), but in this case, I care more about the
    integrity of the Hugo Awards.

    or non-traditional bid (mainly Uganda at this point, since Egypt withdrew and
    the Tel Aviv bid seems to be dead for all intents and purposes) to ever win a
    Worldcon again. This is also a slap in the face for those of us who defended Chengdu,
    so thanks a lot.

    ballot and now question their nominations. And this is something no Hugo finalist

    was nominated was at the start of the covid pandemic and I suspected that I only
    made the ballot because all twenty people who would have been ahead of me had
    declined for fear of catching covid at the con (it turned out no one had declined
    and I won the fifth highest number of nominations) – so doing this to Hugo finalists
    and winners is just cruel, because many of us are already insecure enough.

    He also responds to calls for the 2023 Hugo winners to return their trophies (most

    or winners to recuse themselves, walk out or return their trophies, usually from
    people who’ve never been within spitting distance of a Hugo trophy. But this is
    a call that every finalist must make for themselves and the rest of us must accept

    but that means things like traditional room and bid parties being difficult to
    do in Helsinki, because Finland (and all of Scandinavia actually) is really weird
    about alcohol, or how Ireland’s strict fire codes affected queuing for panels
    at the Dublin Worldcon. It should not mean that finalists are randomly declared
    ineligible, because someone fears they might not be appropriate. Though McCarty’s
    statements strongly imply that we are dealing with pre-emptive self-censorship
    here rather than actual government pressure. He also appears to be afraid that
    saying more will make his Chinese colleagues look bad. Though at this point, I
    don’t think that there’s anything that can make them worse than they already look.
    Never mind that Chinese fans are as angry about the way the Chengdu Worldcon and
    the Hugos went as western fans.
