    successfully miniaturized atomic energy batteries, which measure less than a coin
    at 15 x 15 x 5mm. The compact battery uses the radioactive isotope Nickel 63 to
    generate 100 microwatts and a voltage of 3V of electricity through the process
    of radioactive decay.'

    them for commercial devices like phones and drones, but also states nuclear batteries
    could be used for aerospace equipment, AI, medical equipment, advanced sensors,
    and micro-robots. The Beijing-based company claims to have drawn inspiration from
    devices such as pacemakers, and satellites.

    And while it still has some way to go, the company seems confident stating development
    is way ahead of European and American scientific research institutions and enterprises.

    is a radiactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors
    as energy converters.

    due to the negative connotations of nuclear tragedies like the Chernobyl disaster
