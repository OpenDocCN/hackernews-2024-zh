    to understand for newbies, but still infinitely customisable through plugins and
    scripts for power users.

- en: Mnemosyne uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time for a card
    to come up for review. Difficult cards that you tend to forget quickly will be
    scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't waste your time on things you remember
    well.

- en: If you want, anonymous statistics on your learning process can be uploaded to
    a central server for analysis. This data will be valuable to study the behaviour
    of our memory over a very long time period. The results will be used to improve
    the scheduling algorithms behind the software even further.
