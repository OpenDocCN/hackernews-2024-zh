    consumer, purchased and key it into the register. This took skill but also time—and
    proved to be an imperfect way to keep track of inventory. Then one day, a group
    of grocery executives and inventors came up with a better way: what we now know
    as the barcode, a rectangle that marks items ranging from insulin to Doritos.
    It’s so ubiquitous and long-lived that it’s become invisible.'
