    consumer, purchased and key it into the register. This took skill but also time—and
    proved to be an imperfect way to keep track of inventory. Then one day, a group
    of grocery executives and inventors came up with a better way: what we now know
    as the barcode, a rectangle that marks items ranging from insulin to Doritos.
    It’s so ubiquitous and long-lived that it’s become invisible.'

    code, my phone crashed. But then, when I got it up again, it scanned the code
    in a second. So technology today is just, like, not as reliable as this simple,

    and consumerism as we now know it, in the sense that it is the thing that makes
    modern shopping work, even if we don’t always see it or think about it. All the
    megastores that we now know—whether that’s, like, a Walmart Supercenter or a Costco—all
    these megastores, and even the era that has followed, which is Amazon, that’s
    only possible because of the barcode.'

    barcode start?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    think about the place you go where you do the most scanning of products. Go to
    any grocery store: It’s just sort of a chorus of beeps.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    universal symbol for the grocery industry, just a way for them to keep track of
    all products—whether that was in, you know, one grocery store or another—and to
    just scan things more quickly. The idea of taking that symbol and those scanners
    and applying them beyond the grocery industry, to every other store that we now
    see these codes in, was totally inconceivable to everyone who invented the barcode.
  prefs: []

    was invented. But before we do that, can you just explain what the pre-barcode
    world looked like?'
  prefs: []

    era was lots of clicking. And so that’s all because you would have to put a sticker
    price on every single product. And so just think about all the work that would
    entail. So there would be a price gun that someone would constantly have to be
    changing to the specific price and have to be sort of stamping on products all
    the time, all day long, just to keep up with all the products in the store.'

    Click for Pop-Tarts. Older products might still be there, or something might be
    priced incorrectly, because everything needed a sticker price. So there was a
    lot of inaccuracy and inefficiency in that way.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Desai:** So, starting in the early ’70s, this group of grocery execs—it was,
    you know, basically everyone that was involved in the products themselves and
    getting them to your grocery store—they all came together and decided that they
    were going to work together to create a universal way to identify every product
    in every grocery store. Sort of the same way, you know, a seven-digit phone number
    calls up a certain person, the idea was that a 12-digit UPC code would just identify
    any particular item, right?'
  prefs: []

    every single product—like, every fruit, everything—would have its own particular
    marker? Or did they think, *Oh no. It’s just like a phone number. No big deal*?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a year to devise. And then from there, it took like two years to create a symbol

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    individual company profit off of a barcode, then that would really be a huge impediment
    to this actually becoming universal. And obviously the whole idea of a universal
    product code is that it’s universal. So what they did is they chose seven finalists—seven
    companies—that would create a code in a way for it to be scanned, and none of
    these companies would get any sort of profits off of it.'

    completely logical when you explain it, that they should come up with a reason
    why this thing would be widely accepted, and that reason is sort of Marxist. You
    know, like, nobody’s going to profit off of it specifically.'

    ’60s and ’50s in a sense that it just feels so divorced and different from how
    we think about American business and technology today. Obviously, if the same
    sort of process played out today, it is really, really hard to envision a world
    in which an individual person didn’t get super rich. Like, there would be an Elon
    Musk of barcodes.'

    rectangular one?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    zebra-striped code of black-and-white lines. But for a while, it really seemed
    like the most promising symbol was from the company RCA, which actually already
    piloted that barcode at a store, and it was the first barcode to ever be patented.
    And it sort of looks like a bullseye. So it’s round, and it’s different circles
    of varying thickness in sort of concentric circles.'

    just the usual black-and-white stripes, is very uncanny to me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Rosin:** Can you describe them? I’m looking them all up. Okay, so we have
    the bullseye one, the RCA one. The one that looks like a sun is actually beautiful.
    And there’s one like a rainbow, which is beautiful. And I kind of like the ones
    that look like music symbols, you know. We ended up with the most boring one—maybe
    the most practical, but definitely, visually, the most boring one is the one that
    is ubiquitous.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Desai:** So, basically, the invention of the barcodes is delightfully ’70s
    and terrible ’70s at the same time. Right? So they couldn’t decide between the
    IBM zebra-stripe barcode and all the other various barcodes that we’ve been talking
    about. And, you know, this was a really divisive, ongoing discussion. And to sort
    of lighten the mood, one of the core figures in this collection of various, like,
    grocery-store executives decided to take the whole committee to see *Deep Throat*
    at a San Francisco porn theater, basically. And it was soon after that they decided
    to pick the IBM barcode. As if the invention of the barcode couldn’t get any more
    ’70s, I think this is sort of the cherry on top.'

    they were all men.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    think they had any idea of the numbers of enormous changes that would follow because
    of the barcode?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    because that was the whole idea, right? Like, it was intended to just be a really
    industry-specific and focused thing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they never really contemplated the idea that, you know, everything could
    use or could get a barcode. And so, you know, there was some prediction at the
    time that only like 10,000 companies would ever really use this UPC barcode. And
    now, like 10,000 UPC barcodes get scanned every second.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Rosin:** Oh my God. That’s insane. So what did happen? Like, what actually
    changed?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Desai:** Yeah, so once the barcode arrives, stores can more easily figure
    out exactly what is selling and what isn’t. And what that does, it seems very
    simple to us now, but it lets them try out new products more easily, right? Because
    if you buy, say, a new type of mustard, right?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Desai:** If you can more easily know whether it’s selling or not, it makes
    it easier to sort of just test out a product. And if you’re thinking about the
    cashier, you know, keying in all the products on a big, hulking mechanical cash
    register, if you turn all of that into a barcode that just needs to be scanned,
    you can add an infinite number of items in a store, and it doesn’t really change
    anything for a cashier, right? They don’t need to know any more information about
    the products. They just put it over the barcode, and they put it in your bag,
    and that’s it.'

    moment, when they’re probably just so excited about all the possibility, and then
    come tumbling all the horrors: our addiction to it, our addiction to efficiency.
    Is that what happened? Like, was this the beginning of it all?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the Oppenheimers of capitalism, really. Because it is sort of like that, right?
    In a sense, America has B.C. and A.D., which is before codes and, you know, after
    *Deep Throat*, for lack of a better phrase.'

    we had something there. But I really do think that’s the story of American business,
    in a sense.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    many products, arguably too many products, right? It can be exhausting sometimes.
    Like, I went to Whole Foods, and there’s 23 types of mustard jars on the shelves
    at my local Whole Foods, which is sort of crazy and incredible, right? Like, anything
    you now want, you can get, and that’s great in a sense, and that’s also terrible
    in a sense, you know? That level of choice can be paralyzing. And the efficiency
    that the barcode has unfurled has also led to the era of fast fashion and mindless
    junk and, you know, even just corporate bigness, right? These scanners were really
    expensive, so it was the biggest companies that got in on them first and were
    able to just speed up their operations.

    of downstream, people got rich off the barcode, right?'
  prefs: []

    something that made lots of people rich. The era of big-box stores and megastores
    and Costcos the size of medieval European towns, or whatever, is all only possible
    because of a barcode, which lets you track all these products more easily and
    know what’s selling and what isn’t, and lets cashiers scan all the stuff way more
    efficiently. So in that sense, it really has abetted the rise of megastores, and
    it has definitely been a vehicle for people in corporate America to get really
    rich.'

    of like the government of barcodes, right? So if you create a new product and
    you want a UPC code for that product, you go to GS1 and they will assign you a
    UPC code.
  prefs: []

    you can basically just put a QR code on products.
  prefs: []

    it just pulls up a URL. But these QR codes are sort of different from that, in
    the sense that you can scan them, but they also will beep at a cash register and
    contain lots of data within them that’s not just a link. So they’re sort of like—they
    have two roles in that way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    was stuck on, like, the experience of being at a restaurant and everyone scanning
    the QR code and how totally annoying it is because the Wi-Fi does or doesn’t work
    in the restaurant and all of that. So I couldn’t tell if what you were saying
    was good or bad for me, the consumer.'

    was not supposed to just be something that you scan with your phone to pull up
    a link. The idea was just instead of, like, 12 numbers that can be included in
    a UPC code, a QR code can include over 4,000 characters, right? So both numbers,
    letters, exclamation points, periods—anything like that, right?'

    code can contain way more information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what that allows is, for example, right, if you have jugs of milk in a store
    that are like two days away from expiring, the store will automatically be able
    to discount those. So it will allow more efficiency in a store’s inventory in
    a way that is actually helpful, in a sense, for us consumers. But also the current
    barcode has sort of no role for us as consumers, because we can’t really do anything
    with it. So it’s potentially helpful to replace it with something that we can
    all actually scan.

    a product, it’s possible it could ping you to tell you that it has trace amounts
    of peanuts and that you shouldn’t buy it. That happens both if you’re using your
    phone—so you’re connected to the Kroger app—or even possibly if you’re just scanning
    your stuff at a checkout counter. Say you scanned your loyalty card information
    so they know who you are, and if you’ve already told Kroger online that you’re
    allergic to peanuts, because information about allergens is baked into this new
    QR code, it’s possible that it could tell you right then not to buy that product.

    to have more information for a product. But when you got to the part about the
    peanuts is where my vigilance went up, because I thought, *Okay. Yes, we as a
    consumer are going to get more information, but we are definitely going to pay
    a price*. Because I think of a QR code: Unlike a barcode, I’m scanning it and
    it’s scanning me. Like, I’m giving up something with a QR code that I feel like
    I’m not giving up with a barcode.'

    *app*. That’s the problem. The issue is, basically, so much of American capitalism
    now is data harvesting and targeted advertising.'

    that trajectory as well. So say we go to Levi’s and there’s a pair of jeans you
    want. You could scan the code and it will probably tell you to download the Levi’s
    app.'

    right? Say you decide it’s too expensive. Because the company now has this data,
    that you scanned the QR code of this pair of jeans, they could very easily send
    you a 15-percent-off code in your email, the same way that if you leave a product
    in your online cart—everyone’s sort of familiar with, like, leave it there long
    enough and you’ll get like a code, like, *Please come back. Here’s a small discount*.
    It’s like the physical version of that, which is really sort of creepy to me.

    Before I get home from the store, there’ll be a Levi’s catalog in my mailbox,
    which turns all of us into targetable commodities.'

    knows where in a store you are scanning that.'

    by Crest, or whatever, and you scan that versus the one that’s exactly the same
    on a shelf in the back, the store will immediately know that.

    just more data about us all is, to me, the most disheartening aspect of this transformation.

    what is coming for us? Like, for all I know, QR codes are already defunct.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Desai:** They’re not already defunct, but they are very, very antiquated.
    The QR code was invented in Japan in the early ’90s, mostly for the automotive
    industry, actually. And so it’s been around for quite some time. And, obviously,
    technology has changed a lot in [30] years.'

- en: And, you know, the QR code is the near future, but only the near future. In
    the same way that the UPC code lasted 50 years, we’re turning to the QR code,
    but there’s no way in hell it’s going to last 50 years. It’s sort of like the
    way that everyone gets a new iPhone every two years or three years, or whatever.
    Once you move into that mode of constantly updating things, it’s going to change
    and not last for many decades and lead to the same sort of familiarity that people
    now associate with a UPC code.

    about the barcode, even with the many evils that it ushered in, with some kind
    of fond nostalgia—because it’s stuck around long enough to become part of the
    background of our lives. And now we’re gonna be constantly bombarded with new
    innovations that we can’t quite keep up with, and we don’t quite know what they’re
    doing or how they’re harvesting information, so it’s a much more disorienting
    world. Like, it sounds like none of these will we become attached to as consumers
    or just humans.'

- en: '**Desai:** I think that’s totally right. Amazon, for example, is really trying
    to use AI now to scan products—like, a type of AI camera that can just understand
    the shape and color and text on a package and just know what it is immediately,
    which is much faster than scanning a code. So there’s definitely a future here
    in which the QR code persists for a few years, but it’s going to be disrupted
    because that’s the story of technology now, right?'

    me about that is if we see it less often, maybe we’ll actually admire and appreciate
    it. Because I don’t think, until I started thinking and reporting the story, I
    really noticed the barcode at all or really appreciated it. But I think in a world
    in which we see this familiar barcode 50 percent less frequently, I think we’re
    more likely to actually give it some thought and to appreciate the degree to which
    it has just withstood 50 years, unlike every other aspect of American technology.
