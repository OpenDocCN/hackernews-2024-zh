- en: The Big Ring was identified by Alexia Lopez, a PhD student at the University
    of Central Lancashire (UCLan), who also discovered the Giant Arc - a structure
    spanning 3.3bn light-years of space.

    I do have to pinch myself, because I made these discoveries accidentally, they
    were serendipitous discoveries. But it is a big thing and I can''t believe that
    I''m talking about it, I don''t believe that it''s me'

    constellation of Bootes the Herdsman.

    said the likelihood of this occurring is vanishingly small so the two objects
    might be related and form an even larger structure.

    structures so instead the authors speculate that we are seeing a relic from the
    early universe where waves of high and low density material are ''frozen'' in
    to extragalactic medium."'

    such as the Sloan Great Wall, which is around 1.5 billion light-years in length,
    and the South Pole Wall, which stretches 1.4 billion light-years across.

    galaxies called the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, which is about 10 billion
    light-years wide.

    Ms Lopez suggests it has more of a coil shape - like a corkscrew - with its face
    aligned with Earth.
