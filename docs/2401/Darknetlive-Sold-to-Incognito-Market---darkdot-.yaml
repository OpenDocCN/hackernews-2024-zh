    the news site [Darknetlive](https://darknetlive.com) in November 2022\. They have
    since used it to suppress criticism and steer public perception in their favor.
    This shift in ownership is chilling Tor journalism, ensuring that an invaluable
    publication will one day be seized and censored by government: [DeepDotWeb’s history

    six years. When it was seized by the USA’s FBI all of its articles were removed

    admins were arrested a year later, over a hundred articles were published.
