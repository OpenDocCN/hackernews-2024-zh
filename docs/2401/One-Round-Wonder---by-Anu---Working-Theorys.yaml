    a new startup archetype that combines*  *big tech know-how and ambition with small
    business principles. Importantly, the SVSB isn’t about small outcomes; it’s a
    set of principles for any size outcome. One of the principles is about not relying
    on outside funding by default, yet not dismissing it entirely. I explore this
    idea in greater detail in this essay.*'

    one more. This is the essence of the traditional venture-funded startup path.

    success, with zero funding rounds and little pomp and circumstance.

    of both bootstrapped and venture funded paths? And can it be done with intention?

    faster without introducing existential financial risk. Financial stability tempers
    founder urgency and stress. I think of the 3 key tangible benefits as:'

    connection away. Community helps find advisors, employees, and critical early
    customers (e.g. the famed YC B2B SaaS startup ecosystem). Support for raising
    “follow on” rounds isn’t a key focus here.'

    and reputation of investors. Credibility is about being able to be trusted and
    believed in — by potential customers, employees, investors. Successfully raising
    and from reputed investors helps with all of these short-term.'

    of funding? Not much! It’s mostly about intention and understanding the ROI of
    each of these benefits at every scale of funding.

    with as much high slope potential as possible. The aspiration of the one-round
    wonder is to use a strategic, single round of funding to achieve this!

    Seed rounds today look like series A’s from a decade ago. And pre-seed rounds,
    more common now, look like the seed rounds of the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    some suggest closer to $1M. The median and average seed round in 2014 was ~ $400K
    and $800K respectively per [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/seed-series-a-funding-charts-2023/);
    these peaked in 2022 with the median seed at $2.5M and the average seed at $3.7M
    (shown above). And among select large VC funds [only](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/seed-funding-startups-top-vc-firms-a16z-nea-khosla/),
    the numbers are higher still — $4M median and $4.6M average seed by 2020\. In
    2024 of course, these figures should be lower.

    $100K = $1M. The high end is 10 times $5M = $50M.** That’s a *big* difference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Granted the investors giving you a $100K check vs. a $5M check will differ,
    but it’s still about multiples. And it still takes a very different product, team,
    business plan, and level of execution to hit one target versus the other.

    based on projected revenue and profit potential (and therefore the outcome).

    you take just $100K, you can cover some operating expenses, but you can’t pay
    yourself. If you take $250K, you can cover opex and a low salary of ~$50K each
    if needed. With $500K, you can take closer to market salary (e.g. $80K) and also
    have more budget to experiment and hire. Imagine you have 3 founders and you may
    want to hire an employee — anything below $500K seems untenable.

    beta tested, and signed paying customers. You want to double down now, but despite
    a bit of revenue coming in, you’re still hitting financial and time constraints.
    You could raise $500K to ease these burdens. But what if you’re ready to lean
    in more? If you raise $1-2M, you can afford to pay yourselves, hire high-leverage
    employees, and invest in growth experiments.

    combinations of circumstances. Just change the location, sector, business model,
    number of founders, their experience level, personal savings, etc. — any one of
    these can massively impact what is “right.” And there’s the impact of cost innovation
    in your industry (and AI will impact most tech or tech-enabled fields).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In my opinion, less than $500K is only the “right” amount if you already have
    money you’re comfortable spending, you have revenue with enough margin to cover
    most expenses, and/or it’s a straight execution play with a very tight plan.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My thought-partner in crime, a former YC founder, read a draft of this essay
    and had a great question — *is $100K actually too little given YC started with
    $125K?* My answer is yes, it’s great for 3-6 months and you can stretch it if
    you suffer a bit, but the goal was usually to raise post-YC. Notably, YC now offers
    a total $500K.

    you’re still tight on cash and it’s distracting and draining to potentially raise
    again.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would you spend more on? Usually it’s labor. And when or why would you
    want to last longer? This one’s self-explanatory, but tactically it gives you
    more time to iterate and pivot (which I’d find most helpful in high market risk
    categories or those with longer product development and sales cycles).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The risk with raising more than the sweet spot is simply that you need a bigger
    outcome. Using the 10x rule, raising $2M should make you think about a $20M outcome,
    if $2.5M then $25M. These are all non-negligible stepups, so while it’s tough
    to draw a hard line at 2, 2.1, 2.2, etc., it can be a slippery slope.

    and small, early-stage venture capital funds (i.e. pre-seed and seed).** In the
    latter category, we’ll also see VCs try to accommodate alternative funding structures
    to address scenarios where SVSBs become profitable and don’t want or need to exit
    (i.e. revenue share, fixed-multiple return, dividends, royalties). I wrote more
    about this in an expanded essay on the “Silicon Valley Small Business” [here](https://every.to/p/rise-of-the-silicon-valley-small-business).

    Sam Lessin from Slow Ventures affirms the SVSB thesis and the idea of an only-seed-funded
    startup as compelling. It’s true that more than a few VCs are now focusing on
    Seed stage given uncertainty of growth capital markets (and of big outcomes with
    good underlying fundamentals).
  prefs: []

    their intention after raising a traditional venture round. I believe many more
    will *formally* in the coming years. (There’s a lot more to discuss about how
    the funding ecosystem and investment structures may adapt, which kinds of startups
    are best positioned for this, etc. but I’ll save that for a future post!)

    would-be Zuckerberg-esque founders are looking more closely at which types of
    companies they should try to build and how they should fund them, if at all.

    diverged, but there’s a new, convergent aspiration to keep in mind — being a *one-round
