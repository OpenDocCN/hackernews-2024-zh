    a look at what non-technical mitigations game developers are coming up with to
    curb this issue.

    to pay 60EUR for a game is a steep investment, especially if one has to buy it
    again every time they get banned. This of course doesn't apply for free-to-play
    games, but can be emulated by having a cosmetics ecosystem, either to pay for,
    or to grind. The other expensive thing when playing video games is the hardware,
    and bans can be tied to it.

    directly at players level: "Bob was really looking out for others", "Bob was a
    team player", and so on. For negative behaviour, reports don''t have to wait the
    end of the match, players can report cheating, being offensive in the text/voice

    away from toxic behaviours doesn''t reduce the number of players as much as banning
    them outright. It''s nice to see that the video game industry realised that cheating
    and abuses/toxicity could be addressed in similar non-technical ways, and that
    both approaches are complementary. This is a stark contrast to other ones, where
