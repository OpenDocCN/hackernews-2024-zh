    a set of low-level instruction, and avoid “costly” compilation. These days x86/64

    positive impression: WASM mixes lisp-style syntax (for efficient streaming parsing)
    and execution model of stack machine. Unlike canonical stack machines, and unlike
    canonical assembly, WASM allows grouping expressions, e.g.'

    is no `exp`, `log`, let alone `log1p` and alike. Fortunately, there is a WASM
    [implementation](https://gist.github.com/going-digital/02e46c44d89237c07bc99cd440ebfa43)
    of `exp2`/`log2` by Peter Knight.

    as `exp` consumes significant time in C implementation. Alas, in a simple benchmark
    computing just exponents in wasm takes ~1.9 seconds, leaving it behind rust/C.
    For reference, javascript computes the same number of exponents in 0.7 seconds.
    Hence, I take WASM branding of ‘near-native speed’ with a grain of salt, at least
    in the context of number crunching. Hopefully this will improve, but for now WASM
    is out of competition.
