    compliment, not an insult. The island nation is dotted with thousands of boreholes
    drilled deep into the rock to extract geothermal energy. They will soon be joined
    by another, which will be anything but boring. “We are going to drill into a magma
    chamber,” says Hjalti Páll Ingólfsson at the Geothermal Research Cluster (GEORG)
    in Reykjavík. “It’s the first journey to the centre of the Earth,” says his colleague
    Björn Þór Guðmundsson.

    – underground reservoirs of molten rock – lie just a few kilometres below Earth’s
    surface, putting them within reach of modern drills. They occasionally leak magma
    to the surface, where it spews out as lava. That is exactly what was starting
    to happen, to spectacular and devastating effect, around the town of Grindavík
    in southern Iceland, as this story went to press. The trouble is, we don’t normally
    know where magma chambers lie. “No geophysical technique has been shown to satisfactorily
    locate magma reservoirs,” says [John Eichelberger](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/about/our-team/john-eichelberger.php)
    at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

    across a magma chamber and have advanced plans to do the unthinkable and deliberately
    drill into it. The project will do no less than make scientific history, providing
    our first direct opportunity to study the hidden liquid rock that Earth uses to
    build its continents. Along the way, it may also…
