    for a low price of 200k USD. You can not install any arbitrary software there,
    as the architecture is closed. PC with its openness will come in some 30 years.
    For now, you have bought machine, but you are also renting it. Any changes require
    a dedicated team to come to your site. You are also forced to pay constant fee
    every month for the privilege to use the machine.

    you buy a computer and nothing keeps you from doing anything with it.

    credit from a bank. This ensures that no independent store, akin to F-Droid will

    from different stores needs to be the same. So, if you even think of having it
    *also* on Apple App Store, you are forbidden from giving more freedom to a user
    in version sold *outside*.

    on their platform. You may create an independent, non-for-profit store if you
    have enough profits to do that.

    what they do and what they stand for. This is no longer the company I fell in
    love with^(. For some time we’ve been discovering that a single provider shouldn’t
    control the entire chain. Apple became the *worst* enemy when it comes to software
    freedom simply because *they can*. Little by little, they prove Stallman’s take
    ^(is stop on.))
