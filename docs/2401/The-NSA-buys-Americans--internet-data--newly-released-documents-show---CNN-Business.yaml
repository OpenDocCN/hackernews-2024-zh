    commercial data brokers without warrants, intelligence officials disclosed in
    documents made public by a US senator Thursday.

    apps that they use, said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, releasing [newly unclassified
    letters](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/signed_wyden_letter_to_dni_re_nsa_purchase_of_domestic_metadata_and_ftc_order_on_data_brokers_with_attachments.pdf)

    sensitive information about Americans from commercial marketplaces that they would
    otherwise be required to obtain via court order.

    CNN reported earlier this week that the Biden administration is [preparing an
    executive order ](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/politics/biden-administration-foreign-governments-exploiting-personal-data/index.html)meant

    being used outside—and, in certain cases, inside—the United States,” wrote Paul
    Nakasone, the NSA’s director, in a letter to Wyden dated Dec. 11.

    information generated by devices as they use the internet.

    communications, Nakasone wrote, the data is “related to wholly domestic internet
    communications and internet communications where one side of the communication”
    is located inside the United States and the other side is located abroad.

    to include but not limited to inform the Agency’s collection, analysis, and dissemination
    of cyber threat intelligence,” an NSA official said. “At all stages, NSA takes
    steps to minimize the collection of U.S. person information, to include application
    of technical filters.”

    foreign intelligence missions, according to Nakasone’s letter and the NSA official.

    official, Ronald Moultrie, wrote that agencies that purchase the data are responsible
    for complying “with existing law, regulation and policy, including the Fourth

    there were plenty of legitimate uses for netflow data that can help protect organizations

    years pushing to be able to disclose the NSA practice and only succeeded when
    he placed a hold on the nomination of Nakasone’s successor for NSA director, Lt.
    Gen. Timothy Haugh. In a similar disclosure in 2021, Wyden [revealed ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html)that
    the Defense Intelligence Agency had purchased commercially available smartphone
    location data without a warrant.

    urging it to stop the warrantless surveillance of Americans through the purchases

    whose flagrant violations of Americans’ privacy are not just unethical, but illegal,”
    Wyden wrote to Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence.

    data is now a matter of public record, recent actions by the Federal Trade Commission
    (FTC), the primary federal privacy regulator, raise serious questions about the
    legality of this practice,” Wyden added.

    personal data and recommended that US spy agencies catalog and develop procedures

    crack down on data brokers, including [bans on the sale of certain personal information ](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/19/tech/ftc-crackdown-data-inmarket-media/index.html)by
    two companies, InMarket Media and Outlogic, formerly known as X-Mode.

    2022 that could lead to new regulations targeting what agency chair Lina Khan
    has called a “commercial surveillance” industry that profits from lax cybersecurity
    practices and weak restrictions on how consumer data can be collected, shared
    and analyzed.

    any commercially acquired data that does not align with the FTC’s recent crackdowns.
