- en: It seems that The New York Times Company (“The Times”) got fed up with the pace
    of its negotiations with Microsoft and OpenAI over their use of The Times’ content
    for training and running their LLMs. So much so that The Times filed a post-Christmas
    [complaint](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf)
    against the two, likely knowing full well they’d lay waste to the winter vacations
    of hundreds of people working for OpenAI and Microsoft. It might be the most well-known
    AI-related case to date because the case isn’t a class action and the plaintiff
    is globally recognized.

  zh: 看起来《纽约时报》公司（“时报”）对与微软和OpenAI就其使用《时报》内容进行训练和运行LLMs的谈判进展不满。以至于《时报》在圣诞后针对两者提起了[诉讼](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf)，很可能完全意识到他们将毁掉OpenAI和微软数百名员工的寒假。这可能是迄今为止最著名的与AI相关的案件，因为该案不是集体诉讼，原告是全球公认的。

- en: Unlike other complaints, this one doesn’t spend too much time explaining how
    AI models work or teeing up the analogies they plan to use in court. Instead,
    the complaint includes multiple extremely clear-cut examples of the LLMs spitting
    out The Times’ content nearly verbatim or stating bald-faced lies about The Times’
    content. Many of the other complaints admitted they weren’t able to find clear-cut
    examples of infringing output, nebulously resting their claims on the idea that
    all output is, by definition, infringing. Here, Microsoft and OpenAI haven’t just
    used The Times’ content to teach the AI how to communicate, they’ve launched news-specific
    services and features that ingest both archived content and brand new articles
    from The Times. The other plaintiffs also weren’t able to argue that their specific
    content, out of the trillions of pieces of training data in the datasets, was
    particularly important for creating quality AIs. Here, The Times convincingly
    argues that its content was extremely valuable for training the AIs, both because
    of the quantity involved as well as the fact that the training process involved
    instructing the AI to prioritize The Times’ content.

  zh: 与其他抱怨不同，这个抱怨并没有花太多时间解释AI模型的工作原理或者准备在法庭上使用的类比。相反，该投诉书包括多个非常明确的例子，LLM几乎完全照搬了《纽约时报》的内容，或者公然对《纽约时报》的内容撒谎。许多其他抱怨承认他们无法找到侵权输出的明确例子，含糊地把他们的主张放在所有输出都是侵权的概念上。在这里，微软和OpenAI不仅使用《纽约时报》的内容来教导AI如何交流，还推出了特定于新闻的服务和功能，同时吸收了《纽约时报》的存档内容和全新文章。其他原告也无法争辩说，他们的具体内容，在数据集中数万亿条训练数据中，对于创建优质AI至关重要。在这里，《纽约时报》有力地辩称，其内容对于训练AI非常有价值，既因为涉及的数量，也因为训练过程涉及教导AI优先考虑《纽约时报》的内容。
- en: This is probably the strongest AI-related complaint out there. I think it’s
    quite possible that a jury or judge angry at Microsoft and OpenAI for offering
    services that compete with and undercut The Times is more likely to also find
    that the training activities constituted copyright infringement and that the model
    itself is a derivative work of the training data, without thinking too hard about
    a scenario where the ultimate model doesn’t supplant the business or livelihood
    of the copyright holders in the training data. It’s definitely a case where “bad
    facts invite bad law.”

  zh: 这可能是与人工智能相关的最强烈的抱怨之一。我认为，对于微软和OpenAI提供与《纽约时报》竞争并低价竞争的服务而感到愤怒的陪审团或法官更有可能认定培训活动构成侵犯版权，并且模型本身是训练数据的衍生作品，而不必考虑终极模型不取代训练数据中版权持有人的业务或生计的情况。这绝对是一个“恶劣事实引发恶劣法律”的案例。
- en: This case is also notable for the fact that it explicitly goes after the defendants
    for their AIs’ hallucinations. An AI summarizing a news event based on one or
    more news articles opens a Pandora’s box worth of debate about the line between
    uncopyrightable facts and copyrightable expression, as well as how/if those same
    standards should be applied to a computer “reading” the news. But the hallucinations
    aren’t facts; they’re lies. And even if the defendants prevail in arguing that
    the AIs are mostly just providing people with unprotectable facts, there’s very
    little to shield them from liability for the lies, both with respect to trademark
    dilution claims, but also with respect to potential libel or privacy-related claims
    that might be brought by other individuals. Copyright law can forgive a certain
    amount of infringement under certain circumstances but these other areas of law
    are far less flexible.

  zh: 这个案例还值得注意的一点是，它明确针对被告的AI产生的幻觉。一个基于一篇或多篇新闻文章总结新闻事件的AI引发了关于无版权事实和有版权表达之间界限的辩论的潘多拉魔盒，以及如何/是否应该将相同的标准应用于计算机“阅读”新闻。但是这些幻觉不是事实；它们是谎言。即使被告成功地辩称AI大多只是向人们提供不受保护的事实，也很难保护他们免受关于商标侵权的指控，但也很难保护他们免受其他个人可能提出的诽谤或侵犯隐私的指控。版权法可以在某些情况下原谅一定程度的侵权，但这些法律领域的弹性要小得多。
- en: The other really interesting thing about this complaint is the extent to which
    it describes the business of The Times – how much work the journalists put in
    to create the articles, the physical risks they take during reporting, the value
    of good journalism in general, and The Times’ struggle with adjusting to an online
    world. The complaint paints a picture of an honorable industry repeatedly pants-ed
    by the tech industry, which historically has only come to heel under enormous
    public pressure and the Herculean efforts of The Times to continue to survive.
    It’s interesting because US copyright law decisively rejects the idea that copyright
    protection is due for what is commonly referred to as “sweat of the brow.” In
    other words, the fact that it takes great effort or resources to compile certain
    information (like a phonebook), doesn’t entitle that work to any copyright protection
    – others may use it freely. And where there is copyrightable expression, the difficulty
    in creating it is irrelevant. So, is all this background aimed solely at supporting
    the unfair competition claim? Is it a quiet way of asking the court to ignore
    the “sweat of the brow” precedent, to the extent that it’s ultimately argued by
    the defendants, in favor of protecting the more sympathetic party? Maybe they’re
    truly concerned that the courts no longer recognize the value of journalism and
    need a history lesson? No other AI-related complaint has worked so hard to justify
    the very existence, needs, and frustrations of its plaintiffs.

  zh: 这起投诉的另一个真正有趣之处在于它描述了《纽约时报》的业务程度 - 记者们为创建文章付出了多少努力，他们在报道过程中面临的身体风险，一般良好新闻报道的价值，以及《纽约时报》在适应网络世界方面的斗争。投诉书描绘了一个光荣的行业，一再被科技行业戏弄，后者在历史上只有在巨大的公众压力和《纽约时报》继续生存的艰苦努力下才屈服。有趣的是，美国版权法明确拒绝了所谓的“额头的汗水”应该受到版权保护的观念。换句话说，编写某些信息（比如电话簿）需要巨大的努力或资源，并不赋予该作品任何版权保护
    - 其他人可以自由使用。而且，在存在版权表达时，创建它的困难是无关紧要的。那么，这些背景是否仅仅旨在支持不正当竞争的主张？这是一种悄悄地要求法院忽视“额头的汗水”先例的方式，直至被辩护人最终主张，以保护更加令人同情的一方？也许他们真的担心法院不再认可新闻的价值，需要一堂历史课？其他任何与人工智能相关的投诉都没有如此努力地为其原告的存在、需求和挫折辩护过。
- en: Unless Microsoft and OpenAI hustle to strike a deal with the New York Times,
    this is definitely going to be the case to watch in the next year or two. Not
    only does it embody some of the strongest legal arguments related to copyright,
    it is likely to become a lightning rod for many interests who will use it to wage
    a proxy war on their behalf. The case, and especially the media coverage of the
    case, will likely embitter the public and politicians even further against big
    tech, treating its success as a zero sum game vis a vis journalists and creators
    more broadly. It’s the kind of case that ultimately results in federal legislation,
    either codifying a judgment or statutorily reversing it.

  zh: 除非微软和OpenAI赶紧与《纽约时报》达成协议，否则接下来一两年肯定会引人关注。这不仅体现了与版权相关的一些最有力的法律论点，而且可能成为许多利益相关者的焦点，他们将利用它代表自己发动一场代理战争。这个案子，特别是案件的媒体报道，很可能会进一步激怒公众和政治家们对科技巨头的不满，把其成功视为一场与广义上的新闻工作者和创作者零和游戏的情况。这是一种最终导致联邦立法的案件，要么对判决进行法定编码，要么在法定范围内予以反转。
