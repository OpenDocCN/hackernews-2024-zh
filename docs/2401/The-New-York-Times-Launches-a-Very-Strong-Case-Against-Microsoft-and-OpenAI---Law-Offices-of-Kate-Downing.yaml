- en: It seems that The New York Times Company (“The Times”) got fed up with the pace
    of its negotiations with Microsoft and OpenAI over their use of The Times’ content
    for training and running their LLMs. So much so that The Times filed a post-Christmas
    [complaint](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf)
    against the two, likely knowing full well they’d lay waste to the winter vacations
    of hundreds of people working for OpenAI and Microsoft. It might be the most well-known
    AI-related case to date because the case isn’t a class action and the plaintiff
    is globally recognized.

- en: Unlike other complaints, this one doesn’t spend too much time explaining how
    AI models work or teeing up the analogies they plan to use in court. Instead,
    the complaint includes multiple extremely clear-cut examples of the LLMs spitting
    out The Times’ content nearly verbatim or stating bald-faced lies about The Times’
    content. Many of the other complaints admitted they weren’t able to find clear-cut
    examples of infringing output, nebulously resting their claims on the idea that
    all output is, by definition, infringing. Here, Microsoft and OpenAI haven’t just
    used The Times’ content to teach the AI how to communicate, they’ve launched news-specific
    services and features that ingest both archived content and brand new articles
    from The Times. The other plaintiffs also weren’t able to argue that their specific
    content, out of the trillions of pieces of training data in the datasets, was
    particularly important for creating quality AIs. Here, The Times convincingly
    argues that its content was extremely valuable for training the AIs, both because
    of the quantity involved as well as the fact that the training process involved
    instructing the AI to prioritize The Times’ content.

    quite possible that a jury or judge angry at Microsoft and OpenAI for offering
    services that compete with and undercut The Times is more likely to also find
    that the training activities constituted copyright infringement and that the model
    itself is a derivative work of the training data, without thinking too hard about
    a scenario where the ultimate model doesn’t supplant the business or livelihood
    of the copyright holders in the training data. It’s definitely a case where “bad
    facts invite bad law.”

- en: This case is also notable for the fact that it explicitly goes after the defendants
    for their AIs’ hallucinations. An AI summarizing a news event based on one or
    more news articles opens a Pandora’s box worth of debate about the line between
    uncopyrightable facts and copyrightable expression, as well as how/if those same
    standards should be applied to a computer “reading” the news. But the hallucinations
    aren’t facts; they’re lies. And even if the defendants prevail in arguing that
    the AIs are mostly just providing people with unprotectable facts, there’s very
    little to shield them from liability for the lies, both with respect to trademark
    dilution claims, but also with respect to potential libel or privacy-related claims
    that might be brought by other individuals. Copyright law can forgive a certain
    amount of infringement under certain circumstances but these other areas of law
    are far less flexible.

- en: The other really interesting thing about this complaint is the extent to which
    it describes the business of The Times – how much work the journalists put in
    to create the articles, the physical risks they take during reporting, the value
    of good journalism in general, and The Times’ struggle with adjusting to an online
    world. The complaint paints a picture of an honorable industry repeatedly pants-ed
    by the tech industry, which historically has only come to heel under enormous
    public pressure and the Herculean efforts of The Times to continue to survive.
    It’s interesting because US copyright law decisively rejects the idea that copyright
    protection is due for what is commonly referred to as “sweat of the brow.” In
    other words, the fact that it takes great effort or resources to compile certain
    information (like a phonebook), doesn’t entitle that work to any copyright protection
    – others may use it freely. And where there is copyrightable expression, the difficulty
    in creating it is irrelevant. So, is all this background aimed solely at supporting
    the unfair competition claim? Is it a quiet way of asking the court to ignore
    the “sweat of the brow” precedent, to the extent that it’s ultimately argued by
    the defendants, in favor of protecting the more sympathetic party? Maybe they’re
    truly concerned that the courts no longer recognize the value of journalism and
    need a history lesson? No other AI-related complaint has worked so hard to justify
    the very existence, needs, and frustrations of its plaintiffs.

    this is definitely going to be the case to watch in the next year or two. Not
    only does it embody some of the strongest legal arguments related to copyright,
    it is likely to become a lightning rod for many interests who will use it to wage
    a proxy war on their behalf. The case, and especially the media coverage of the
    case, will likely embitter the public and politicians even further against big
    tech, treating its success as a zero sum game vis a vis journalists and creators
    more broadly. It’s the kind of case that ultimately results in federal legislation,
    either codifying a judgment or statutorily reversing it.
