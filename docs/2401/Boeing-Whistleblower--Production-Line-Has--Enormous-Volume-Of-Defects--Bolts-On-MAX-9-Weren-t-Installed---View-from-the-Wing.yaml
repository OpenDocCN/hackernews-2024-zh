    that suggests they have access to Boeing’s internal quality control systems, and
    shares details of what they saw regarding the Boeing 737 MAX 9 flown by Alaska
    Airlines that had a door plug detach inflight, causing rapid decompression of
    the aircraft.

    when they show up at the production line that Boeing’s quality control staff can’t
    keep up with them all.

    off of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been covered in a number
    of articles and videos across aviation channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent
    the mid-exit door plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take
    the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts were not installed
    when Boeing delivered the airplane, our own records reflect this.

    365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door
    installations (so both actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like
    the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very alarming number, and
    if our quality system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven
    the issue back to supplier after the first few instances.

    and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side door, not the LH that actually
    failed. I could blame the team for missing certain details, but given the enormous
    volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it was inevitable something
    would slip through- and on the incident aircraft something did. I know what you
    are thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there is a plot twist
    coming up.

    the factory quite quickly, 24 hours completely changes who is working on the plane)
    wrote up a finding for damaged and improperly installed rivets on the LH mid-exit
    door of the incident aircraft.

    has teams on site in Renton performing warranty work for all of their shoddy quality,
    and this SAT promptly gets shunted into their queue as a warranty item. Lots of
    bickering ensues in the SAT messages, and it takes a bit for Spirit to get to
    the work package. Once they have finished, they send it back to a Boeing QA for
    final acceptance, but then Malicious Stupid Happens! The Boeing QA writes another
    record in CMES (again, the correct venue) stating (with pictures) that Spirit
    has not actually reworked the discrepant rivets, they *just painted over the defects*.
    In Boeing production speak, this is a “process failure”. For an A&P mechanic at
    an airline, this would be called “federal crime”.

    of “coordinating with the doors team to determine if the door will have to be
    removed entirely, or just opened. If it is removed then a Removal will have to
    be written.” Note: a Removal is a type of record in CMES that requires formal
    sign off from QA that the airplane been restored to drawing requirements.'

    to spot the critical error: regardless of whether the door is simply opened or
    removed entirely, the 4 retaining bolts that keep it from sliding off of the door
    stops have to be pulled out. A removal should be written in either case for QA
    to verify install, but as it turns out, someone (exactly who will be a fun question
    for investigators) decides that the door only needs to be opened, and no formal
    Removal is generated in CMES (the reason for which is unclear, and a major process
    failure). Therefore, in the official build records of the airplane, a pressure
    seal that cannot be accessed without opening the door (and thereby removing retaining
    bolts) is documented as being replaced, but the door is never officially opened
    and thus no QA inspection is required.'

    unlabeled (because there is no formal record number to label them with) on a work-in-progress

    aircraft, though also that production issues are common. That doesn’t square with
    a theory that [bolts could have come loose from flying a poorly-designed aircraft](https://viewfromthewing.com/is-there-a-design-flaw-in-the-boeing-737-max-9/),
    or that Boeing 737-900ERs [are being inspected too](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68052160).
    Those have the same door plug because the MAX 9 is built on the same airframe.
    It may or may not square with finding loose door plugs on other Boeing 737 MAX
    9s.

    who suggests they’re a whistleblower inside of Boeing. A story in *Politico* this
    morning suggests that [Boeing’s new team of lobbyists has their work cut out for
    them](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/22/boeing-lobbying-congress-faa-00136704#:~:text=Boeing%20is%20still%20a%20sprawling,Patton%20Boggs%20and%20Crossroads%20Strategies.).
    It certainly appears so, but perhaps work needs to start at the board and C-suite
    level.
