    only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user
    tapping through to the web from [the new External Purchase Links entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/)

    users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission.
    That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should
    be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which
    doesn’t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this *also* offer
    in-app purchasing.

    with completely, given that he’s in the games business — because games are different,
    and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly
    standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they’re
    consoles for games and apps.

    injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn’t, not that they legally can’t.

    that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the
    App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally,
    [I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer”
    mode](https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper) — chock
    full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that
    would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on
    iOS as there are on the Mac. That’s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting
    aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,^([1](#fn1-2024-01-17))
    I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to do this. There
    are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software.
    I’m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the
    largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.

    PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “*it’s my device, I
    should decide and control what software runs on it*” argument. I get it. But I
    also get that most consumers’ Windows PCs, and many Macs,^([2](#fn2-2024-01-17))
    are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts
    of [anti-user shenanigans](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/)
    you’d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far
    from perfect — I mean come on, [that should go without saying](https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection) — but
    it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for *any* typical
    users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or
    iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall
    if you don’t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch,
    PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google’s Play Store review
    seems comparatively lax) for Android.

    are right! Let’s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions
    here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple *should not*
    be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting
    commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would
    lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are
    taking to the company’s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor
    the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech”
    hunt.

    pressure over the past few years, and in today’s climate that’s more true than
    ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “*Bring it on.*” Confrontational,
    not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with *most*
    of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep *everything*.
    To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent’s king. Apple seemingly
    wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament
    where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship
