    for search, it simply makes search worse.

    you want custom art, pay an artist.

    wait for a person that can actually help.

    (though it may appear to). If I'm weary of too much volume on any social platform
    or in any news feed, I'll cut back on what I'm following.

    If you're having AI write your email, it probably wasn't that important. If it's
    screening job candidates for you, you're missing quality candidates.

- en: These tools will improve. The cost to the environment will increase, it will
    help companies deskill jobs and muddy public discourse. The "benefits" it provides
    to end users are, at best, dubious — though everyone responsible for creating
    it will most certainly enrich themselves.
