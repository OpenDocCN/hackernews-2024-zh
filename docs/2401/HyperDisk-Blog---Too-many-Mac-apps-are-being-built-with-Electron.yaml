- en: This test gets into the concept of “feel,” as in the way an app feels when you
    run it. Efficiently written apps feel as if there’s nothing standing between you
    and the computer, no gunky layer to gum up the works and slow things down.

    test, there’s no contest between BBEdit’s 1 second launch time and WhatsApp’s
    16 seconds on a 2021 MacBook Pro.

- en: It’s a common mistake to conflate “memory” and “disk space,” but they're different
    things. Memory is RAM—it has to do with how much stuff you can run at once. Disk
    space has to do with how much stuff you can store on your computer.

- en: BBEdit, while open in a typical working scenario, is using 173 MB of memory.
    That’s no small potatoes, but it’s a pretty small chunk of the 8-32 GB that’s
    installed on most Macs today.

    that blows up my whole... oh wait. Never mind, WhatsApp is running 5 weird “helper
    processes” and using about 1.4 GB in total. That’s actually worse than I expected.

    consuming Photoshop-league memory, *just to display your text messages*. This
    is Electron Apps, and they must be stopped.

- en: And while we’re at it, let’s talk about those helper processes. Their names
    are WhatsApp Helper, WhatsApp Helper, WhatsApp Helper (GPU), WhatsApp Helper (Renderer)
    and WhatsApp Helper (Renderer). A Mac app shouldn't need *any* of these. They’re
    probably communicating with each other using sockets or ports, or maybe shared
    files. This really isn’t how you’re supposed to build a Mac app. This shouldn’t
    become normalized. As Scotty said in Star Trek III, “the more they overthink the
    plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain.”
