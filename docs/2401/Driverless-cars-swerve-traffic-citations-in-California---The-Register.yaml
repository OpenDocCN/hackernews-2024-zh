    laws while cruising around California. Police in San Francisco were told that
    "no citation for a moving violation can be issued if the [autonomous vehicle]
    is being operated in a driverless mode" in an internal memo, [first reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/can-driverless-cars-get-tickets-california-law-rcna131538)
    by NBC.

    while in motion if no driver is behind the wheel. In 2018 a test driver operating
    a Cruise car in self-driving mode was ticketed when the vehicle failed to yield
    to a pedestrian at a crosswalk. But traffic crimes committed by driverless vehicles
    can go unpunished since citations can only be issued to humans who were at the
    wheel.

    was the first in the US to approve commercial rides for Cruise's robo-taxi service
    back in June. But the permit was later revoked after one of its driverless cars
    struck and dragged a pedestrian along the street in an [accident](https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/04/driverless_cruise_car_pedestrian/)
    in October last year. The victim had been knocked down into the path of the Cruise
    vehicle by a hit-and-run human driver in another car.

    the expansion of autonomous vehicles. Officials raised [concerns](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/27/gm_cruise_robocar_safety_waiver/)

    operators liable for violating driving rules. Texas will fine the owners of autonomous
    vehicles if the technology breaks traffic laws regardless of whether a person
    is sitting behind the wheel or not. Arizona issues traffic citations to the operators
    of driverless cars too.

    by Amazon, is driving its L3 level vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Nevada,
