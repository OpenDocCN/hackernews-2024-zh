- en: Ever since I visited my first web site (via a slow modem to a library BBS running
    a text-based web browser), I have been ceaselessly pondering the nature of the
    web. I knew from my first experience visiting a site as a young child, that the
    web (and the internet in general) was going to profoundly re-architect our culture.
    A re-architecting that would be so radical, so complicated, and so fast paced,
    that we would likely evolve alongside those changes in a way that none of us would
    really predict or understand. And I knew that we would make some big mistakes
    along the way.. because we had no idea what the hell we were doing.

    where novel ideas for web startups were turned into trumped-up card bets. There
    were some great ideas and companies that came out of that period. But there were
    also companies that got too greedy, overvalued their companies to raise easy bubble
    money, and expanded beyond their ability to sustain themselves (a playbook that,
    hauntingly to me, seems quite at home with the current startup climate). Massive
    web corporations flush with stock market cash acquired startups for billions of
    dollars, like rich brats that wanted a cool new toy, but then quickly got tired
    of it and threw it away. And in the end, we lost a lot of great ideas, companies,
    **and user content** that would have otherwise prospered.

- en: A lot of people have mistakenly told me that GeoCities was shut down because
    it was a bad idea, or because it was “too old”, or because people didn’t want
    to make and visit web sites anymore. The problem is that it ignores the internal
    problems that would be the real cause of its demise. Yahoo! acquired GeoCities
    in 1999 for $3.57 billion in bubble stock, and at the time (and perhaps still
    today) had [a toxic approach to acquisitions](http://waxy.org/2013/04/the_death_of_upcomingorg)
    that would effectively ruin the startups they acquired. Everyone is holding their
    breath on the Tumblr acquisition to see if they learned their lessons from the
    previous failures. Hopefully they did.

    dancing baby GIFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_baby) and [Limp Bizkit
    MIDI files](http://www.midiworld.com/files/1067). **They deleted the ability for
    people (both old and new to the web) to easily create web sites, and be in complete
    control of the content and presentation they provide to their audience.**

    and interesting. We used to call it “surfing” the web, and that was actually a
    good way to describe it. There was a certain adventure to the activity - a fun
    and excitement in exploring the unknown.

    into the great unknowns of the web, we instead now spend most of our time on social
    networks: boring, suburban gated communities, where everybody’s “profile” looks
    exactly the same, and presents exactly the same content, in the same arrangement.
    Rarely do we create things on these networks; Instead, we consume, and report
    on our consumption. The uniformity and blandness rival something out of a [Soviet
    bloc residential apartments corridor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel%C3%A1k).
    And now adding to that analogy, we’ve found out that our government is actually
    spying on us while we’re doing it, [in ways the Stasi could only dream of](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/06/26/195045/memories-of-stasi-color-germans.html).

    curtain, and we need to change that.**'

    into a GeoCities parody site, though I don’t really care if people use it that
    way. The purpose of this project is not to inspire nostalgia. **It’s to rebuild
    the platform for us to be able to be creative again.** To have sites that we can
    do whatever we want with. This is not nostalgia speaking. We really did lose our
    platforms for creativity and rich self expression online, and I want to help bring
    them back.

    magical. It did not take away the joy of creation. It’s still fun to make web
    pages, you can still share it with every internet user in the world 24/7\. **And
    when you don’t have to attach your real identity to everything you do, it still
    doesn’t matter how old you are, what you look like, or what your social class
    is**. If you have a library card and a few hours, you can make a web site on NeoCities.

    making web pages that don’t look like crap, and don’t randomly break on different
    web browsers. Now we have HTML5, which enables very powerful web sites. Like [this
    amazing site](http://mlpfim.neocities.org), an interactive episode guide to the
    show My Little Pony, which looks fantastic and uses your browser database for
    storage (I *dare* you to make it half as good with your over-engineered, poorly
    scalable [LAMP stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle))). And
    we have great CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap)
    and a new, even simpler one that [Scott O’Hara](https://twitter.com/scottohara)
    is working on called [Ground Floor](http://groundfloor.neocities.org), that makes
    web sites look pretty good **even if the designer doesn’t use or understand CSS
    at all**.

    with that short time frame, [a](http://dragonquest.neocities.org) [lot](http://ninjabit.neocities.org)
    [of](http://scientology.neocities.org) [them](http://eksith.neocities.org) [are](http://dyingtime.neocities.org)
    [really](http://mlpfim.neocities.org) [good](http://simonsroom.neocities.org).
    And there are [more sites being generated every day](http://neocities.org/browse).
    And there are people using the site to [learn HTML](http://eleanor.neocities.org)
    (something [Victoria Wang](https://twitter.com/violasong) is working to improve,
    while also working on [building a really great design](https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web/commit/4eaa8f7ace84f9062302666fd7997a2154b77a7e)
    for the site with Scott). If that much creativity can happen with one week (and
    with the site editing code in early stages), how much more creativity will come
    out of the next year?

    millions of web sites without having to worry about making a profit. Even the
    current 10 Megabyte limit on accounts is just a conservative start. **We will
    be raising the limit to 20 Megabytes soon**, and probably will be raising it much
    higher later as we learn what our scaling needs are. Part of the reason we will
    be able to do this is that I’m building some better servers that can handle **2+
    million NeoCities accounts**. I’m paying for the servers out of pocket, which
    is tough for me because I currently don’t have a large income, but NeoCities needs
    and deserves it. **The web needs and deserves it.** If we are to break free from
    the consumption-oriented web we have today, we need more creative spaces like
    this.

    and through supporter accounts. I will not be taking any money with dangerous
    strings attached to it, and I will not be turning it into a VC-backed startup.
    We need to maintain this as a sustainable resource, the same way that sites like
    the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org) are. The [source code to NeoCities](https://github.com/kyledrake/neocities-web)
