- en: NEW ORLEANS — Astrobotic’s Peregrine spacecraft will not be able to attempt
    a landing on the moon because of a fuel leak shortly after its Jan. 8 launch.

- en: In an update late Jan. 8, about 12 hours after first reporting an anomaly with
    the spacecraft, the Pittsburgh-based company said the spacecraft would likely
    lose attitude control in 40 hours, depriving the spacecraft of power from its
    solar panels.

- en: “An ongoing propellant leak is causing the spacecraft’s Attitude Control System
    (ACS) thrusters to operate well beyond their expected service life cycles to keep
    the lander from an uncontrollable tumble,” the company stated. “If the thrusters
    can continue to operate, we believe the spacecraft could continue in a stable
    sun pointing state for approximately 40 more hours, based on current fuel consumption.”

    under the mission’s original timeline. “At this time, the goal is to get Peregrine
    as close to lunar distance as we can before it loses the ability to maintain its
    sun-pointing position and subsequently loses power.”

- en: “Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing
    on the Moon. However, we do still have enough propellant to continue to operate
    the vehicle as a spacecraft,” the company said in an update shortly after 12 p.m.
    Eastern. Jan. 9\. The company said it was finding ways to extend the spacecraft’s
    life as it tests lander systems and its payloads.

    [United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan Centaur rocket successfully placed it into a
    lunar transfer orbit](https://spacenews.com/vulcan-centaur-launches-peregrine-lunar-lander-on-inaugural-mission/).
    That anomaly kept the spacecraft from going into a “stable sun-pointing orientation”
    needed for its solar arrays to charge its batteries. Controllers directed the
    spacecraft to perform an “improvised maneuver” that successfully established the
    proper orientation.

- en: In a series of updates over the course of the day, the company said the anomaly
    was with the spacecraft’s propulsion system, later identifying it as a leak. “Unfortunately,
    it appears the failure within the propulsion system is causing a critical loss
    of propellant,” Astrobotic stated. “The team is working to try and stabilize this
    loss, but given the situation, we have prioritized maximizing the science and
    data we can capture.”

- en: The company released an image of part of the spacecraft taken by a camera on
    board. That image showed what the company described as a “disturbance” in the
    lander’s multi-layer insultation (MLI). “The disturbance of the MLI is the first
    visual clue that aligns with our telemetry data pointing to a propulsion system
    anomaly,” the company stated.

- en: Astrobotic has not provided additional details about the leak in the propulsion
    system, such as where the leak is located. Development of the propulsion system
    had been a challenge for Astrobotic. At a November briefing, Chris Culbert, program
    manager for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which awarded
    Astrobotic $108 million to fly payloads on this mission, said it took off some
    of the original payloads because of issues with the performance of the descent
    engines used for landing.

- en: “For the most part, there were not available commercial engines with the right
    mix of performance and cost that would be matched to the size of the lander being
    developed,” he said. “That meant that a lot of the CLPS vendors, not just Astrobotic,
    are planning to use engine designs that are new. Not surprisingly, new technology
    has some risk associated with it, and it doesn’t always work as advertised in
    the first iteration.”

- en: “Rather than delay this mission further to wait on additional engine development,
    we worked with Astrobotic to agree on getting the most important payloads delivered
    as early as possible,” he continued. “We did jointly agree to demanifest a handful
    of payloads from the first mission to enable that first mission to be more likely
    to succeed.”

    philosophy NASA adopted at the beginning of the CLPS program in 2018, acknowledging
    that some missions would fail but that those failures would be outweighed by the
    lower cost and greater innovation that commercial providers offered.

    for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said the agency was still
    committed to that approach. “We knew going into this that it’s a really difficult
    thing to do when we decided to go down this path, and it might turn out that they’re
    not all going to be successful, particularly some of the very earliest ones,”
    he said. “The companies, we believe, are in it for the long haul.”

    there is a higher risk,” he said in a Jan. 8 statement after Astrobotic reported
    the propulsion anomaly. “NASA is committed to supporting our commercial vendors
    as they navigate the very difficult task of sending science and technology to
    the surface of the moon.”

    mission as well before liftoff. “At the end of the day, we need to get as much
    data as we can at every point through the mission so that we can learn and get
    better as an industry and as a company individually,” he said in a prelaunch interview.
    “I’m hoping that we get as much data as we can through the course of that to make
    the next mission better.”

- en: “I think inevitably the first missions are going to have some rockiness, probably,”
    he said, but believed NASA was committed to continuing CLPS even if there are
    failures. “The train is rolling. It’s hard to stop, and that’s a good thing.”
