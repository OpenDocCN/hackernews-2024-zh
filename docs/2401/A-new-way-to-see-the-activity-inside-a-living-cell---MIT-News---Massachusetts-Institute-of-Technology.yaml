    influence their behavior. Being able to measure those signals and how cells respond
    to them through downstream molecular signaling networks could help scientists
    learn much more about how cells work, including what happens as they age or become
    diseased.

    techniques for imaging cells are limited to just a handful of different molecule
    types within a cell at one time. However, MIT researchers have developed an alternative
    method that allows them to observe up to seven different molecules at a time,
    and potentially even more than that.

    cascade of events, which then causes a specific cellular function,” says Edward
    Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology. “How does that occur? It’s
    arguably one of the fundamental problems of biology, and so we wondered, could
    you simply watch it happen?”

    on and off at different rates. By imaging a cell over several seconds, minutes,
    or hours, and then extracting each of the fluorescent signals using a computational
    algorithm, the amount of each target protein can be tracked as it changes over
    time.

    to learn a great deal about the functions of many cellular molecules. This type
    of study is often done with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was first deployed
    for imaging in the 1990s. Since then, several fluorescent proteins that glow in
    other colors have been developed for experimental use.

    colors, allowing researchers only a tiny glimpse of the overall activity that
    is happening inside a cell. If they could track a greater number of labeled molecules,
    researchers could measure a brain cell’s response to different neurotransmitters
    during learning, for example, or investigate the signals that prompt a cancer
    cell to metastasize.

    in real time, and then you could understand how they relate to each other. That
    would tell you how the cell computes,” Boyden says. “The problem is that you can’t
    watch very many things at the same time.”

- en: In 2020, Boyden’s lab developed a way to simultaneously image up to five different
    molecules within a cell, by targeting glowing reporters to distinct locations
    inside the cell. This approach, known as “[spatial multiplexing](https://news.mit.edu/2020/cell-imaging-signals-1123),”
    allows researchers to distinguish signals for different molecules even though
    they may all be fluorescing the same color.

- en: 'In the new study, the researchers took a different approach: Instead of distinguishing
    signals based on their physical location, they created fluorescent signals that
    vary over time. The technique relies on “switchable fluorophores” — fluorescent
    proteins that turn on and off at a specific rate. For this study, Boyden and his
    group members identified four green switchable fluorophores, and then engineered
    two more, all of which turn on and off at different rates. They also identified
    two red fluorescent proteins that switch at different rates, and engineered one
    additional red fluorophore.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of these switchable fluorophores can be used to label a different type
    of molecule within a living cell, such an enzyme, signaling protein, or part of
    the cell cytoskeleton. After imaging the cell for several minutes, hours, or even
    days, the researchers use a computational algorithm to pick out the specific signal
    from each fluorophore, analogous to how the human ear can pick out different frequencies
    of sound.

    and low-pitched instruments, like a tuba. And in the middle are instruments like
    the trumpet. They all have different sounds, and our ear sorts them out,” Boyden
    says.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mathematical technique that the researchers used to analyze the fluorophore
    signals is known as linear unmixing. This method can extract different fluorophore
    signals, similar to how the human ear uses a mathematical model known as a Fourier
    transform to extract different pitches from a piece of music.

    of the fluorescently labeled molecules were found in the cell during the entire
    imaging period. The imaging itself can be done with a simple light microscope,
    with no specialized equipment required.

    molecules involved in the cell division cycle, in mammalian cells. This allowed
    them to identify patterns in how the levels of enzymes called cyclin-dependent
    kinases change as a cell progresses through the cell cycle.

    are involved in nearly every aspect of cell signaling, as well as cell structures
    and organelles such as the cytoskeleton and mitochondria. In addition to their
    experiments using mammalian cells grown in a lab dish, the researchers showed
    that this technique could work in the brains of zebrafish larvae.

- en: This method could be useful for observing how cells respond to any kind of input,
    such as nutrients, immune system factors, hormones, or neurotransmitters, according
    to the researchers. It could also be used to study how cells respond to changes
    in gene expression or genetic mutations. All of these factors play important roles
    in biological phenomena such as growth, aging, cancer, neurodegeneration, and
    memory formation.

    on expanding the repertoire of switchable fluorophores so that they can study
