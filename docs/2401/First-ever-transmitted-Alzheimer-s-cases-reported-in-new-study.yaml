    of the condition. But it was also that the patients were in their 40s and 50s,
    even their 30s, far younger than people who normally develop the disease. They
    didn’t even have the known genetic mutations that can set people on the course
    for such early-onset Alzheimer’s.'

    they had received growth hormone taken from the brains of human cadavers, which
    used to be a treatment for a number of conditions that caused short stature. Now,
    decades later, they were showing signs of Alzheimer’s. In the interim, scientists
    had discovered that that type of hormone treatment they got could unwittingly
    transfer bits of protein into recipients’ brains. In some cases, it had induced
    a fatal brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD — a finding that
    led to the banning of the procedure 40 years ago.

    As the scientific team treating the patients [reported Monday](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02729-2)
    in the journal Nature Medicine, the hormone transplant seeded the beta-amyloid
    protein that’s a hallmark of Alzheimer’s in some recipients’ brains, which, decades
    later, propagated into disease-causing plaques. They are the first known cases
    of transmitted Alzheimer’s disease, likely a scientific anomaly yet a finding
    that adds another wrinkle [to ongoing arguments about what truly causes Alzheimer’s](https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/25/alzheimers-cabal-thwarted-progress-toward-cure/).

    particular because only people who had received cadaveric growth hormone prepared
    in a particular way — a method that doesn’t eliminate protein bits — went on to
    develop dementia.

    medical procedure. In conditions like iatrogenic CJD, the transmissible agents
    are known as prions — basically, misfolded pieces of protein that go on to cause
    disease, like a sort of infectious bug.

    But regardless, the paper’s authors “provide tantalizing evidence that, under
    extraordinary circumstances, Alzheimer’s disease is transmissible by a prion-like
    mechanism,” Mathias Jucker of Germany’s University of Tübingen and Lary Walker
    of Emory University [wrote in a commentary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02768-9)

    some contagious disease that you could catch by caring for a relative, for example.
    Cases tied to cadaveric growth hormone treatment are also no longer possible;
    a synthetic hormone has been used instead for decades. The paper’s authors, who
    run a special prion disease research and treatment center in London, describe
    just five Alzheimer’s patients out of the more than 1,800 people who were known
    to have received cadaveric growth hormone in the U.K. from 1959 to 1985\. Still,
    the researchers said the findings were a reminder of the continuing importance
    of practices like sterilizing neurosurgical instruments, which, in theory, could
    transfer prions if not properly cleaned between patients.

    fallout of the use of cadaveric growth hormone — these cases could also stir up
    the decades-long, oft-contentious fight over the roots of Alzheimer’s.

    relatively small number of patients,” said John Collinge of the MRC Prion Unit
    at University College London, the senior author of the paper. “However, the implications
    of this paper we think are broader with respect to disease mechanisms — that it
    looks like what’s going on in Alzheimer’s disease is very similar in many respects
    to what happens in the human prion diseases like CJD, with the propagation of
    these abnormal aggregates of misfolded proteins and misshapen proteins.”

    Alzheimer’s, and therapies that can clear the protein from people’s brains have
    finally, after decades of failed attempts, [started showing](https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/06/leqembi-alzheimers-fda-approval-eisai-biogen/)
    some [benefits for patients](https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/17/alzheimers-disease-donanemab-eli-lilly-detailed-data/).
    But most experts also think amyloid isn’t solely responsible. So in these cases,
    was there something else going on in addition to the amyloid transfer?

    of the findings. They said there was limited information, with findings reported

    brains, another hallmark of Alzheimer’s that can be induced by amyloid. They also
    wondered why there was so little presence of another protein called tau in the
    people’s brains despite their cognitive losses, even though tau levels often correlate
    to cognitive decline. Some researchers speculated that the patients may have had
    some other genetic mutation that could increase their risk of Alzheimer’s. Two
    of the patients had intellectual disabilities, another risk factor.

    Wolozin said. “The question is, what’s driving disease? There are many weird things
    about these rare cases. What’s unclear from the images is, why would they develop
    such severe dementia that quickly?”

    have been documented in recipients of cadaveric human growth hormone, with the
    bulk of patients in France, the U.K., and the U.S. And for years, researchers
    have been gathering clues that there may be an iatrogenic form of Alzheimer’s
    as well. (The vast majority of Alzheimer’s cases are what’s known as sporadic,
    developing among older people. There are also some early-onset cases that are
    tied to inherited mutations.)

    finding lots of beta-amyloid in the brains of patients who died of iatrogenic
    CJD, including a buildup in the brain’s blood vessels, which is known as cerebral
    amyloid angiopathy and which is seen in most people with Alzheimer’s. It led them
    to hypothesize that the hormones the patient received had been contaminated not
    just with the CJD prions, but seeds of amyloid as well. It also made them wonder
    whether the patients, had CJD not killed them, would have gone on to develop Alzheimer’s.

    Prion Clinic from 2017 to 2022, none of whom had CJD and only some of whom were

    for different causes of short stature: some had brain tumors, others had developmental
    conditions, others just lacked their own natural hormone.'

    other possible causes of these patients’ Alzheimer’s. Given the age of the patients,
    these weren’t sporadic cases, which almost always develop only later in life.
    The patients didn’t have known genetic mutations that could cause early-onset
    dementia. The researchers also considered the underlying reasons why the patients
    had received the hormone in the first place — was it a result of their cancer
    treatment or congenital conditions? — but that wasn’t a likely explanation either.

    this particular preparation in childhood. … There was no other unifying cause
