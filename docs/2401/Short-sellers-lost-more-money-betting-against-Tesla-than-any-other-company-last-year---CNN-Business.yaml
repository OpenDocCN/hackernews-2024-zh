    who placed bets that the value of Tesla shares were going to go down, lost a combined
    $12.2 billion last year, more than short sellers lost on any other company in
    2023.

  zh: 这里有一件肯定会让埃隆·马斯克微笑的事情 - 空头，那些打赌特斯拉股价会下跌的投资者，去年共损失了**122亿美元**，超过了他们在2023年对任何其他公司的损失。
- en: That estimate, from markets analytics firm S3 Partners, isn’t a shock – Tesla
    shares slightly more than doubled during the course of the year. But for the shorts
    to take that kind of hit, there needs to be not only gains for the shares, but
    also a large group betting the other way.

  zh: 来自市场分析公司S3 Partners的估计并不令人意外 - 特斯拉股价在整个年度内略微翻了一番。但要让空头（shorts）承受这种程度的打击，不仅股价需要上涨，而且还需要有大量的人打赌股价会下跌。
- en: With US stock indexes ending the year near record highs – the S&P 500 rose 22%
    for the year - shorts had a bad year overall. S3 estimates overall short losses
    reached $194.8 billion. But the losses by those shorting Tesla were particularly
    bad – more than the losses they suffered at Microsoft and Faceboook owner Meta,
    combined.

    - 超过了他们在微软和Facebook所有者Meta身上的损失总和。
- en: And Tesla, which is worth far more than any other automaker in the world – despite
    having sales that are a fraction ofmany established automakers – has long been
    a top target for shorts who believe the shares are overvauled. Last year, investors
    had an average short interest of $18.9 billion on Tesla shares, surpassed only
    by Apple, which has an average of $19 billion in short interest with a much larger
    market value than Tesla.

  zh: 特斯拉的价值远远超过世界上任何其他汽车制造商 - 尽管其销售额仅为许多传统汽车制造商的一小部分 - 长期以来一直是空头的首要目标，他们认为该公司的股价被高估。去年，特斯拉股票的平均空头利益达到了**189亿美元**，仅次于苹果，后者的平均空头利益为**190亿美元**，但市值远远高于特斯拉。

    United Auto Workers union against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis cost the

- en: The losses by short sellers are a stark contrast to a year ago, when shorts
    made a $15.9 billion profit on Tesla shares as the company’s stock lost 65% of
    the value. But Tesla shares have been going up far more often then down since
    it went public in 2010\. Since its shares started trading publicly, shorts have
    suffered a net loss of $61.8 billion, according to S3.

    did for the year as a whole, closing out $13 billion in losing short positions
    from January-June, but then making a $771 million profit in the final six months

- en: Even with that more recent decline, Tesla has a market capitalization of $756
    billion, more than twice the value of the second most valuable automaker, Toyota.
    That’s despite the fact that Toyota’s global sales are more than six times greater
    than Tesla’s. Dusaniwsky and some analysts bullish on Tesla shares say that short
    sellers are waiting for Tesla to start trading far below its current valuation.

- en: “Every year the bears come out of hibernation mode and think ‘This is the year
    that Tesla shares collapse,” said Dan Ives, analyst with Wedbush Securities. “The
    bears view it as an automobile company that should trade at a valuation a multiple
    of GM or Toyota. The bulls such as myself believe it’s a disruptive technology
    company. And that’s the Wall Street consensus view.”
