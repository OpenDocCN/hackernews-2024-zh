    accept hacking around bugs and restart it whenever something breaks. It *will*
    break with a number of apps that rely on EWMH or ICCCM compliance beyond what
    I’m currently supporting. The huge still contains horrible abominations against
    good taste I’ve not yet had the time to clean up.
