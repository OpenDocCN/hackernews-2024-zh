    circuit boards to make the process much cheaper, faster and easier. We do this
    for companies making a wide variety of devices including the medical, industrial,
    and consumer tech fields.'

- en: CircuitHub is primarily built using a combination of Haskell, Elm, Nix, and
    PostgreSQL, deployed to both AWS and bare metal machines. We use a significant
    amount of open-source technology, and also try and give back where possible (for
    example, both [Rel8](https://github.com/circuithub/rel8) and [Fast Downward Haskell
    bindings](https://github.com/circuithub/fast-downward)).

- en: CircuitHub spans a vast problem space. Challenges include computer vision (OpenCV),
    machine learning (PyTorch), hard optimization problems (Z3/MiniZinc), and all
    the normal engineering challenges of building both web-based customer-facing and
    internal tooling.

    robotics. [An old video from Haskell Exchange 2019](https://youtu.be/gl2Ze1WmrYY?si=zlFrqALU7DaPfS65&t=282)
    hints at what we are up to on the robotics side. We have progressed significantly
    since then!

    years. CircuitHub is profitable, with tens of millions in revenue. Small team
    (CircuitHub is ~45 employees) with tremendous growth opportunity and low risk.

- en: Our R&D team is ten people, with four engineers working directly on the Haskell
    code base. We are looking to expand the team significantly this year. We have
    many exciting problems to solve, from robotic path planning to more conventional
    web products.

    your other skills and experience would need to compensate. A possible profile,
    for instance, would be a professional robotics background with some hobbyist FP
    experience.

    will look for interests that correlate with what we are trying to accomplish.
    Life is too short to work on something you are not passionate about!
