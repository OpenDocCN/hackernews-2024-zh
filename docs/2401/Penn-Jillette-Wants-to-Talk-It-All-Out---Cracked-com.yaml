    him. Most people wouldn’t know what that is, but as a [Bob Dylan](https://www.cracked.com/article_38110_inside-bob-dylan-and-norm-macdonalds-mysterious-friendship.html)
    fan, I do — it’s his largely forgotten, widely panned 1978 film that he wrote,
    directed and starred in. Only real Dylan obsessives talk about it, and Jillette
    is one of them. I’m speaking to him over Zoom — I’m in Los Angeles, he’s in Las
    Vegas — and when I mention the poster, it makes him smile.

    done an interview that *didn’t* mention Dylan — but this is the first time I’ve
    been *asked* to talk about Dylan.’” The singer-songwriter is one of his heroes,
    and Jillette is tickled that I’ve brought Dylan up rather than him having to for
    once. “I bring in Dylan to explain everything,” he says.'

    offered modestly, complete with disclaimers or self-deprecating jokes. He thinks
    a lot about a lot of things, but he’s not sure he’s right about any of them. That’s
    where talking comes in for Jillette — it allows him to try a rough draft of a
    stance that maybe he’ll later refine. In other words, he’s someone who can change
    his mind — like when he recently renounced Libertarianism after long being one
    of its most public champions.

  zh: 当有一个剧院以你的名字命名的时候，你不能声称没有野心。但我实际上遇到过有野心的人。当我在百老汇时，我认识了[麦当娜](https://www.cracked.com/article_28606_madonnas-biopic-will-take-insane-richard-pryor-approach.html)——她会不断提高难度（使事情）更加艰难。我记得读过[埃尔维斯](https://www.cracked.com/article_37231_three-elvis-impersonators-on-austin-butlers-elvis.html)因为一些中国人不知道他的名字而心碎。其中最惊人的是[保罗·麦卡特尼](https://www.cracked.com/article_35577_the-untold-stories-of-when-paul-mccartney-hosted-snl-and-deadlifted-chris-farley.html)，他一再说，披头士并没有真正像他们应该的那样出名。
- en: My ambitions were always, I think, fairly level-headed. I felt I could earn
    my living like my dad, who went from jail guard in a small town to supporting
    his family doing something he really loved — that was my goal. And when people
    talk to me and Teller about success, the day we were paying our bills doing a
    magic and juggling show, I was done.

  zh: 我的志向一直，我想，相当平和。我觉得我可以像我爸爸一样谋生，他从一个小镇的监狱看守变成了一个真正喜欢的工作支持家庭的人——这是我的目标。当人们和我还有泰勒谈论成功时，我们支付账单的那一天，我就已经满足了。
- en: It was always so awkward when we were on Broadway and people would say, “(Did)
    you always dream of being on Broadway?” The answer, “No,” comes off as so ungrateful
    and so unpleasant and makes your skin crawl — but it’s the truth. I never wanted
    to be in a Broadway show. I certainly never wanted a Penn & Teller Theater in
    Vegas. But I wanted to do this show. So whereas the Beatles were not as famous
    as they should have been, Penn & Teller are much more famous than they should
    be. *(Laughs) *And much more influential on magic than we should be.

  zh: 当我们在百老汇时，人们总是问，“你一直梦想在百老汇上演吗？”答案“不”，听起来是如此的不感激和不愉快，让你的皮肤发麻 —— 但这是事实。我从未想过要在百老汇演出。我当然从未想过在拉斯维加斯有一个彭恩和泰勒剧院。但我想做这个节目。所以虽然披头士并没有像他们应该有的那么有名，但彭恩和泰勒比他们应该有的名气要多得多。*(笑)*
    并且对魔术的影响也比我们应该有的多得多。

  zh: '**我想我们真正谈论的是遗产。**'
- en: I get completely creeped out when people talk about legacy or the future. It
    seems like it is misunderstanding the job. Larry Fine of the Three Stooges was
    appalled that they would show the Three Stooges shorts, one after the other, on
    TV because, in Larry’s mind, they were live shows — it was not meant to just sit
    there.

  zh: 当人们谈论遗产或未来时，我感到非常不舒服。这似乎误解了这份工作。三个臭皮匠中的拉里·费恩对他们在电视上连播三个臭皮匠的短片感到震惊，因为在拉里看来，它们是现场表演
    —— 它们不是用来放在那里的。
- en: What I am doing is creating ephemera, and I believe that’s not only okay, that’s
    part of what makes it beautiful. I mean, I am aware it’s likely that in 30 years
    someone who is deeply interested in magic will dig up recordings of *Fool Us*
    and have things to learn, but that’s not what we’re really talking about. That’s
    excavating a piece of pottery.

  zh: 我正在创造临时性的东西，我相信这不仅是可以的，而且这是使其变得美丽的一部分。我的意思是，我意识到可能在30年后，一个对魔术非常感兴趣的人会挖出*愚弄我们*的录音，并有东西可以学习，但那不是我们真正谈论的。那只是挖掘出的一块陶器。
- en: Bob Dylan said he was a song-and-dance man, and I believe Bob Dylan really means
    that. The people that I know that know Dylan well say that when he says, “Don’t
    look back,” he means it. They say he’s the least sentimental person they’ve ever
    met — he finishes the lyrics to a song, he sings it, he throws it away. Now, other
    people pick it up and make hundreds of thousands of dollars — and it turns out
    he threw a lot of stuff in the box if he knew someone else would care about it,
    and that’s in the museum.

  zh: 鲍勃·迪伦说他是一个歌舞人，我相信鲍勃·迪伦确实是这样认为的。我认识的那些了解迪伦的人说，当他说“不要回头看”的时候，他是认真的。他们说他是他们见过的最不多愁善感的人
    —— 他写完一首歌的歌词，唱完，然后就把它扔了。现在，其他人捡起来并赚了几十万美元 —— 结果他扔掉了很多东西，如果他知道别人会在意的话，那些东西现在就在博物馆里。
- en: But one of the things that’s so inspirational about Dylan is he goes out and
    does live shows — he bangs them out. Some of Dylan’s best songs are recorded so
    sloppily — he sees the song as something that keeps going. Thursday night is my
    next live show — I’ll do the show, and that thing that I’ll do is a different
    thing for that night. That’s our job.

  zh: 但迪伦最令人鼓舞的一点是，他去现场表演 —— 他大力宣传。迪伦一些最好的歌曲录得非常粗糙 —— 他把歌看作是一直在进行的事情。星期四晚上是我的下一场现场表演
    —— 我会做这场表演，而我会做的那件事对于那个晚上来说是不同的事情。这就是我们的工作。
