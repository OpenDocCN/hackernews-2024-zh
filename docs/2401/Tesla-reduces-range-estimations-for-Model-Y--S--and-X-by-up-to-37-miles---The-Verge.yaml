- en: Tesla has lowered the range estimates across several Model Y, S, and X vehicles
    in the US, reducing the figure on certain trims by up to six percent. As reported
    by [*Electrek*](https://electrek.co/2024/01/05/tesla-model-y-range-estimate-reduced-by-6-becoming-more-realistic/),
    Tesla’s online configurator now displays an estimated range of 285 miles for the
    Model Y’s Performance trim, down 18 miles from its previous 303-mile estimate.

    has dropped from 333 miles to 326\. Estimates for the Model S Plaid have also
    been updated — more specifically, the configuration with 19-inch wheels which
    has fallen from 396 miles to 359\. These changes have not been made to Tesla’s
    UK and EU listings, and ranges across other vehicles like the Cybertruck, Model
    3, and the Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive remain unaffected.

    that the changes are related to two things after reviewing internal company documents.
    First, are “comfort and functionality improvements” made by Tesla that require
    more energy, and second is the implementation of revised EPA testing requirements
    that result in a “higher consumption and a slight decrease in overall range.”
