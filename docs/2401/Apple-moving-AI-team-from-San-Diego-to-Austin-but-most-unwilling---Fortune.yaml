    for improving Siri by listening to queries to the voice service and determining
    if it heard and handled questions accurately. The announcement to close the San
    Diego group was made by Christine DeFilippo, a top deputy to Apple AI chief John
    Giannandrea, the people said.

    DeFilippo）发出的，她是苹果人工智能主管约翰·吉安安德烈亚（John Giannandrea）的高级副手。
- en: An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the relocation decision, saying the company is
    bringing its “Data Operations Annotations teams in the US together at our campus
    in Austin, where a majority of the team is already based.” She added that “everyone

- en: The company also said it’s “deeply committed to San Diego,” where it has “grown
    significantly,” and that it is continuing to hire as Apple expands its engineering

- en: For the San Diego staff, the move came as a surprise. The AI team had been working
    from an office that Apple is renting, according to the people. But the company
    had told staff recently that they would be relocated to a new Apple campus in
    the area at the end of January. Earlier this month, Apple distributed packing
    boxes to employees to prepare for a relocation within the city.

- en: Instead, they’ll now have to move to Texas. People familiar with the matter
    told Bloomberg that the majority of affected workers have indicated that they’re
    unwilling to relocate to Austin. Apple told employees that they could apply for
    other jobs, but some don’t think they’ll be eligible for many roles because they
    don’t have engineering backgrounds, the people said.

    Apple, which had 161,000 employees as of September, has mostly managed to avoid
    layoffs since the pandemic — in contrast with most of its tech peers. It did,
    however, cut [some corporate retail jobs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-03/apple-to-make-small-number-of-job-cuts-in-some-corporate-retail-teams) last

    made up of contractors who listened to Siri queries to ensure their accuracy.
