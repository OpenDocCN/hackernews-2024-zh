- en: The group, known as Data Operations Annotations, was told Wednesday that they
    would be relocating to Austin to merge with the Texas portion of the same team,
    said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been
    announced.

    for improving Siri by listening to queries to the voice service and determining
    if it heard and handled questions accurately. The announcement to close the San
    Diego group was made by Christine DeFilippo, a top deputy to Apple AI chief John
    Giannandrea, the people said.

    bringing its “Data Operations Annotations teams in the US together at our campus
    in Austin, where a majority of the team is already based.” She added that “everyone
    currently employed will have the opportunity to continue their role with Apple

    significantly,” and that it is continuing to hire as Apple expands its engineering
    teams. In other countries where the affected team operates, Apple keeps all the
    employees in one office.

    from an office that Apple is renting, according to the people. But the company
    had told staff recently that they would be relocated to a new Apple campus in
    the area at the end of January. Earlier this month, Apple distributed packing
    boxes to employees to prepare for a relocation within the city.

    told Bloomberg that the majority of affected workers have indicated that they’re
    unwilling to relocate to Austin. Apple told employees that they could apply for
    other jobs, but some don’t think they’ll be eligible for many roles because they
    don’t have engineering backgrounds, the people said.

    Apple, which had 161,000 employees as of September, has mostly managed to avoid
    layoffs since the pandemic — in contrast with most of its tech peers. It did,
    however, cut [some corporate retail jobs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-03/apple-to-make-small-number-of-job-cuts-in-some-corporate-retail-teams) last
    April, as well as [recruiters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-16/apple-lays-off-recruiters-as-part-of-its-slowdown-in-hiring).

    keep their roles, Apple said. The company is offering $7,000 relocation stipends.
    Those who choose to leave Apple will see their roles eliminated and get four weeks
    of severance — plus an additional week for every year worked. They’ll also get
    six months of health insurance.

    made up of contractors who listened to Siri queries to ensure their accuracy.
    That practice [raised privacy concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/apple-suspends-listening-to-siri-commands-after-privacy-outcry) and
    was made optional for customers in 2019\. The contractors ended up being fired
    and replaced with full-time employees.

    to AI products based on large language models, or LLMs. These employees are now
    reviewing potential queries to Siri and choosing among a handful of answers. They
    then have to explain their decision. Apple is planning to announce its LLM plans
    in June, Bloomberg News has [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p?sref=9hGJlFio).
