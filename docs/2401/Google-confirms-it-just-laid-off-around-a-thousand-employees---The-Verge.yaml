    team](/2024/1/10/24033994/google-reorganization-fitbit-park-friedman-ar-layoffs)
    responsible for Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit products — it’s taken similarly sized
    bites out of Google’s core engineering and Google Assistant teams too. Google
    just confirmed to *The Verge* that it’s eliminated “a few hundred” roles in *each*
    of these divisions, meaning Google has confirmed layoffs of around a thousand
    employees on Wednesday alone, if we use a reasonable definition of “few.”

    Mencini to say if this was the complete and total number of job cuts in this round
    of layoffs, but she stopped replying at that point, only confirming existing layoff
    reports at [*9to5Google*](https://9to5google.com/2024/01/10/google-reorganizing-hardware/)
    and [*Semafor*](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/10/2024/google-lays-off-hundreds-working-on-its-voice-activated-assistant).
    [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/technology/google-layoffs.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share)
    reported on the engineering team layoffs too.

    she did not mention the other layoffs — but did write that “a number of our teams
    made changes to become more efficient and work better” and that “some teams are
    continuing to make these kinds of organizational changes, which include some role
    eliminations globally.”

    out the bad news instead of having it hit all at once.

    2023, so roughly a thousand job cuts would only be around half a percent of the
    company’s total. [There’s a lot of tech layoffs going around](/2022/11/14/23458204/meta-twitter-amazon-apple-layoffs-hiring-freezes-latest-tech-industry).
