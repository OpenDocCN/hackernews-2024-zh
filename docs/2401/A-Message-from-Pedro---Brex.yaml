    strategy and mission remain the same, we’re making some important changes today
    that will increase the intensity and quality of our execution.

    be leaving Brex today. Henrique and I are responsible for the decisions that led
    us here, and seeing so many talented folks go through this experience is never
    what you hope for as a founder. It’s incredibly hard to say goodbye, and we feel
    so grateful for their contributions building Brex into what it is now. We’re doing
    what we can do to ease the transition, and departing employees will receive:'

    Brex in 2017, we’ve had one goal: deeply integrating fintech and software into
    a single platform that empowers teams to make better financial decisions. We started
    as a corporate card, and in six years, became the leader in the spend management
    space. Today we’re proud to serve 1 in every 3 startups in the US, tens of thousands
    of businesses from public launch to global public companies, and in 2023 alone,
    hundreds of thousands of new customers’ employees that are now using Brex to make
    better financial decisions.'

    **building a high-velocity product and growth machine**. Looking inward, I realized
    we grew our org too quickly, making it harder to move at the speed we once did.
    This year, we decided to take a hard look at our current structure, and reduce
    the number of layers between leaders and the actual work that affects customers.
    This resulted in today’s hard decision. In addition, we’re also making the following
    changes to how we run the company:'

    Our goal is for leaders to operate closer to the metal, less siloed and more functionally,

    team and cascade across the org:'

    Camilla Morais is being promoted to COO and will report directly to me, together

    without him. I can’t wait to continue working with Michael on our board.'

    go to ensure high-velocity growth and profitability for years to come. Combined,
    these changes enable us to get there and become cash flow positive with the money

    of millions of dollars in revenue in a short span of time, Brex still serves less
    than 1% of the US market, and over the next few years, the opportunity ahead of
    us remains massive. Every single business needs to manage spend, and that’s much
    bigger than just helping them reduce costs. The goal of any finance team is to
    empower employees to make the best financial decisions that move their business
    forward. That’s precisely Brex’s mission and our right to win.

    increase the intensity and quality of our execution, connecting us more deeply
    to customers needs, and putting us on a clear path towards profitability and independence.
    I feel so confident in this team’s ability to rise to the occasion and continue
    building a generational company.
