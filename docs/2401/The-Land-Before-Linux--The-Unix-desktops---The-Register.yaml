    most of them never made it.

    Yes, that's right, before I was a Linux desktop user, I was a Unix user. Indeed,
    I've been a Unix fan since 1979, when [2BSD Unix](https://opensource.fandom.com/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
    arrived on the scene. But by 1993, numerous Unix desktops had appeared, and I
    talked the magazine into letting me kick their tires.

    Microport, and other companies. I guarantee many of you have never heard of them.

    Linux distro was [Softlanding Linux System (SLS)](https://archiveos.org/sls/),
    and I couldn't convince my editors – or myself, for that matter – that it was
    reviewable. The first version that I would have reviewed, [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/),
    which is still with us today – was still months in the future.

    [BSD Unix](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/explaining-bsd/), and the [open

    than Unix. In 1993, Unix's competition, if you can call it that, was Windows 3.1
    and NT 3.1.

    or better than Windows PCs. That wasn't the case then. Steve Jobs had been fired,
    and in Apple's 1993 annual report, the company reported its [net income](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/business/company-reports-a-small-profit-for-apple-computer.html)

    for Unix, they were too general to do much good – for example [Portable Operating
    System Interface (POSIX)](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/POSIX-Portable-Operating-System-Interface)
    – or they became mired in the business consortium fights between the Open Systems
    Foundation and Unix International, which became known as the [Unix wars](https://klarasystems.com/articles/unix-wars-the-battle-for-standards/).

    smiling all the way to the bank. The core problem was that the Unix companies
    couldn't settle on software standards. Independent Software Vendors (ISV) had
    to write applications for each Unix platform. Each of these had only a minute
    desktop market share. It simply made no business sense for programmers to write
    one version of an application for SCO OpenDesktop (also known as OpenDeathtrap),
    another for NeXTStep, and still another one for SunOS.

    Group](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) in 1996, it
    was too late. Unix was crowded out on the conventional desktop, and the workstation
    became pretty much a Sun Microsystems-only play.

- en: So, how did Linux come to win? Well, it had two major advantages over the Unix
    distros. The first was that it was open source. In open source's meritocracy,
    the good code survives, and the bad code dies. In particular I credit Linux's
    use of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

    pure BSD operating systems such as [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), [DragonflyBSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/),
    and [GhostBSD](https://ghostbsd.org/). Instead, while the BSD Unix systems are
    still important, they have nothing like Linux's market share.

    of Open Source Supply Chain Security, explained, was the BSD license has been
    troublesome because, every few years, someone says, "[Hey, let's start a company
    based on this BSD code!](https://lwn.net/Articles/197875/)" … They pull the *BSD
    code in, and some of the best BSD developers, and write a proprietary derivative.
    But as a proprietary vendor, their fork becomes expensive to self-maintain, and
    eventually, the company founders. Lather, rinse, repeat.
