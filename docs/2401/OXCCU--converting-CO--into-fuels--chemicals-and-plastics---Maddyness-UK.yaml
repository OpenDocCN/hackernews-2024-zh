- en: '*[OXCCU](https://www.oxccu.com/)* was launched to address the escalating impact
    of greenhouse gas emissions, especially from fossil fuels. Carbon is an incredibly
    useful element, especially when used in hydrocarbons and some sectors have no
    viable alternatives. Using renewable electricity directly is simply not an option.
    Our mission is to enable future generations the continued use of hydrocarbons
    for these sectors but without their climate impact.'

- en: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been proposed as a solution for climate
    change for more than 30 years. However CCS is not without risks to the environment
    and only some countries and sectors can easily implement CCS. Carbon Capture and
    Utilisation (CCU) offers an alternative solution whereby rather than burying the
    CO2, we can repurpose it for various applications, such as producing chemicals,
    fuels, or plastics as we move towards a circular economy.

- en: The utilisation of CO2 is the foundation of our technology. We have developed
    an innovative, one-step process to convert CO2 and H2 directly into jet fuel range
    hydrocarbons, suitable for use as sustainable aviation fuel or as precursors for
    petrochemical products. We combine CO2, either from air, biomass processes or
    industrial processes, with H2 from water and renewable electricity, to produce
    lower carbon or circular fuels, chemicals, and biodegradable plastics.

    of the University of Oxford in 2021\. We specialise in novel catalysts and reactor
    designs to convert CO2 and H2 into hydrocarbons, focusing on sustainable aviation
    fuels (SAF), chemicals, and biodegradable plastics. We have a diverse range of
    partners, including oil companies like ENI and Saudi Aramco, international airlines
    such as United, and commodity trading companies like Trafigura.

    £18M in Series A funding earlier this year and recently received a £2.8M government
    grant to fast track the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Our team has doubled
    over the last year, including key hires to scale operations and deliver demonstration
    plants. Our catalyst stability has been validated in the lab under a wide range
    of conditions and we are now building demo plants to demonstrate performance at
    scale as well as the future potential of our technology. This will be the world’s
    first direct conversion of CO2 to fully deoxygenated jet fuel range hydrocarbons
    at these scales.

- en: One of the significant challenges for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and
    e-hydrocarbons generally is cost competitiveness. To overcome this, we focused
    on developing the one-step catalytic conversion process that significantly reduces
    both capital and operational costs. Independent research from Imperial College
    London has validated our approach, showing a a 50% lower capital cost, and reduced
    operational costs due to higher selectivity yield in the jet fuel range. This
    breakthrough positions our OXEFUEL as a cost-effective and decarbonized alternative
    to fossil-based jet fuel.

- en: The direct Fischer Tropsch conversion of CO2 and H2 to long chain hydrocarbons
    is challenging; other attempts at direct conversion technologies have only been
    able to form undesirable short-chain hydrocarbons and methane, or produce significant
    low value alcohols as byproducts which are expensive to separate from the produced
    water. Hence, the majority have looked instead at first making CO, and then doing
    Fischer Tropsch with the CO and additional H2 (syngas), rather than using CO2
    and H2 directly. However, making CO from CO2 (called Reverse Water Gas Shift or
    RWGS) is a difficult, energy intensive process, and is yet to be scaled commercially.
    Also with CO and H2 (syngas) Fischer Tropsch, you generally make heavy wax which
    needs to be cracked in another energy intensive step.

    and higher costs. Our unique breakthrough catalyst and reactor system, developed
    in OXCCU with world-leading scientists from Oxford University, enables the direct
    formation of jet-fuel range hydrocarbons in a single step. Compared to the other
    indirect routes, such as the two-step process via CO, our direct route is much
    more energy-efficient, selective and scalable and can be easily programmed to
    produce other hydrocarbons or valuable chemicals.

    developers looking to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We will continue to
    innovate and improve our catalyst performance and process, and develop other CO2
    or CO catalysts, enabling the expansion of sustainable hydrocarbons beyond aviation
    fuel, for other fuels, plastics and chemicals, as well as demonstrating integration
    with waste biomass and biogas processes. We will form key partnerships with the
    major players in the engineering, aviation and chemical industries.
