- en: SpaceX is clearly not open to criticism. After receiving a complaint from the
    National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for allegedly firing employees who dared
    to criticize Elon Musk’s behavior, SpaceX decided to double down by suing the
    labor board behind the complaint.

    against the NLRB on Thursday, claiming that the structure of the independent federal

- en: On Wednesday, [NLRB filed a complaint against SpaceX](https://gizmodo.com/spacex-elon-musk-illegally-fired-employees-lawsuit-1851139747)
    for allegedly firing eight employees for writing and distributing an open letter
    that referred to Musk’s public behavior as “distraction and embarrassment” for
    the company. The complaint claims that the employees were fired for activities
    that are protected under the National Labor Relations Act, and a hearing is scheduled
    for March 5 before an administrative law judge of the NLRB.

    company’s “constitutional right to trial by jury.” The company is seeking to block
    the NLRB complaint from going forward. In November 2023, [SpaceX managed to block
    another lawsuit](https://gizmodo.com/spacex-blocks-hiring-discrimination-lawsuit-1851008073)
    filed against it, which [accused the company of hiring discrimination](https://gizmodo.com/spacex-elon-musk-discrimination-lawsuit-refugees-asylum-1850771007)
    against refugees and asylum seekers. The company claimed that the administrative
    judges assigned to anti-immigration bias cases at the Department Of Justice were
    not properly appointed.

    judges. The company’s recent lawsuit also claims that the open letter was a “distraction
    to SpaceX employees around the country.”

- en: “As our CEO and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX—every
    Tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company,” the letter
    read, calling on the company to “swiftly and explicitly separate itself from Elon’s
    personal brand.”

- en: “It is critical to make clear to our teams and to our potential talent pool
    that his messaging does not reflect our work, our mission, or our values,” the
    group of employees wrote in the letter. The letter further advocated the company
    adhere to its “no-asshole” and “zero tolerance” policy by making sure there are
    ways for employees to report bad behavior and punish those responsible for a bad
    working environment, “whether from the CEO or an employee starting their first
    day.”

- en: The NLRB complaint claims that the employees were fired immediately after the
    letter was distributed, and that SpaceX called on others to quit if they disagreed
    with Musk’s behavior. The company also allegedly interrogated, surveilled and
    threatened workers as a result of it, the complaint said.
