    specifically for the U.S., the 3.6-154 delivers the highest efficiency in the
    market, with an optimized size for ease of logistics and installation. The 3.6-154
    is built on the back of the 2.8-127 – the #1 turbine in the world over the last
    two years, according to the Woodmac 2022 OEM report, with more than 200 million
    operating hours of experience. The result of three years of research and development,
    this product is expected to bring recent innovations in turbine and blade design,
    including the digital blade certificate, an AI-trained blade manufacturing process
    designed to produce industry leading quality. The 3.6-154 launches as the most
    tested and validated turbine in GE’s history – a robust turbine to power the domestic
    energy transition.'
