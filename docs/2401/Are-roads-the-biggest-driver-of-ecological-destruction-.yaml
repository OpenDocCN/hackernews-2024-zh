    as a bird, are looking around for predators is a minute when you're not feeding,

    whenever you walk or bike along the highway, you see so many more dead animals,
    especially songbirds and rodents and reptiles. The smaller critters that you wouldn't
    notice inside the cab of an SUV racing along at 70 miles an hour. So I think that's

    is declining. Animal populations are decreasing. We're in the middle of this biodiversity
    crisis and extinction event that is human caused, with cars kind of at the center
    of it in a lot of ways.

    have to be a fundamentally optimistic person. You have to believe your work matters
    and that those negative, discouraging trends are even capable of being reversed.
    Otherwise, why bother?

    Los Angeles over the 101, the busiest freeway on Earth, which disconnects mountain
    lion populations in Southern California. She spent a decade of her life trying
    to get this done. Certainly she wouldn't have done that if she didn't think it
    was possible.

    the highway until finally he was able to convince the Department of Transportation
    to build an underpass for this turtle population, and effectively saved these
    turtles. He was out there every single day, picking up turtles and putting them
    in buckets, and carrying them across four lanes of traffic.

    faces, but they're also fundamentally positive, optimistic people, who believe
    that change is possible, and are willing to work incredibly hard to achieve it.
