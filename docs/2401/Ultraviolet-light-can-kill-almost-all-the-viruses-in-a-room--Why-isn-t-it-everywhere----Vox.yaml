- en: All told, the report estimates that a comprehensive plan to improve air quality,
    including far-UV, upper-room UV, and ventilation/filtration, in every single commercial
    building in the US would require a one-off investment of $214 billion. That’s
    not a small amount, but if businesses can be convinced it’s in their interest
    to pay for a big share of it, that’d go a long way.

  zh: 总的来说，该报告估计，为改善美国每一个商业建筑的空气质量制定一项全面计划，包括远紫外线、上部室内紫外线和通风/过滤，需要一次性投资2140亿美元。这并不是一个小数目，但如果能说服企业认为支付其中大部分费用符合他们的利益，那将产生长远的影响。
- en: 'The hopeful scenario goes a bit like this: A big pilot shows that far-UV works;
    demand soars among rank-and-file businesses; and this makes it financially viable
    for businesses to invest in technological breakthroughs that could make far-UV
    lamps even better. A [number](https://bolb.co/) of [startups](https://www.nsnanotech.com/)
    are [working](https://shortwavelight.com/) [on](https://ledibond.com/tracy-uv-panel/)
    so-called [“solid-state UV,”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020617/) produced
    through LEDs or other non-gaseous light sources. These sources are still experimental
    and not ready for large-scale commercial production. But if they work, they could
    experience price declines akin to those that [ordinary LCDs and LEDs have experienced](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/are-tvs-really-cheaper-than-ever-we-go-back-a-few-decades-to-see/)
    over the years, as TVs and computer monitors have ballooned in size and plummeted
    in cost.'

  zh: 乐观的情景大致如下：一个大型试点表明远紫外线有效；在普通企业中需求激增；这使得企业有了财务上投资技术突破的动力，这些技术突破可能会使远紫外线灯更加优秀。[许多](https://bolb.co/)
    [初创企业](https://www.nsnanotech.com/) [正在研究](https://shortwavelight.com/)所谓的“固态紫外线”，通过LED或其他非气态光源产生。这些光源仍处于实验阶段，尚未准备好大规模商业生产。但如果它们有效，它们可能会经历与[普通LCD和LED](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/are-tvs-really-cheaper-than-ever-we-go-back-a-few-decades-to-see/)类似的价格下降，因为电视和计算机显示器的尺寸增加而价格下降。
- en: That only happened because there were millions, perhaps billions, of customers
    lining up, willing to pay for those products. That isn’t yet true for far-UV.
    And making it true could be a crucial step in starting to make the far-UV dream
    of clean, germ-free air everywhere a reality.

  zh: 这仅仅发生是因为有数百万，甚至可能是数十亿的顾客排队，愿意为那些产品付费。这对于远紫外线来说尚不成立。使其成立可能是开始使远紫外线梦想的清洁、无菌空气到处都成为现实的关键一步。
