    reviewing content and got a lot of questions about sentence length.

    guide") we’re now saying that if you have sentences longer than 25 words, try
    to break them up or condense them. If you can’t, make sure they’re in plain English.

    in a way everybody understands. We know [people distrust jargon](http://aum.sagepub.com/content/27/1/25.short

    showing that when average sentence length is 14 words, readers understand more
    than 90% of what they’re reading. At 43 words, comprehension drops to less than
    10%.

    that sentences of 11 words are considered easy to read, while those of 21 words
    are fairly difficult. At 25 words, sentences become difficult, and 29 words or
    longer, very difficult.'

    have a cognitive disability like dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
    They're also a problem for highly literate people with extensive vocabularies.

    "people tend to scan, not read"). In fact, most people only read around 25% of
    what’s on a page. This means it’s important to get information across quickly.

    your content. And by making it more accessible, you won’t just help your busiest
    readers, you’ll open it up to people who might otherwise struggle to understand
    it.
