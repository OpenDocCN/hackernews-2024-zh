    showing that when average sentence length is 14 words, readers understand more
    than 90% of what they’re reading. At 43 words, comprehension drops to less than
    10%.

    "people tend to scan, not read"). In fact, most people only read around 25% of
    what’s on a page. This means it’s important to get information across quickly.
