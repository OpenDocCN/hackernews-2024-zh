    over two centuries.[¹](#fn1) It’s just that the issues were largely set aside
    in the era of molecular biology due to the expectation that our rapidly growing
    powers of minute analysis would bring full causal understanding. Biology would
    soon be rid of its troublesome language of life in favor of well-behaved molecular
    mechanisms. And yet today, after several decades of stunning progress in molecular
    research, the struggle to fit our understanding of living activity into the comfortable
    garb of familiar causal explanation looks more hopeless than ever.

    painfully self-contradictory language, strongly suggests that a one-sided and
    unrealizable ideal of biological explanation is at work. Under its influence we
    aim to discover a physical lawfulness reflecting, above all, our experience with
    machines — a lawfulness of precise, unambiguous *control*, where one thing can
    be said, without unwelcome qualification, to make another thing happen.

    be a closed system whose intended functioning is more or less immune to contextual
    interference. And we try to do much the same in many scientific demonstrations.
    For example, we can create a vacuum in a chamber, and then release a leaf from
    the top of the chamber. It falls like a stone.

    enables us to observe the singular and lawful play of gravity, without any disturbing
    “interference” from the resistance or movement of air. We can then — and only
    then — say that gravity appears to *make* the leaf fall, just as the simple laws
    governing the gears and springs of a mechanical watch *make* the watch perform
    as a reliable keeper of time.

    as a closed system without interfering factors, the attempt fails miserably. This
    is because, for the animal, *contextual interference is the whole point*. As the
    meaning of its activity shifts from moment to moment, so, too, does the contextual
    significance of all the details of its life.

    form in the distance changes the meaning of everything from the flowers and grass
    the deer was eating, to its own internal digestive processes, to the expression
    of its genes. This happens, not because the distant form is exerting some strange
    physical force upon the deer, but because that form becomes part of a now suddenly
    shifted pattern of meaning.[³](#fn3)

    possible to narrow the conditions of our experiments so severely that a consistent
    “causal arrow” for a particular interaction emerges *under those conditions*.
    But the whole point of life’s adaptability is to seek *altered conditions* according
    to present needs and interests. This is why there can be no fixed syntax, no mechanical
    constancy of relations among the parts. Rather than being a closed system relative
    to this or that cause, the organism is forever abandoning the coordinating principles
    of its old context in favor of a new and ever-changing meaning. Its story is always
    evolving.

    The problem I had in mind was that of getting clear about the very nature of causation
    in biology. It differs from the problem of causation in the physical sciences.
    Organisms manifest a fluid, integral, harmonizing sort of causation that is more
    like a play of the multi-dimensional *reasons* for things than a set of one-dimensional
    mechanical interactions. It is more like the rich interplay of meaning in an unfolding
    poem than a rigid syntax or logic.

    issue remains regarding genomic interactions and genome organization as a cause

    the issue appears irresolvable so long as we insist upon unambiguous physical
    causation as the basis for biological understanding. For the sake of any who may
    not yet be convinced about just how thoroughly the problem of cause and effect
    has bedeviled molecular biologists, I present as a kind of appendix to this chapter
    [Box 9.1](#box_causes), which illustrates the problem with specific reference
    to the molecular biology of gene expression. (You needn’t worry about the technical

    be “held together” according to the functional needs of particular organs. And

    own life. Future-directedness, purposiveness, context-sensitivity, the meaningful
    interweaving of ideas, the subordination of isolated events and physical causes
    to the needs, interests, and purposes of active agents — these features that we
