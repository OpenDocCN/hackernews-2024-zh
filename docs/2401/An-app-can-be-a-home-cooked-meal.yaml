    it has remained steady at four daily active users, with zero churn: a resounding
    success, exceeding every one of its creator’s expectations.'

    and why I made it, both to (a) offer a nudge to anyone else consid­ering a similar
    project, and (b) suggest something a little larger about software.

    of faces, some of them representing individuals, others repre­senting groups.
    My grid had four cells: my mom, my dad, my sister, and a group collecting all
    three. Just like Snapchat or Instagram, you tapped to capture a photo, pressed
    to record a video. As soon as you lifted your finger, your message zipped away,
    with no editing, no reviewing. A “stack” of messages awaited you in the corner,
    and, after you tapped through them, they were discarded.'

    The app didn’t lend itself to practical corre­spon­dence or logis­tical coordination;
    its strength was ambient presence. I met one of Tapstack’s designers once, and
    they told me it seemed espe­cially popular with far-flung families: a diaspora
    app. Because there was no threading and no history, messages didn’t carry the
    burden of an expected reply. Really, they were just a carrier wave for another
    sentiment, and that sentiment was always the same: I’m thinking of you.'

    to show. The app is a “magic window” that captures photos and videos and shuttles
    them around. Messages wait in a queue and, once viewed — <wbr>always full-screen,
    with no distractions, no prods to comment or share — <wbr>they disappear. That
    is literally it. The app has basically no interface. There’s a camera button and
    a badge in the corner, calm green, that indicates how many messages are waiting.

    learn to cook so they can become chefs. Some do! But many more people learn to
    cook so they can eat better, or more affordably. Because they want to carry on
    a tradition. Sometimes they learn because they’re bored! Or even because they
