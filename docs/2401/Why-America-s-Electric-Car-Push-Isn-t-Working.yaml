    already popular — which meant a flood of big electrified SUVs and trucks. But
    massive-bodied EVs don't make much sense. Larger EVs require bigger batteries,
    which require more raw materials to manufacture, which requires producers to beef
    up their [environmentally destructive mining operations](https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-cars-vehicles-solution-climate-change-crisis-dirty-minerals-mining-2022-7).
    While bigger batteries allow drivers to travel farther between charges, they also
    make the cars heavier, [more dangerous](https://www.iihs.org/news/detail/as-heavy-evs-proliferate-their-weight-may-be-a-drag-on-safety),

    EVs don't work as a replacement for gas cars. Niedermeyer said that while an electric
    car can meet most people's driving needs, it struggles with edge cases like road
    trips because of the need to recharge. Since Americans have been promised a one-to-one
    substitute for their gas cars, this seems like a failure; an EV should be able
    to do everything a gas car can. This idea persists even though in 2023 the average
    US driver traveled only about [40 miles a day](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/27/opinion/electric-car-battery-range.html),
    and in 2022 about 93% of US trips were less than 30 miles. Still, in a survey
    conducted by Ipsos last fall, 73% of respondents indicated they had concerns about
    EV range.

    prices. Unlike with gas cars, the more you pay for an EV, the more range you can
    expect to receive. And since Americans have been conditioned to want a lot of
    range, cars with big batteries and longer ranges have dominated the market, resulting
    in stubbornly high prices. In September, Cox Automotive pegged the average EV
    price at $50,683, down 22% from the same time last year. But an analysis from
    CarGurus found that EV prices were still 28% higher than gas-vehicle prices on
    average. With prices for everything else — rent, groceries, and other goods —
    increasing, the average person has less cash to splurge on an expensive electric
    vehicle.

    willing and able to make the shift to electric. They've largely been high-income
    households in places like California, where charging infrastructure is more plentiful.
    The polling firm Strategic Vision found that EV buyers have [a median household
    income of $186,000](https://www.theverge.com/23934889/electric-vehicle-ev-transition-sales-delays-politics).
    Cox estimated that 8% to 9% of new-vehicle sales in the United States in 2023
    would be electric, but getting above that threshold is proving to be more difficult

    then added more when EV technology really took off in the 2010s. EV drivers could
    get perks like free parking, permission to drive in bus lanes, and, most importantly,
    exemptions from taxes and fees that could ultimately save them a lot of money.
    In September, [87% of new-vehicle sales](https://cleantechnica.com/2023/10/04/norways-evs-at-a-record-93-share/)
    were fully electric vehicles. The problem, Ketan Joshi, a climate-analysis expert
    in Oslo, told me, is that that stat "doesn't really give you a good picture of
    the rate of change." Though the new-vehicle sales figure is high, data [from Statistics
    Norway](https://www.ssb.no/en/transport-og-reiseliv/landtransport/statistikk/bilparken)

    from passenger vehicles have fallen slightly, Joshi said, those reductions are
    being canceled out by an increase in emissions from trucks. People in Norway own
    more cars than they have in the past, in part because EV incentives encourage
    people to buy *more* cars, and the government has [no plans](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23939076/norway-electric-vehicle-cars-evs-tesla-oslo)

    a silver bullet, especially on a short timeline. "It shows you the extreme slowness

    Joshi said of Norway's approach. Reducing transportation emissions by incentivizing
    people to replace their car with an EV is incredibly slow. And for countries like
    the US that got started late, it's a warning sign.
