- en: “Courtesy cards,” are cards given out by the NYC police union (and presumably
    elsewhere) to friends and family who use them to get easy treatment if they are
    pulled over by a cop. I was stunned when [I first wrote about these cards in 2018](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/get-jail-free-cards.html).
    I thought this was common only in tinpot dictatorships and flailing states. The
    cards even come in levels, gold, silver and bronze!

  zh: “礼貌卡”是由纽约市警察工会（以及可能其他地方）发放给朋友和家人的卡，他们可以使用这些卡在被警察拉住时获得便利的处理。我在[2018年首次写到这些卡](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/get-jail-free-cards.html)时感到震惊。我以为这种情况只在独裁的小国和摇摇欲坠的国家普遍存在。这些卡甚至分为金、银和铜三个级别！

    issue the ticket or make the arrest in spite of the courtesy card. This is called
    “writing over the card.” There is a chance that the officer who issued the card
    will understand why the enforcement officer did what he did, and nothing will
    come of it. However, it is equally possible that the enforcement officer’s zeal
    will not be appreciated, and the enforcement officer will come to work one day
    to find his locker has been moved to the parking lot and filled with dog excrement.

  zh: …另一种选择可能更加危险。执行官员可以无视礼貌卡而开具罚单或逮捕违规者。这被称为“覆盖卡”。发放卡片的官员可能会理解执行官员的所作所为，不会有任何问题。然而，同样有可能，执行官员的热情不会被理解，执行官员某天会发现他的储物柜已被移到停车场并填满了狗粪。

    police union official, Albert Acierno, got in touch. He told Bianchi that the
    cards were inviolable. He then delivered what Bianchi came to think of as the
    “brother speech,” saying that cops are brothers and must help each other out.
    That the cards were symbols of the bonds between the police and their extended
    family and friends.

    impunity that came with knowing someone on the force, as if New York’s rules didn’t
    apply to those with connections. Over the next four years, he learned about the
    unwritten rules that have come to hold sway in the Police Department.'
