    elsewhere) to friends and family who use them to get easy treatment if they are
    pulled over by a cop. I was stunned when [I first wrote about these cards in 2018](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/01/get-jail-free-cards.html).
    I thought this was common only in tinpot dictatorships and flailing states. The
    cards even come in levels, gold, silver and bronze!

    violator to be more careful, give the card back, and send them on their way.

    issue the ticket or make the arrest in spite of the courtesy card. This is called
    “writing over the card.” There is a chance that the officer who issued the card
    will understand why the enforcement officer did what he did, and nothing will
    come of it. However, it is equally possible that the enforcement officer’s zeal
    will not be appreciated, and the enforcement officer will come to work one day
    to find his locker has been moved to the parking lot and filled with dog excrement.

    discusses the case of Mathew Bianchi, a traffic cop who got sick of letting dangerous
    speeders go when they presented their cards.

    Bianchi these cards six or seven times a day. (**!!!**, AT)

    police union official, Albert Acierno, got in touch. He told Bianchi that the
    cards were inviolable. He then delivered what Bianchi came to think of as the
    “brother speech,” saying that cops are brothers and must help each other out.
    That the cards were symbols of the bonds between the police and their extended
    family and friends.

    impunity that came with knowing someone on the force, as if New York’s rules didn’t
    apply to those with connections. Over the next four years, he learned about the
    unwritten rules that have come to hold sway in the Police Department.'

    police chief Chief Maddrey protect this utterly corrupt system.
