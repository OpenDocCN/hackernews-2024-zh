# Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 is in Development, CEO Eben Upton Confirms | Tom's Hardware

> 来源：[https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-confirmed-by-ceo-eben-upton](https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-confirmed-by-ceo-eben-upton)

Raspberry Pi YouTuber [Jeff Geerling](https://youtu.be/Lky4FSfbc1E) had the chance to interview Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton at [CES](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces). During the interview we hear Upton confirming that Raspberry Pi 5 production is ramping up, and inadvertently we also get first confirmation that the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 is an upcoming product.

At the three minute mark we hear Geerling ask Upton about the Compute Module 5 and Upton replies "Yeah. No, it's happening. I think we've committed CM5 (Compute Module 5) is happening". 

Geerling then talks about a [forum post](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=358183#p2147972) from a Raspberry Pi engineer which alludes to a possible release date of the first half of 2024\. Upton's unintentionally enigmatic response does not confirm when we will see a CM5\. All we get is a simple "Yeah" followed by highlighting that Raspberry Pi has [released guidance](https://pip.raspberrypi.com/categories/944-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5) for those wishing to design products based around the future board. The guidance is not for general distribution, requiring a lengthy sign-up and verification process in order to use the guide.

What we can confirm though is that the Compute Module 5 will share the same dual connectors as the [Compute Module 4](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4). Previous Compute Modules used a SODIMM interface for power and data. With the CM4 we saw dual edge connectors introduced. One of which served power and low-speed interfaces, the other for higher-speed interfaces.

Retaining the dual connector should mean that boards designed around the CM4 should work with the CM5\. The assumption being that the 55 x 40 MM form factor remains the same.

The forward guidance documentation will help to ensure that third-party CM4 boards will have the best chance of compatibility with the Compute Module 5.

## Compute Module 5 Wish-list

The [Compute Module 4](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-compute-module-4) also introduced a plethora of configuration options. With modules ranging in RAM from 1 to 8GB, flash storage from 8 to 32GB and modules with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

The Raspberry Pi 5, like the Raspberry Pi 4 before it, also has multiple RAM options. On release we have 4 and 8GB models on offer, with 1 and 2GB to come in the near future. Logically, the Compute Module 5 should also provide the same RAM, flash storage and Wi-Fi options.

## Compute Module 4

The Compute Module 4, just like the [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-review), hasn't had the best chance of success. Released in late 2022, the Compute Module 4 packs the power of the Raspberry Pi 4 into a smaller form factor. That was great news for all of us eager to pack more power into a project, but it was also released at the tail-end of a pandemic and in the midst of a global chip shortage. For a time, the CM4 and the Zero 2 W were virtually unobtainable. Happily they are now in a more plentiful supply. 

Does the impending CM5 mean that the CM4 is dead and buried? Far from it. According to Raspberry Pi's CM4 Product Brief [[PDF]](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm4/cm4-product-brief.pdf), the board will be in production until 2031\. Don't worry, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W will also remain in production until January 2028 [[PDF]](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rpizero2/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w-product-brief.pdf).

## When can we expect the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5?

With no fixed date, just a vague conversation on a forum as source, we can only speculate that the Compute Module 5 will be with us within a year. But we can confirm that once they are available, there will be a full review on Tom's Hardware.
