- en: One of the more poignant and ridiculous and enduringly popular contemporary
    American insanities is the belief that one person—it's almost always a man, although
    Jennifer Garner [did get to do it in a movie](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/peppermint-reviewed-jennifer-garner-stars-in-an-ignorant-racist-drug-trade-revenge-film)
    once—can make a critical difference in any bad situation, provided that person
    is angry and violent enough. The most crystalline expression of this probably
    came from [bedtime extremist](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-wahlberg-explains-instagram-schedule-jimmy-fallon-video-2018-11)
    and retired rapper Mark Wahlberg, who told *Men's Journal* [back in 2012](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/01/mark-wahlberg-thinks-he-could-have-stopped-911.html)
    that, "if I was on that plane," by which he meant United Flight 93, "it," by which
    he meant the tragic events of September 11, 2001, "wouldn’t have went down like
    it did." In [the apology](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/mark-wahlberg-apologizes-for-saying-he-would-have-prevented-plane-crash-on-911/2012/01/19/gIQAvDvVAQ_blog.html)
    that Wahlberg subsequently issued, he allowed that, "to speculate about such a
    situation is ridiculous to begin with." It absolutely is, but also idle fantasies
    of retribution are something like the national pastime.

    this is "not what you want." For me, though, the many obvious ways in which this
    kind of thing is worrying and bad are secondary to the reason that it is poignant,
    which is the implied faith that any of this is somehow still *up to you*. There's
    a faint stirring of recognition inherent in the fantasy, a sort of loose and loosely
    politicized sense of being betrayed or simply abandoned by the systems or institutions
    that might have prevented the bad thing from happening, and so kept you from having
    to enter Vigilante Mode.

- en: Mostly, though, there is just a small, sad, thwarted wish to make a wrong thing
    right, and to make the powerful parties that hurt you and forgot about you pay
    for having done so. There's some political potential in acknowledging that anger,
    I guess, although it is mostly latent and inchoate, and the shape that it takes—grimly
    but expertly laying waste to a warehouse full of faceless henchmen, generally—reflects
    the limits of the culture's imagination. If the real fantasy at play generally
    boils down, as most contemporary American fantasies do, to [being justified in
    doing whatever](https://defector.com/the-man-who-invented-himself) violent stuff
    you're fantasizing and fulminating about, there is also a melancholy dream of
    agency in it. It's the idea that a person might, despite all the wild recklessness
    and cruelty of full-spectrum social failure rushing down onto them, somehow still
    be able to make sure it Wouldn't Go Down Like That. Put another way, it is easier
    to imagine an endless procession of increasingly expensive and grandiose *John
    Wick* sequels than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.

    four different Boeing-made airplanes in the last week, I can attest to the limits
    of this fantasy in the face of the prospect that a door on your airplane—the production
    of which was outsourced and subcontracted by a flub-prone duopoly to save some
    money; the installation and inspection of which was overseen by an overworked
    and multiply pressured person [working in a conflicted and careless system](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-not-spirit-mis-installed-piece-that-blew-off-alaska-max-9-jet/),
    also to save some money—might blow off at altitude. There are some problems an
    individual is not equipped to fix, and "airplane now has moonroof" is one of the
    classics, there. More to the point, the bad people enabling or actively authoring
    those problems can seem not merely out of reach but safely within a parallel reality
    that is, if not any less brutish or ugly or stupid, notably better insulated.
    You think less of mounting a Jack Reacher-style offensive on Boeing's executive
    suite, in that situation, and more about how strong an airplane seat belt is,
    really, and I guess also how reliable the subcontractor that produced that seatbelt
    was, and how carefully *that* was inspected.

    about Boeing in *The New Republic* that I keep coming back to, both here and in
    general. The central tension of that story is about how, as a former Boeing physicist
    told Tkacik, "a long and proud 'safety culture' was rapidly being replaced...
    with 'a culture of financial bullshit.'" The supplanting of that purpose—of any
    purpose, really, at just about any business in just about any industry you can
    think of—with the blank nihilism of financial capitalism's profit-driven imperatives
    is familiar by now; management's quest to see how much more cheaply an increasingly
    poor product can be sold at the same price and under the same name as what came
    before is, at bottom, the story of basically every industry or institution currently
    in decline or collapse.

    feels more fanciful by the day to imagine a future in which the cynics and sociopaths
    in charge of that market do anything but continue to make it worse; they've evinced
    no capacity for that, but also no interest in it. Whether this deterioration is
    the result of [buccaneering libertarian delusion](https://niedermeyer.io/2023/06/23/we-all-live-in-a-carbon-fiber-submarine/)
    or just a bloodless calculation that concepts like "safety" and "quality" are
    more nice-to-have's than need-to-have's, it appears to be the only idea that any
    of these people have. As this slips further into abstraction—if those mishaps-at-altitude
    don't really ding the stock price enough to bother any of the parties capable
    of doing something about them—the problem compounds and compounds. In the case
    of my industry, there is the sense that the business dipshits smashing up various
    institutions and lives simply care more about their divine right to smash things
    up than they do about anything else; something new can be built around the ruins
    they make, but the needless, ugly, colossal waste of it all is offensive all the
    same. Also none of us know how to make airplanes.

- en: The erosion of Boeing's former, engineer-driven culture and the rise of its
    ravening and reckless financial-capitalism one can be traced, in Tkacik's story,
    in part to Boeing's 1997 purchase of the failing aerospace company McDonnell Douglas.
    The merger was more or less the corporate equivalent of inviting a vampire to
    cross your threshold. The heedless, shortsighted cost-cutting and contingency
    of the smaller and more dysfunctional company took hold at the larger and more
    effective one; little by little, and then all at once, Boeing got to work on making
    its products worse—as much worse as they could be without tanking the stock price,
    and occasionally, tragically, even worse than that.

    told her, too, about his attempts to get through to Wall Street types that shareholders
    were at much greater risk because of that recklessness than they were from the

    He tells Tkacik about a Wall Street analyst telling him: "''Look, I get it. What
    you’re telling me is that your business is *different.* That you’re *special.* Well,

    the world talking like the sort of asshole capitalist who would wreck the world.
    But there is a threat only barely latent in it, too. It''s an inversion of the
    way in which ideas like "everybody is the same" have traditionally been used in
    the culture; where that has typically been deployed, always rhetorically and usually
    insincerely, as a politician''s shorthand for the belief that every life has value
    and every person''s dignity is meaningful, it is here an assertion that every
    life—that every line of work and every person working in it, and every concern
    that those people have—is equally valueless and equally insignificant. It is,
    in its way, a statement of purpose: not just the assurance that every person,
    place, and thing is now or will become food for its rightful devourers, but that
    those doing the eating also think of it as junk food.'

    toured various Senate offices and scowled meaningfully in front of cameras. That
    kind of performance, more than any other more legible aspect, is both how and
    where these people earn their astronomical salaries; the work of squeezing quality
    and dignity and concern out of the labor is automated, or something very near
    to it, but the services of a stern man's face are required in the moments when
    that work delivers the eruptions of tragedy and carnage that it always does. Someone
    has to look ashamed, and also ensure that the shameful stuff doesn't stop, or
    slow.

    problem with every company, and the only effective solution to that problem would
    not just contradict their life's work, but obviate their role as they understand
    and inhabit it. It would not just put them out of a job, but probably put them
    in prison. "I’m more than frustrated and disappointed," *****Alaska Airlines CEO
    Ben Minicucci [told NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/alaska-airlines-found-more-loose-bolts-boeing-737-max-9-ceo-says-rcna135316)

    his cohort have *no idea*—no idea how much anger there is about what they have
    done to make every aspect of life flatter and crueler and riskier and worse, and
    no idea how lucky they are that all that rage is still being pointed in, and not
    up.
