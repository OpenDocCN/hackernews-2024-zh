    American insanities is the belief that one person—it's almost always a man, although
    Jennifer Garner [did get to do it in a movie](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/peppermint-reviewed-jennifer-garner-stars-in-an-ignorant-racist-drug-trade-revenge-film)
    once—can make a critical difference in any bad situation, provided that person
    is angry and violent enough. The most crystalline expression of this probably
    came from [bedtime extremist](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-wahlberg-explains-instagram-schedule-jimmy-fallon-video-2018-11)
    and retired rapper Mark Wahlberg, who told *Men's Journal* [back in 2012](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/01/mark-wahlberg-thinks-he-could-have-stopped-911.html)
    that, "if I was on that plane," by which he meant United Flight 93, "it," by which
    he meant the tragic events of September 11, 2001, "wouldn’t have went down like
    it did." In [the apology](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/mark-wahlberg-apologizes-for-saying-he-would-have-prevented-plane-crash-on-911/2012/01/19/gIQAvDvVAQ_blog.html)
    that Wahlberg subsequently issued, he allowed that, "to speculate about such a
    situation is ridiculous to begin with." It absolutely is, but also idle fantasies
    of retribution are something like the national pastime.

  zh: 当代美国最令人心酸、荒谬且持久受欢迎的一种信念是，一个人——几乎总是男性，尽管詹妮弗·加纳[曾经在一部电影中](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/peppermint-reviewed-jennifer-garner-stars-in-an-ignorant-racist-drug-trade-revenge-film)扮演过这种角色——可以在任何糟糕的情况下起到至关重要的作用，只要这个人足够愤怒和暴力。这种信念的最明确表达可能来自于“睡前极端分子”和退役说唱歌手马克·沃尔伯格，他在[2012年对《男士杂志》](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/01/mark-wahlberg-thinks-he-could-have-stopped-911.html)说，“如果我在那架飞机上”，他指的是美国联合航空93号航班，“它”，他指的是2001年9月11日的悲剧事件，“不会像那样发生。”沃尔伯格随后发表的[道歉声明](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/mark-wahlberg-apologizes-for-saying-he-would-have-prevented-plane-crash-on-911/2012/01/19/gIQAvDvVAQ_blog.html)中承认，“猜测这种情况是荒谬的”。确实如此，但报复的空想也是一种类似于全民运动的东西。
- en: In all kinds of ways, from broader social cohesion to individual mental health,
    this is "not what you want." For me, though, the many obvious ways in which this
    kind of thing is worrying and bad are secondary to the reason that it is poignant,
    which is the implied faith that any of this is somehow still *up to you*. There's
    a faint stirring of recognition inherent in the fantasy, a sort of loose and loosely
    politicized sense of being betrayed or simply abandoned by the systems or institutions
    that might have prevented the bad thing from happening, and so kept you from having
    to enter Vigilante Mode.

- en: Mostly, though, there is just a small, sad, thwarted wish to make a wrong thing
    right, and to make the powerful parties that hurt you and forgot about you pay
    for having done so. There's some political potential in acknowledging that anger,
    I guess, although it is mostly latent and inchoate, and the shape that it takes—grimly
    but expertly laying waste to a warehouse full of faceless henchmen, generally—reflects
    the limits of the culture's imagination. If the real fantasy at play generally
    boils down, as most contemporary American fantasies do, to [being justified in
    doing whatever](https://defector.com/the-man-who-invented-himself) violent stuff
    you're fantasizing and fulminating about, there is also a melancholy dream of
    agency in it. It's the idea that a person might, despite all the wild recklessness
    and cruelty of full-spectrum social failure rushing down onto them, somehow still
    be able to make sure it Wouldn't Go Down Like That. Put another way, it is easier
    to imagine an endless procession of increasingly expensive and grandiose *John
    Wick* sequels than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.

  zh: 大多数时候，只是一个小小的、悲伤的、受挫的愿望，希望把错误的事情变得正确，并让那些伤害你、忘记你的强大团体为此付出代价。我猜，承认那种愤怒可能有一些政治潜力，尽管它大多是潜在的、零碎的，而它所呈现的形式——冷酷但技术娴熟地摧毁一个仓库里的无名手下，一般来说——反映了文化想象力的局限性。如果通常所谓的真正幻想归结为，就像大多数当代美国幻想那样，[在幻想和愤怒中有理由做任何暴力行为](https://defector.com/the-man-who-invented-himself)，那么其中也有一种忧郁的代理权梦想。这个想法是，一个人可能会在所有野性的鲁莽和残酷以及全方位社会失败的压力下，仍然能够确保事情不会那样发展。换句话说，人们更容易想象无尽的越来越昂贵、越来越宏伟的*约翰·威克*续集，而不是想象资本主义的终结。
- en: But sometimes it is easier to imagine than others. As someone who has been on
    four different Boeing-made airplanes in the last week, I can attest to the limits
    of this fantasy in the face of the prospect that a door on your airplane—the production
    of which was outsourced and subcontracted by a flub-prone duopoly to save some
    money; the installation and inspection of which was overseen by an overworked
    and multiply pressured person [working in a conflicted and careless system](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-not-spirit-mis-installed-piece-that-blew-off-alaska-max-9-jet/),
    also to save some money—might blow off at altitude. There are some problems an
    individual is not equipped to fix, and "airplane now has moonroof" is one of the
    classics, there. More to the point, the bad people enabling or actively authoring
    those problems can seem not merely out of reach but safely within a parallel reality
    that is, if not any less brutish or ugly or stupid, notably better insulated.
    You think less of mounting a Jack Reacher-style offensive on Boeing's executive
    suite, in that situation, and more about how strong an airplane seat belt is,
    really, and I guess also how reliable the subcontractor that produced that seatbelt
    was, and how carefully *that* was inspected.

    about Boeing in *The New Republic* that I keep coming back to, both here and in
    general. The central tension of that story is about how, as a former Boeing physicist
    told Tkacik, "a long and proud 'safety culture' was rapidly being replaced...
    with 'a culture of financial bullshit.'" The supplanting of that purpose—of any
    purpose, really, at just about any business in just about any industry you can
    think of—with the blank nihilism of financial capitalism's profit-driven imperatives
    is familiar by now; management's quest to see how much more cheaply an increasingly
    poor product can be sold at the same price and under the same name as what came
    before is, at bottom, the story of basically every industry or institution currently
    in decline or collapse.

- en: If it was always foolish to expect the free market to make things better, it
    feels more fanciful by the day to imagine a future in which the cynics and sociopaths
    in charge of that market do anything but continue to make it worse; they've evinced
    no capacity for that, but also no interest in it. Whether this deterioration is
    the result of [buccaneering libertarian delusion](https://niedermeyer.io/2023/06/23/we-all-live-in-a-carbon-fiber-submarine/)
    or just a bloodless calculation that concepts like "safety" and "quality" are
    more nice-to-have's than need-to-have's, it appears to be the only idea that any
    of these people have. As this slips further into abstraction—if those mishaps-at-altitude
    don't really ding the stock price enough to bother any of the parties capable
    of doing something about them—the problem compounds and compounds. In the case
    of my industry, there is the sense that the business dipshits smashing up various
    institutions and lives simply care more about their divine right to smash things
    up than they do about anything else; something new can be built around the ruins
    they make, but the needless, ugly, colossal waste of it all is offensive all the
    same. Also none of us know how to make airplanes.

- en: The erosion of Boeing's former, engineer-driven culture and the rise of its
    ravening and reckless financial-capitalism one can be traced, in Tkacik's story,
    in part to Boeing's 1997 purchase of the failing aerospace company McDonnell Douglas.
    The merger was more or less the corporate equivalent of inviting a vampire to
    cross your threshold. The heedless, shortsighted cost-cutting and contingency
    of the smaller and more dysfunctional company took hold at the larger and more
    effective one; little by little, and then all at once, Boeing got to work on making
    its products worse—as much worse as they could be without tanking the stock price,
    and occasionally, tragically, even worse than that.
