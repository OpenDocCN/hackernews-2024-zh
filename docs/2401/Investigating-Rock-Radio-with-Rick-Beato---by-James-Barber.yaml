    were a public asset that needed to be managed by the government in the interest

    radio play as a promotion tool for record companies. Based on the business entities

    records on air in the years before and during World War II, insisting that stations
    were taking jobs away from the musicians that had previously been paid to perform

    no one could book a recording session with AFM members, we ended up with some

- en: All of that is a windup to my conspiracy theory, one that’s entirely my own

    Congress to investigate what was going on with payments to radio stations in the
    late 1950s because they were still pissed off about losing their jobs after WWII.
    It’s hard to imagine now, but rock and roll music was the major cultural force

  zh: 当然，也许情况更糟糕，因为至少有一个参与电台节目策划的人对摇滚音乐的品味如此糟糕，但即使是像我或者Rick这样的人掌管，情况也会很糟糕。每个人都有自己的盲点，在摇滚乐风靡的那些年里，正是各种声音的竞争帮助最优秀的乐队脱颖而出。

    and crackpot ideas that made the label industry so much fun. Did everyone bend
    the rules? Sure, but a lot of those shenanigans were only dubious because of the
    particular rules that governed radio licensees in the 20th century.

- en: Rick decided to add some more commentary to the video about producers requiring
    a label to rent their outboard gear or amps for a recording project. I just want
    to make sure that I add that the practice started because *some* producers really
    did bring their own rack of gear that they actually used to brew their own special
    studio sauce.

  zh: Rick决定在视频中再增加一些关于制作人要求厂牌租用他们的户外设备或音响设备进行录音项目的评论。我只是想确保我补充说，这种做法的起源是因为*一些*制作人确实带了自己的设备架，而且确实用来调制他们自己的特殊工作室酱料。
- en: Studios generally went out and bought whatever they saw in a producer’s rack
    so they wouldn’t lose business because they didn’t have the exact piece of gear
    they wanted. Eventually, that should have eliminated the need for producers to
    bring their own stuff.

- en: Have I ever worked on a project where rental of the producer’s road case of
    outboard gear was being charged to the recording budget and that same road case
    was never opened? Of course. And let’s not forget the outrageous shipping costs
    required to get that road case to the studio and back to the producer’s storage
    space after the project was over. All expenses charged to the artist’s budget
    and royalty account, so label execs weren’t especially motivated to crack down
    on the practice.

  zh: 我是否曾参与过一个项目，其中制作人的户外设备箱租金被收入录音预算，而那个箱子从未被打开过？当然。还有不要忘记为了让那个箱子从录音棚运回制作人的储藏空间所需的昂贵的运输成本。所有费用都计入艺术家的预算和版税账户，因此唱片公司高管并不特别有动力制止这种做法。

    I named it after the great James Hunter’s open letter to the label industry circa
    1985\. Mr. Hunter may not have become the live concert titan he aspired to be,
    but listening to his tape always reminds me that hope is the core of our business.
    That, and the shows that make people sway.
