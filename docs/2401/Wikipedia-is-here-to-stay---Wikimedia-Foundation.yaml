- en: This week, Wikipedia celebrates its twenty-third birthday. In that time, the
    online encyclopedia has become one of the top ten most popular websites in the
    world, with over 15 billion visits a month. Despite the changes to the internet
    over the last two decades, from Web 1.0 to our current era of the world wide web,
    from smartphones to the rise of artificial intelligence, Wikipedia [continues
    to thrive](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/magazine/wikipedia-ai-chatgpt.html).

    Machine Learning. I’ve worked in data and machine learning my entire career. My
    background and skill set is in data, computation, and algorithms — understanding
    it and using it.

    that Wikipedia is built by people and for the people, and it is here to stay.

    every image, and every word in every article is a person — a person with a life,
    with family, friends, and pressures on their time.

- en: For over twenty years and multiple times a second as you read this, thousands
    of people are spending their time building a global commons of freely available,
    neutral, reliable information for the world. That is why, despite the rapid changes
    the internet has gone through, the online encyclopedia remains relevant.

- en: The internet is not static. It is an evolving set of technologies, cultures,
    and norms. And just like it has since its start, Wikipedia will evolve with the
    internet. For example, Wikipedia volunteers have used machine learning for years
    to help [detect vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ClueBot_NG), [translate
    articles](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/06/13/mint-supporting-underserved-languages-with-open-machine-translation/),
    and [provide a better experience for editing](https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2022/12/06/new-wikipedia-editor-features-make-it-easy-for-everyone-to-contribute/).

    will continue to build new AI tools making Wikipedia better – more reliable and
    accessible to everyone.

- en: One thing that will never change is our fundamental belief that Wikipedia comes
    from its editors. The foreseeable future remains that a large group of humans
    working together — debating, discussing, fact-checking each other, even when using
    AI to boost their efforts — will be the best way to create reliable knowledge.

- en: The news is filled with stories on advances in artificial intelligence. There
    are ways of interacting with information on the web that people would not have
    dreamed of a few years ago. But as the internet is flooded with AI-generated content
    (some of it good, much of it bad) the value of an individual human volunteer,
    spending their evenings after the kids are asleep or after they get off from their
    job, building and improving the knowledge commons that is Wikipedia, will only
    become more important.

    else after that. Still, the work of Wikipedia and its volunteers to build a reliable
    resource of information freely for the world will continue. Wikipedia is here
    to stay.
