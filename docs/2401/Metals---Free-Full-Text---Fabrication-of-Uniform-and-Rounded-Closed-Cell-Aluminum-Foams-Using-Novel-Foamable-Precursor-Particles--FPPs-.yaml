    melt route where pores are stabilized by the addition of ceramic particles, in
    a powder-based route, metal powders inherently contain surface oxides, and hence
    externally added ceramic powders are not needed. We also noted that the FPPs were
    produced through the process of mechanical milling, although the milling was conducted
    in an argon environment, it is impossible to eliminate all the oxygen and hence
    the presence of oxygen is still expected during milling. As powders are impacted
    by the balls, the passivating alumina nano surface layers on aluminum powders
    are broken, thus exposing the virgin metal surface, which then becomes oxidized
    due to the presence of the residual oxygen, resulting in an increased oxide content.
    This is in line with recent published results, where mechanical milling has been
    shown to lead to a local increase in the oxide content of milled aluminum powder
