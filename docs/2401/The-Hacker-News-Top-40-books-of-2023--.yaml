- en: Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads. I enjoy reading [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
    and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than
    doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?! It
    also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting.

    That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get “ask HN” stories, by excluding
    stories that have a url in them.

    converted to “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. Any leading “the” is also removed. I end up
    with a title column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have
    the same title, but different subtitles, for example “Javascript: the good parts”
    and “Javascript: the Definitive Guide”, this isn’t too much of a problem, as the
    authors are different.'

    the book titles and authors names, for example Gödel was sometimes spelled “Godel”
    and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as “Douglas R. Hofstadter”.

    Cantos. I don’t usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so
    good, and the science fiction elements are cool too.

    new biography wasn’t recommended once in an “Ask HN” about books, although there
    were plenty of stories on Hacker News about him and Isaacson’s book. Also Ayn
    Rand’s books weren’t mentioned often enough in 2023 to make the list.'
