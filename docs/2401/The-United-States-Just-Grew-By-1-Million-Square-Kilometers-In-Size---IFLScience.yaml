- en: Just a few weeks ago, the United States grew in size by 1 million square kilometers
    (more than 386,000 square miles) – that’s almost twice the area of Spain. The
    unexpected growth spurt was not the result of [strange geological forces](https://www.iflscience.com/a-new-island-has-been-born-off-the-coast-of-japan-in-the-pacific-71461),
    nor the invasion of a foreign land, but the States attempting to lay claim to
    its surrounding ocean-floor territory.

    the sea is relatively shallow compared with the open ocean. Under international
    law, countries can claim these continental shelves, allowing them to manage and

    limits, which refers to the portion of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
    miles (230 miles) from the coast. Until now, the US has not done this.

    (west coast), Mariana Islands, and two areas in the Gulf of Mexico. In total,
    this consumes an area that''s 1 million square kilometers (more than 386,000 square

    [Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/arctic-horizons-primer-and-critical-questions-extending-us-territory-arctic-ocean?fbclid=IwAR17SbAvR4QnZZdXcbKsGfcQROBtYmDwA2pgQO3CZFxcR7Z2pDqD3gvLRdg).
    To make the definition official, the US has to submit data and reports to the
    United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, the US has not
    ratified UNCLOS due to complex political disagreements (the agreement has been
    ratified by 168 states and the European Union).

    international stage. Some of the [most significant geopolitical spats ](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/chinas-maritime-disputes)in

    of ocean floor territory in the Arctic Ocean could open up the area for further
    mining, shipping, and fishing – despite the potential damage [it could spark](https://www.iflscience.com/global-powers-agree-to-refrain-from-fishing-in-arctic-ocean-for-16-years-to-conduct-research-first-44973).
