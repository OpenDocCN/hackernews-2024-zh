    Barcelona’s Glòries tower, where the content moderation offices for the Californian
    tech giant are located. He sat staring blankly at a ping pong table. The fun floor
    didn’t help him at all. On another occasion, two hours after he had another panic
    attack, his boss gave him permission to go see a company psychologist. She was
    on another floor, the psychology floor. He spent over half an hour talking to

    important to society, that they were all heroes, that he should be stronger. And

- en: The company began to hire people — primarily young foreigners who spoke several
    languages — to moderate content from different markets. Last October, an investigation
    by *La Vanguardia* exposed the conditions under which these moderators work. Before
    that, Catalonia’s Labor Inspectorate launched an investigation in 2021, and the
    following year imposed a fine of over €40,000 ($43,314) on the company for deficiencies
    in the evaluation and prevention of psychosocial risks in the workplace. In 2020,
    the company was acquired by Canadian Telus International, which claims that the
    accusations are false and that they have sufficient safety measures in place.

    medical leave for his mental health problems. The company and the mutual insurance
    company classified it as a common illness. “We then requested a change of contingencies,
    because his case fit perfectly with that of occupational accident. The National
    Institute of Social Security agreed with us, and the company appealed, which triggered
    the legal process,” explains Francesc Feliu, a partner in the law firm Espacio

    and ruled that the worker’s sick leave should be classified as an accident at
    work. This is the first judgment that recognizes that the mental illness a content
    moderator suffers is caused by his work. “[Work-related stress](https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-03-11/when-one-can-work-no-more-the-effects-of-burnout-on-your-body.html)
    is the sole, exclusive and unquestionable trigger” of the disorders, says the
    ruling, which can still be appealed. Feliu has some 25 other workers who are waiting
    for their illness to be recognized as an occupational accident, and in October
    he also filed a criminal complaint against the company, alleging the lack of safety
    measures.

    are salary differences between workers who are responsible for different markets,
    for which another office has also gone to court), no experience or training is
    required, and young foreigners are attracted to it: “They say ‘look, how cool,

    this makes you more sensitive to everything. After a while I couldn’t even see
    a suicide letter,” he explains. You had to strictly follow Meta’s policy, and
    often watch the videos to the end, several times with different moderators. “For
    example, you had to keep watching a live video of someone explaining that they
    wanted to commit suicide, and you couldn’t delete it or alert the police if you
    didn’t see something in the scene that suggested suicide, a gun, an open window....

    video by the worst thing that happened [in it], according to a scale. If the video
    started with some kind of violence, you had to wait for something more serious,
    like murder, dismemberment or sexual abuse, to rate it as the most serious. If

    is violent at second 10, why do you have to wait? You come to the conclusion that
    what they are doing is training artificial intelligence (AI), that [workers] are

    The works council has not responded to questions from this newspaper, and the
    company has appealed the ruling. In a statement, Telus explains that “thanks to
    the comprehensive wellness program,” in December of last year, it had reduced
    sick leave to 14% of the workforce, and that only “between 1% and 2%” were work-related
