    the biologist [William R. Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Thompson) in

    do both things at the same time. When you explore, you are pulling new arms on
    the bandit trying to figure out their expected payout. When you exploit, you pull
    the best arm you’ve found. You need to find the right balance. If you spend too
    little time exploring, you get stuck playing a machine with a low expected payoff.

    you played the best arm. This is the explore/exploit trade-off.

  zh: 但除了做一个父亲之外，我不知道该怎么处理我的生活。在游泳并思考我在这篇文章中所说的事情时，我做出了决定。我要以算法的方式来处理我的情况。我将应用规则来决定何时探索，何时利用，以抵消我自然的倾向（它会让我两者都做得太少）。
- en: 'There are several algorithmic solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem,
    going back to Thompson sampling in the 1930s, all the way up to contemporary algorithms
    used in machine learning, such as EXP3 and Upper Confidence Bounds. What they
    all have in common is some version of: 1) prioritize exploration early on and
    2) dial up exploitation as the situation becomes more clear. If you are new in
    a city, it makes sense to meet as many people as possible. If you find someone
    you love hanging with early, you will have years of happiness. But if you are
    about to leave, it makes more sense to hang with your best friends. Even if you
    found someone you liked more, you wouldn’t have any time to hang out. The amount
    of exploration that is optimal depends on the complexity of the problem and the
    time horizon.'

  zh: 对于多臂赌博问题，存在几种算法解决方案，从上世纪30年代的汤普森抽样法，一直到机器学习中使用的当代算法，如EXP3和置信上界。它们的共同点在于某种形式的：优先在早期进行探索，并在情况变得更清晰时增加利用。如果你是一个城市的新手，尽可能地认识更多人是有意义的。如果你早早就找到了一个喜欢与之相处的人，你将会拥有多年的幸福。但如果你即将离开，与你最好的朋友们呆在一起更有意义。即使你找到了更喜欢的人，你也没有时间再呆在一起。最优探索量取决于问题的复杂性和时间范围。
- en: What I decided to do was this. I would divide the next 30 months into three
    parts. For the first ten months, I would allow myself to explore freely. After
    that, I’d switch to exploring 2/3 of the time and using 1/3 to double down on
    the most interesting opportunity I had found, then I’d do 1/3 exploring and 2/3
    exploiting, and so on.

  zh: 我决定要做的是这样的。我将接下来的30个月划分为三个部分。在接下来的十个月里，我将允许自己自由探索。之后，我会切换到用2/3时间来探索，用1/3时间加倍专注于我发现的最有趣的机会，然后我会用1/3时间探索，2/3时间利用，依此类推。
- en: 'We can think of the amount of time I spent on explorative open-ended search
    as my “temperature.” When you heat atoms, they bounce around faster; when you
    heat a life, it becomes more explorative. When you cool it, you narrow down and
    spend more time exploiting what you know. Here’s what it looks like when you search
    for the highest peak while gradually reducing the “temperature”:'

  zh: 我们可以将我在探索性开放式搜索上花费的时间视为我的“温度”。当你加热原子时，它们会跳动得更快；当你加热生活时，它会变得更具探索性。当你冷却时，你会缩小范围并花更多时间利用你所知道的。当你搜索最高峰时，逐渐降低“温度”的效果如下：
- en: Notice that the search starts in the area to the right, which does not contain
    the highest peak. If it had been a focused search early on it would have gotten
    stuck at a local optimum. (This is one of the reasons why education is a nightmare
    for many, by the way. Schooling forces you to decide what you will pursue long
    before you get to try it. It makes your future, more knowledgeable self, the servant
    of the younger, ignorant self.)

  zh: 请注意，搜索是从右边的区域开始的，该区域并不包含最高峰。如果早期进行了专注的搜索，它就会卡在局部最优点上。（顺便说一句，这也是为什么对许多人来说教育是一场噩梦的原因。学校迫使你在尝试之前就决定你将追求什么。它让你的未来更有知识的自己成为年幼无知的自己的仆人。）
- en: It felt comforting to put strict rules on myself like this, especially in the
    early part of the search. I felt stressed that I would not find the right thing
    to spend my time on and support my family. This made me want to go into exploit
    mode too soon. Knowing that there would be a time for focus later made me more
    willing to try anything and fail. I learned the piano and played around with coding.
    I wrote a few chapters of a novel. I got involved with a kindergarten/goat farm
    and studied the history of the island. I took a job at an art gallery.

  zh: 像这样给自己制定严格规则让我感到安慰，特别是在搜索的早期阶段。我担心自己找不到正确的事情来花费时间并支持我的家庭。这让我想过早进入利用模式。知道以后会有时间专注让我更愿意尝试任何事情并失败。我学习了钢琴并尝试编程。我写了几章小说。我参与了一个幼儿园/羊场并研究了岛屿的历史。我在艺术画廊工作过。

- en: The next time I dialed down the temperature I had started this blog. Since writing
    it was more interesting than programming, I stopped coding and switched 2/3s of
    my spare time to the blog. In retrospect, this seems like an obvious choice. Writing
    had always been my main obsession. But it wasn’t obvious at the time. I had for
    years been frustrated that no one was interested in what I wrote. The magazines
    that had published me when I was in my early twenties wanted nothing to do with
    the stuff I was exploring now. Writing seemed like a dead end.

  zh: 下一次我降低温度时，我开始了这个博客。 因为写作比编程更有趣，所以我停止了编码，并将我的三分之二的业余时间转移到了博客上。 回顾起来，这似乎是一个显而易见的选择。
    写作一直是我的主要迷恋。 但当时并不明显。 多年来，我一直为没有人对我写的东西感兴趣而感到沮丧。 在我二十多岁时发表我的杂志对我感兴趣的东西与我现在探索的东西无关。
    写作似乎是一条死路。
- en: I didn’t tell anyone that I was writing a blog. Having my friends read it would
    have made it harder for me to experiment and do things that risked embarrassment
    or failure. I wanted to put myself in a social context where I was rewarded for

    on a peak I could not have imagined when we arrived on the island: being on track

    2024 年底，这些文章将成为我们的主要收入来源）。
