    all my interactions with peers, no other topic caused as much cynicism and angst
    as the question of performance management — that is, the labyrinthine processes
    the companies follow to decide who to fire and who to reward for exemplary work.

- en: 'Much of this anxiety arises from the belief that Big Tech wants to instill
    a cutthroat environment where you’re always compelled to do your best. I don’t
    think that’s true: in rapidly growing companies with easy access to funding, there
    is no intrinsic incentive to fire mediocre staff. The process is stressful to
    managers, legally risky, and harmful to morale. The loss of institutional knowledge
    is a problem, too. The tendency to accumulate slack is precisely why profitable
    tech companies panic and go through overdue layoffs whenever the economic outlook
    turns for the worse.'

- en: The actual reason for performance management is that your employees are sticklers
    for fairness. The exact dollar figure on your paycheck matters a lot less than
    knowing there’s another person who does less and somehow earns more. As a manager,
    in a good proportion of 1:1s, you hear your subordinates comparing themselves
    to others and asking you to explain any perceived slights. Harboring low performers
    has corrosive effects on team dynamics — doubly so in places that attract talent
    through the mythos of only hiring the best.

- en: 'For a long time, the prevailing corporate approach to performance management
    was to let the manager decide. After all, they had the expertise and the familiarity
    with the problem space, so it was believed that they’re best equipped to dole
    out punishment and deliver rewards. But this led to problems: some teams developed
    a reputation for leniency, and others for being too harsh. More insidiously, the
    setup allowed rumors to spread: a manager could be accused of giving preferential
    treatment to their buddies or love interests, with no way to disprove such claims;
    every company sooner or later developed extensive lore of this sort.'

    differently, and reinventing performance management seemed like fair game. The
    firm ultimately converged on a peer-based system where your performance is evaluated
    not by your boss, but by a selection of your coworkers. This promised greater
    fairness and improved transparency. Over the years, the model spread like a wildfire
    to other tech companies — and sometimes beyond.

    or twice a year, the entire business would grind to a halt with every employee
    writing self-assessments and peer feedback; after that, a significant proportion
    of senior staff would disappear to serve on committees while the underlings anxiously
    awaited results. But the benefits seemed obvious — and well worth the price.'

- en: Except, the benefits never really materialized. The problem is that every employee
    is judged by their ability to get work done; in most roles, this depends on being
    able to get along with others, including strangers with different sensibilities
    and unfamiliar backgrounds. Providing honest, critical feedback is a significant
    and ultimately unnecessary social risk. It doesn’t help that the burden of the
    process prompts most to put the bare minimum of effort into individual reviews;
    a handful of platitudes is usually enough to get you through it and get back to
    work.

    — and uniformly bland. The usual exceptions are the absolute worst performers
    who wouldn’t survive under any other performance management regime; as well as
    a handful of unlucky folks who deliver solid results but lack social grace and
    self-promotion skills.

    the managers are tasked with “interpreting” the feedback to arrive at some sort
    of a normalized ranking that can be used as a basis for firings, promotions, and
    bonuses. This happens behind the scenes in stuffy multi-hour meetings where the
    data is shuffled and massaged until it fits on some reasonable curve. The illusion
    of a peer-driven system is maintained — but in reality, for layoffs and compensation,
    the manager almost always makes the call. The actual peer feedback is of little
    consequence.

    the final decision is delegated to an independent committee of senior employees.
    The panel is unlikely to promote if the manager doesn’t support the bid, but having
    your manager’s blessing doesn’t guarantee success. The goal is to maintain a consistently
    high bar, but this too comes at a hefty price. The committee must decipher voluminous
    but sloppy feedback without the benefit of knowing the nominees or understanding
    their work. Too often, the verdicts diverge from the intrinsic merit of the case.
    “You’re doing great, we just need to structure your packet differently for the
    next cycle” is a common saying when delivering the bad news.'

    process isn’t necessarily any better than that of what it sought to replace. At
    a great cost, we merely traded the accusations of manager-level favoritism for
    grander conspiracy theories — sinister corporate agendas divined from the garbled
    words of secretive, shapeless committees.

    the mythos of Big Tech; but it’s also a fascinating study of painting oneself
    into a corner, unable to walk back.
