- en: You’re familiar with Karel Čapek, right? If not, you should be—he’s the guy
    who (along with his brother Josef) invented the word “robot.” Čapek introduced
    robots to the world in 1921, when his play “*R.U.R.*” (subtitled “Rossum’s Universal
    Robots”) was first performed in Prague. It was performed in New York City the
    next year, and by the year after that, it had been translated into 30 languages.
    Translated, that is, except for the word “robot” itself, which originally described
    artificial humans but within a decade of its introduction came to mean things
    that were mechanical and electronic in nature.

    and in 1935, he wrote a column in the [*Lidové noviny*](https://www.lidovky.cz/)
    “defending” his vision of what robots should be, while also resigning himself
    to what they had become. A new translation of this column is included as an afterword
    in a new English translation of *R.U.R.* that is accompanied by 20 essays exploring
    [robotics](https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/), philosophy, politics, and
    AI in the context of the play, and it makes for fascinating reading.

    is edited by [Jitka Čejková](https://droplets.vscht.cz/people/cejkova), a professor
    at the [Chemical Robotics Laboratory](https://chobotix.cz/) at the University
    of Chemistry and Technology Prague, whose research interests arguably make her
    one of the most qualified people to write about Čapek’s perspective on robots.
    “The chemical robots in the form of microparticles that we designed and investigated,
    and that had properties similar to living cells, were much closer to Čapek’s original
    ideas than any other robots today,” Čejková explains in the book’s introduction.
    These microparticles can exhibit surprisingly complex autonomous behaviors under
    specific situations, like solving simple mazes:'

    robots were artificial human beings that only looked like humans and could imitate
    only certain characteristics and behaviors of humans, so liquid robots, as artificial
    cells, only partially imitate the behavior of their living counterparts.”

    seem to try to avoid, but personally, I appreciate the idea that very broadly,
    a robot is something that seems alive but isn’t—something with independent embodied
    intelligence. Perhaps the requirement that a robot is mechanical and electronic
    *is* too strict, although as Čapek himself realized 100 years ago, what defines
    a robot has escaped from the control of anyone, even its creator. Here then is
    his column from 1935, excerpted from *R.U.R. and the Vision of Artificial Life*,
    released just today:'

    hands against a certain popularity that has befallen something which is called
    his spiritual brainchild; for that matter, he is aware that by doing so he can
    no longer change a thing. The author was silent a goodly time and kept his own
    counsel, while the notion that robots have limbs of metal and innards of wire
    and cogwheels (or the like) has become current; he has learned, without any great
    pleasure, that genuine steel robots have started to appear, robots that move in
    various directions, tell the time, and even fly airplanes; but when he recently
    read that, in Moscow, they have shot a major film, in which the world is trampled
    underfoot by mechanical robots, driven by electromagnetic waves, he developed
    a strong urge to protest, at least in the name of his own robots. For his robots
    were not mechanisms. They were not made of sheet metal and cogwheels. They were
    not a celebration of mechanical engineering. If the author was thinking of any
    of the marvels of the human spirit during their creation, it was not of technology,
    but of science. With outright horror, he refuses any responsibility for the thought
    that machines could take the place of people, or that anything like life, love,
    or rebellion could ever awaken in their cogwheels. He would regard this somber
    vision as an unforgivable overvaluation of mechanics or as a severe insult to
    life.

- en: 'The author of the robots appeals to the fact that he must know the most about
    it: and therefore he pronounces that his robots were created quite differently—that
    is, by a chemical path. The author was thinking about modern chemistry, which
    in various emulsions (or whatever they are called) has located substances and
    forms that in some ways behave like living matter. He was thinking about biological
    chemistry, which is constantly discovering new chemical agents that have a direct
    regulatory influence on living matter; about chemistry, which is finding—and to
    some extent already building—those various enzymes, hormones, and vitamins that
    give living matter its ability to grow and multiply and arrange all the other
    necessities of life. Perhaps, as a scientific layman, he might develop an urge
    to attribute this patient ingenious scholarly tinkering with the ability to one
    day produce, by artificial means, a living cell in the test tube; but for many
    reasons, amongst which also belonged a respect for life, he could not resolve
    to deal so frivolously with this mystery. That is why he created a new kind of
    matter by chemical synthesis, one which simply behaves a lot like the living;
    it is an organic substance, different from that from which living cells are made;
    it is something like another alternative to life, a material substrate in which
    life could have evolved if it had not, from the beginning, taken a different path.
    We do not have to suppose that all the different possibilities of creation have
    been exhausted on our planet. The author of the robots would regard it as an act
    of scientific bad taste if he had brought something to life with brass cogwheels
    or created life in the test tube; the way he imagined it, he created only a new
    foundation for life, which began to behave like living matter, and which could
    therefore have become a vehicle of life—but a life which remains an unimaginable
    and incomprehensible mystery. This life will reach its fulfillment only when (with
    the aid of considerable inaccuracy and mysticism) the robots acquire souls. From
    which it is evident that the author did not invent his robots with the technological
    hubris of a mechanical engineer, but with the metaphysical humility of a spiritualist.'

    humbug over the robots. The author did not intend to furnish the world with plate
    metal dummies stuffed with cogwheels, photocells, and other mechanical gizmos.
    It appears, however, that the modern world is not interested in his scientific
    robots and has replaced them with technological ones; and these are, as is apparent,
    the true flesh-of-our-flesh of our age. The world needed mechanical robots, for
    it believes in machines more than it believes in life; it is fascinated more by
    the marvels of technology than by the miracle of life. For which reason, the author
    who wanted—through his insurgent robots, striving for a soul—to protest against
    the mechanical superstition of our times, must in the end claim something which
    nobody can deny him: the honor that he was defeated.'
