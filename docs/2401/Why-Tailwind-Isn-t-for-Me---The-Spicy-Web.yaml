    immediate pushback from die-hard Tailwind fans who accuse me (in so many words)

    this head on when he begs us to ‚Äúsuppress the urge to retch long enough to give
    it a chance‚Ä¶‚Äù. This is a tacit admission that writing markup this way initially

    without Tailwind, it‚Äôs typically a bundled compilation of dozens if not hundreds

    files like we do). It‚Äôs not something you can count on for source code.
  prefs:

    `display: flex`.'

    on projects on a regular basis. But believe me, I have done this! I‚Äôm on a client
    project right now where we‚Äôre migrating from Foundation to Bulma. While it‚Äôs true
    that it requires updating a bunch of HTML and some of the stylesheets in use,
    rest assured any custom bits of styling we wrote before will work again without
    hassle, because when you write plain ol‚Äô CSS (or even Sass), it just works no
    matter what.

    crutch. For example, I like the way Tailwind makes writing styles using CSS Grid
    techniques pretty straightforward. Unfortunately, after having done so, I still
    don‚Äôt really understand Grid syntax itself. I remain ignorant of the open CSS
    standard.

    CSS Custom Properties. You can define design tokens once at the `:root` level
    as variables, and utilize them **everywhere**. You can even modify them in real-time
    while the site is loaded, or overload them in particular parts of the DOM tree.
    And they work *great* with web components. More on that in a moment.

    you want. As in literally anywhere: a stylesheet, or a JS component, *or even

    where global theming and component styling via the Shadow DOM (and exposed Parts)
    all work together. Again, you can do all this based on technology that‚Äôs built-in
    and native to all modern browsers. And before you shrug your shoulders and go
    back to your React or your Vue, bear in mind that web components are not only
    an integral part of the HTML/CSS/JS spec today but are increasingly at the heart

    I have become convinced by now that using `<div>` and `<span>` tags everywhere
    in your markup is an anti-pattern. We live in a world where custom elements (aka

    There‚Äôs virtually no reason you‚Äôre forced to write `<div class="card"></div>`
