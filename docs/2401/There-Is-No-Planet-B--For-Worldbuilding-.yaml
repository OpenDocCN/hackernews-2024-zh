    Hobbit*) are set, there are what, six or seven identifiable countries? Most of
    the land is *terra nullius*, land that belongs to nobody, which in the real world
    occurs basically only in Antarctica and [that weird trapezoid of desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Tawil)
    between Egypt and Sudan. A lot of Middle-earth’s population seems to be living
    in random towns scattered throughout that *terra nullius*, with barely any roads
    or any sort of economic network between them. Long-distance communication apparently
    consists entirely of people riding horses occasionally (I can understand why Saruman
    gave in and started using his evil Palantir stone to overcome this limitation).
    The small town of Bree in the north is canonically said to be, together with a
    few adjacent villages, the only human settlement in all of Eriador — suggesting
    a density of population comparable to Greenland. In fact the population of the
    entire subcontinent — counting humans, hobbits, elves, dwarves and orcs — has
    been estimated to anywhere [between 2 and 7 million](https://medium.com/@lymanstone/how-many-hobbits-a-demographic-analysis-of-middle-earth-cd53b91d141f),
    i.e. a small modern country, or a middle-sized medieval one (Europe in the year
    1000 [had about 55-60 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_demography#Demographic_tables_of_Europe%E2%80%99s_population),

    small population means little of everything: little culture, little commerce,
    little diplomacy and politics, little complexity of any kind.'

    came up with a deep, coherent mythology! He wrote all this backstory in *The Silmarillion*

    *the movies*)! And also, after his death, his son continued his work, such that

    ideas, and escaping to cool imaginary places. Fictional worlds are cool! But I
    don’t think I’m wrong to claim that fictional worlds are cooler when the more
    intricate they are. We yearn for believable world that at least *feel* realistic
    even if they aren’t.

    evolution is, it allows us to use our brains to create really cool stuff. But
    evolution through selection has time on its side, and so far every really complex
    system known to man — including biological systems like the human body, and cultural
    ones like human civilization — has been the product of evolution rather than intelligent
    design.'

    it was more interesting to write stories set in our good, old, complicated Earth

    to construct an imaginary version that will always fall short of the ideal.

    and let evolution shape them, which it will surely do in all sorts of unforeseen
    ways. We’d need to have a thousand new civilizations bloom around distant stars,
    all creating their own fascinating stories in real time.
