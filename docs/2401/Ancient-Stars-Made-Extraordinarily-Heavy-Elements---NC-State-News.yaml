- en: How heavy can an element be? An international team of researchers has found
    that ancient stars were capable of producing elements with atomic masses greater
    than 260, heavier than any element on the periodic table found naturally on Earth.
    The finding deepens our understanding of element formation in stars.

    constantly fuse or break apart to create other lighter or heavier elements. When
    we refer to light or heavy elements, we’re talking about their atomic mass. Broadly
    speaking, atomic mass is based on the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus
    of one atom of that element.

- en: The heaviest elements are only known to be created in neutron stars via the
    rapid neutron capture process, or r-process. Picture a single atomic nucleus floating
    in a soup of neutrons. Suddenly, a bunch of those neutrons get stuck to the nucleus
    in a very short time period – usually in less than one second – then undergo some
    internal neutron-to-proton changes, and voila! A heavy element, such as gold,
    platinum or uranium, forms.

    One way that they do this is by splitting, a process called fission.

    say, lead and bismuth,” says Ian Roederer, associate professor of physics at North
    Carolina State University and lead author of the research. Roederer was previously
    at the University of Michigan.

    a lot of energy and a lot of neutrons to do so,” Roederer says. “And the best
    place to find both are at the birth or death of a neutron star, or when neutron
    stars collide and produce the raw ingredients for the process.

    process are quite extreme,” Roederer says. “We don’t have a good sense of how
    many different kinds of sites in the universe can generate the r-process, we don’t
    know how the r-process ends, and we can’t answer questions like, how many neutrons
    can you add? Or, how heavy can an element be? So we decided to look at elements
    that could be made by fission in some well-studied old stars to see if we could
    start to answer some of these questions.”

    stars in the Milky Way. The stars were known to have heavy elements formed by
    the r-process in earlier generations of stars. By taking a broader view of the
    amounts of each heavy element found in these stars collectively, rather than individually
    as is more common, they identified previously unrecognized patterns.

- en: Those patterns signaled that some elements listed near the middle of the periodic
    table – such as silver and rhodium – were likely the remnants of heavy element
    fission. The team was able to determine that the r-process can produce atoms with
    an atomic mass of at least 260 before they fission.

- en: “That 260 is interesting because we haven’t previously detected anything that
    heavy in space or naturally on Earth, even in nuclear weapon tests,” Roederer
    says. “But seeing them in space gives us guidance for how to think about models
    and fission – and could give us insight into how the rich diversity of elements
    came to be.”

- en: The heaviest chemical elements are naturally produced by the rapid neutron-capture
    process (r-process) during neutron star mergers or supernovae. The r-process production
    of elements heavier than uranium (transuranic nuclei) is poorly understood and
    inaccessible to experiments so must be extrapolated by using nucleosynthesis models.
    We examined element abundances in a sample of stars that are enhanced in r-process
    elements. The abundances of elements ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and silver
    (atomic numbers Z = 44 to 47; mass numbers A = 99 to 110) correlate with those
    of heavier elements (63 ≤ Z ≤ 78, A > 150). There is no correlation for neighboring
    elements (34 ≤ Z ≤ 42 and 48 ≤ Z ≤ 62). We interpret this as evidence that fission
    fragments of transuranic nuclei contribute to the abundances. Our results indicate
    that neutron-rich nuclei with mass numbers >260 are produced in r-process events.
