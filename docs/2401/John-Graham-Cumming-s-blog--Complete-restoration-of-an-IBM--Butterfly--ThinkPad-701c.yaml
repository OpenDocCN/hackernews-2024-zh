    on Hacker News about the IBM ThinkPad 701c (the one with the lovely folding "butterfly"
    keyboard). In particular, it was a discussion about the incredible web site [701c.org](http://701c.org)
    which gives very, very detailed instructions on how to dismantle, restore and
    preserve those lovely machines.

    do it myself for the last 10 years it so but realistically know I won’t. I’m based
    in NL.*" And I figured, he''s not too far from me, maybe I could get them and
    create one restored machine from them.'

    cases, screws are missing, parts are warped, covers are missing, the rubberized
    paint has become a sticky mess. But at least one of the keyboards seems to be
    OK (but see above about the ribbon cable!).

    a slow and delicate operation. Here are some internal pictures during that process.

    mess. Via a very slow process of using 90% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and a sharp

    able to verify that all the connections were good and there were no shorts.

    stickers on parts. Throughout the photos you'll see little red and green stickers
