    on Hacker News about the IBM ThinkPad 701c (the one with the lovely folding "butterfly"
    keyboard). In particular, it was a discussion about the incredible web site [701c.org](http://701c.org)
    which gives very, very detailed instructions on how to dismantle, restore and
    preserve those lovely machines.

    IBM ThinkPad 701c（带有可爱的折叠“蝴蝶”键盘）。特别是，讨论了令人难以置信的网站[701c.org](http://701c.org)，该网站提供了非常非常详细的说明，说明了如何拆解、恢复和保存这些可爱的机器。
