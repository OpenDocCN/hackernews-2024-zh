    a pawpaw one morning last week, it was already too late: The weird green fruit
    had sold out within an hour. “You have to get here early,” Jeff Rowe of Orchard
    Hill Organics, the market’s lone pawpaw vendor, told me. The day before, I had
    struck out in Manhattan’s expansive Union Square Greenmarket, where a seller told
    me pawpaws were extremely rare. The most upscale grocery stores—the kind that
    sell black garlic and cotton-candy grapes—also had none to offer.'

    it is. Bartenders mix [rum-and-pawpaw cocktails](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4AR9-pgBl-/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D).
    At pawpaw [festivals](https://ohiopawpawfest.com/vendors/) across the country,
    chefs whip up dishes such as pawpaw chicken wraps and pawpaw curry puffs. The
    pawpaw is having a moment, perhaps because it is a mass of contradictions: Its
    custardy flesh, ranging in color from butter yellow to sunset orange, tastes like
    a mix of banana, mango, and pineapple (or so I’d heard). But unlike those fruits,
    pawpaws are not native to the tropics; instead, the fruit grows across the Eastern
    United States and up into Canada. Pawpaw trees thrive along creeks and rivers,
    and there’s a good chance you’ve passed one without even knowing it.'

    it’s not easy to try a pawpaw for yourself. During the short window between August
    and early October when pawpaws are in season, foragers hunt down pawpaw patches
    and a few farmers’ markets put them up for sale. But because of the challenges
    in growing and shipping the fruit, they’re just about impossible to find in supermarkets.
    Miraculously, a friend who was part of a food co-op tracked three down. They were
    the size of dinner rolls, with smooth, green skin that had already begun to brown
    and collapse beneath our fingers from over-ripeness. They resembled ugly mangoes,
    or maybe Baby Yoda. I swaddled one in a puffer vest and guarded it with my life.

    even in spite of the interest in it. But its conspicuous absence from grocery
    stores feels a bit strange compared with our standards: Americans have come to
    expect even highly seasonal produce, even in the dead of winter, in part because
    a mind-bending amount of science and technology goes into making that happen.
    Indeed, American agriculture has a strong track record of making once-obscure
    plants go mainstream. Avocados, a little-known California crop for most of the
    20th century, are [ubiquitous in stores](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/the-selling-of-the-avocado/385047/)

    or [cherries](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/cherry-tree-myth),

    and supplemented the [meager diets of enslaved Africans](https://daily.jstor.org/plant-of-the-month-the-pawpaw/).
    At least six states have towns named after the pawpaw. But starting in the 1900s,
    the fruit faded from view as industrial farming took over. Its homely looks may
    also be to blame: A 1912 *New York Times* [article](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/11/19/107082272.html?pageNumber=98)
    claimed that a woman could not eat a pawpaw in front of her lover because “the
    sight is disgusting to the point of utter disillusion.” In rural communities,
    some people continued foraging for pawpaws, leading to the nicknames “hillbilly
    banana” and “poor man’s banana.” But in recent years, as Americans have started
    to embrace local food and [foraging](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/14/wild-garlic-nettles-and-berries-how-foraging-went-mainstream)
    has become a movement itself, the pawpaw has boomed. Today, wild pawpaws cannot
    seem to sustain the demand for the fruit: Rowe, the farmers’-market vendor, said
    he’s constantly selling out of pawpaws.'

    The apple from your grocery store might have been [picked up to a year ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/office-return-apple/619131/),
    but the pawpaw resists attempts to be eaten in anything but its freshest state.
    Once plucked, it must be consumed within [three to five days](https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/pawpaw/),
    if stored at room temperature. Dallying inevitably results in a wet, brown mass
    of mush, a transformation hastened by the tenderness of the fruit’s skin. Such
    fragility stands little chance against a truck ride across the country or the
    rigors of a Whole Foods produce display. “You have to get it and eat it or do
    something with it, otherwise it’s gone,” Chris Chmiel, the owner of Integration
    Acres in Ohio, one of the world’s biggest pawpaw processors, told me.

    cycle, which means growers must gently caress each one to gauge its softness and
    willingness to release from the branch—no small task when each fruit on a tree
    matures at different times. Many commercially grown fruits, including [apples,
    grapes, and strawberries](https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291645/farmers-cant-find-enough-workers-to-harvest-crops-and-fruits-and-vegetables-are-literally-rotting-in-fields/),
    are affordable because they are handpicked in sprawling fields by low-wage workers
    at a breakneck pace. Because the pawpaws you can buy at farmers’ markets are usually
    foraged or hand-harvested in small orchards, then packed and transported quickly,
    they come with a pretty hefty cost: Prices generally range from [$3 to $8 a pound](https://www.hobbyfarms.com/pawpaw-hot-new-fruit-with-old-history/#:~:text=The%20Price%20of%20a%20Pawpaw,%246%20a%20pound%20or%20more.).'

    to get blueberries was to forage for them in the woods. “People tried really hard
    to grow them out from seed, but it’s super hard,” Anya Osatuke, a Cornell University
    fruit-production specialist who works with pawpaw growers in New York, told me.
    In 1916, agriculturalists [ranked pawpaws over blueberries](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/now-when-you-pick-a-pawpaw-or-a-prickly-pear/583774/)
    as the American fruit most likely to succeed. Eventually, farmers discovered that
    blueberries thrived when they dug entire bushes out from the forest and planted
    them in full sun. Decades of selective breeding for better berries ensued, together
    with the development of ultraefficient packing methods and mechanical harvesters.
    Now blueberries are the [second-most-produced berry](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/blueberries-around-globe-past-present-and-future)
    in the United States after strawberries.

    similarly dedicated breeding efforts. To a certain degree, that *is* happening.
    At Kentucky State University, researchers at the world’s only full-time pawpaw-research
    program have worked since the 1990s to develop a better, more commercially viable
    fruit: one that is firm and tasty, with thick skin that changes color when ripe.
    So far, the program has bred and released three new varieties. The most recent
    one, the Chapell, has a reputation as the most vigorous and fast-growing pawpaw
    tree and produces creamy fruit with especially strong notes of banana and pineapple.'

    cross individual trees—say, one with pineapple-forward fruit and another with
    a tougher skin that is better suited to shipping. Growing a fruit-producing tree
    from a seed takes around eight years, and propagating more trees from the new
    plant takes another four. Factor in more time to run replicated-variety trials
    and collect several years’ worth of data and the process can take as long as 15
    years, Sheri Crabtree, a pawpaw expert at Kentucky State, told me.

    to getting something that’s dramatically better at shipping and storing,” Crabtree
    said. Unlike so-called climacteric fruits such as oranges and grapes, pawpaws
    continue to ripen once they’re picked. They both release and respond to a hormone
    called ethylene, whose levels increase during ripening. But not all fruit in this
    category is doomed to become goo like the pawpaw: Green bananas, once picked,
    stay unripe until deliberately exposed to ethylene during storage, ensuring that
    markets receive perfectly yellow bunches. Pawpaws are less accommodating. “To
    my knowledge, no one has ever been able to pick a pawpaw that didn’t just naturally
    ripen on its own accord,” Rob Brannan, a food scientist at Ohio University, told
    me.'

    oxidase, the same enzyme that gives cut apples and avocados their muddy color.
    The enzyme can be deactivated by heat or extremely high pressure, which is why
    supermarket guacamole stays bright green, he said. But the technique didn’t work
    on pawpaws. “We did the same thing, and it doesn’t inactivate the enzyme,” Brannan
    said.

    the pawpaw’s challenges had proven insurmountable with other produce, the American
    diet would look very different. Bright-red tomatoes are available in the dead
    of winter thanks to tightly controlled greenhouses that operate around the clock.
    Some Gala apples are [imported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/dining/fruit-vegetables-imports.html)
    all the way from New Zealand. Eventually, the pawpaw could get there too. “I’m
    sure if someone puts their mind to it, they could do it,” Osatuke said.

    in-demand enough to lead to money for widespread research that would deliver the
    next generation of pawpaws. With enough time and money, commercial harvests could
    reach a point where shipping pawpaws would actually be realistic. The National
    Institute of Food and Agriculture funds development of new plant varieties, but
    “there has to be an economic argument” for doing so, Brannan said. What the fruit
    needs is a patron, he added, much like the [pair of Beverly Hills billionaires](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/dining/pomegranates-for-one-and-all.html)
    who kick-started the modern American pomegranate industry in the early 2000s by
    planting 6,000 acres of trees in California. Barring that, enthusiasts will have

    of the fruit, or harvest and freeze the pulp to store it long-term. Processed
    pawpaw products—ice cream, baked goods, dessert wines, sour beers—may be the fruit’s
    best shot at commercial success. Integration Acres, which Chmiel founded in the
    ’90s after observing the abundance of wasted pawpaws under Ohio’s native trees,
    churns out frozen pulp, jams, and vinaigrettes. “When you have lemons, you make
    lemonade. When you have a lot of pawpaws, you make pawpaw pulp,” he said. In 1999,
    he founded the Ohio Pawpaw Festival, which draws as many as [10,000 attendees](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/pawpaws-are-americas-hidden-edible-treasure-heres-how-to-pick-them)

    Even if it was possible to scale production and ship the fruit nationwide, doing
    so would be at odds with the urge for local, sustainable food that fueled the
    pawpaw boom in the first place. Planting huge pawpaw orchards might just add to
    the ecological toll of mass farming. Breeders could use genetic modification to
    improve the fruit, Brannan said, but “that’s 180 degrees from what people think
    of the pawpaw. The pawpaw is real, natural, authentic, and local.” For all the
    weird, frustrating aspects of pawpaws, they are a reminder of just how far food
    science has come in a century-plus.

    moss. Slicing it open, I spooned the flesh into my mouth and began to understand
    the fascination: With a scent like banana bread and a pleasant, persimmon-like
    sweetness, it was different from any American fruit I had ever tasted. Rather,
    it surfaced a childhood memory from the Philippines of eating *atis*, a relative
    of the pawpaw known in English as a sweetsop or sugar apple. What was more intriguing
    than the pawpaw’s flavor was the novelty of being whisked away to the tropics
    by a wild American fruit that I had hunted down for a week. Would it have been
    as good if I’d bought it from a stack at Trader Joe’s?'
