- en: It’s oh-so-easy to be absolutely mesmerized by these spiral galaxies. Follow
    their clearly defined arms, which are brimming with stars, to their centers, where
    there may be old star clusters and – sometimes – active supermassive black holes.
    Only NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope can deliver highly detailed scenes of nearby
    galaxies in a combination of [near- and mid-infrared light](https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy)
    – and a set of these images was publicly released today.

- en: These Webb images are part of a large, long-standing project, the Physics at
    High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) program, which is supported
    by more than 150 astronomers worldwide. Before Webb took these images, PHANGS
    was already brimming with data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the European
    Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer,
    and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, including observations in
    ultraviolet, visible, and radio light. Webb’s near- and mid-infrared contributions
    have provided several new puzzle pieces.

    for strategic initiatives at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
    “They’re mind-blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies
    for decades. Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever
    observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.”

    “I feel like our team lives in a constant state of being overwhelmed – in a positive
    way – by the amount of detail in these images,” added Thomas Williams, a postdoctoral
    researcher at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.

    (Near-Infrared Camera) captured millions of stars in these images, which sparkle
    in blue tones. Some stars are spread throughout the spiral arms, but others are
    clumped tightly together in star clusters.

    (Mid-Infrared Instrument) data highlights glowing dust, showing us where it exists
    around and between stars. It also spotlights stars that haven’t yet fully formed
    – they are still encased in the gas and dust that feed their growth, like bright
    red seeds at the tips of dusty peaks. “These are where we can find the newest,
    most massive stars in the galaxies,” said Erik Rosolowsky, a professor of physics
    at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

- en: Something else that amazed astronomers? Webb’s images show large, spherical
    shells in the gas and dust. “These holes may have been created by one or more
    stars that exploded, carving out giant holes in the [interstellar material](https://webbtelescope.org/glossary.html#h3-CK-5e7e2388-0eae-4a31-96f7-ad1f8419c9eb),”
    explained Adam Leroy, a professor of astronomy at the Ohio State University in
    Columbus.

    orange. “These structures tend to follow the same pattern in certain parts of
    the galaxies,” Rosolowsky added. “We think of these like waves, and their spacing
    tells us a lot about how a galaxy distributes its gas and dust.” Study of these
    structures will provide key insights about how galaxies build, maintain, and shut
    off star formation.

    galaxies’ cores and spreads along their arms, spiraling away from the center.
    The farther a star is from the galaxy’s core, the more likely it is to be younger.
    In contrast, the areas near the cores that look lit by a blue spotlight are populations
    of older stars.

    a clear sign that there may be an active supermassive black hole,” said Eva Schinnerer,
    a staff scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.
    “Or, the star clusters toward the center are so bright that they have saturated
    that area of the image.”

- en: There are many avenues of research that scientists can begin to pursue with
    the combined PHANGS data, but the unprecedented number of stars Webb resolved
    are a great place to begin. “Stars can live for billions or trillions of years,”
    Leroy said. “By precisely cataloging all types of stars, we can build a more reliable,
    holistic view of their life cycles.”

- en: In addition to immediately releasing these images, the PHANGS team has also
    released the largest catalog to date of roughly 100,000 star clusters. “The amount
    of analysis that can be done with these images is vastly larger than anything
    our team could possibly handle,” Rosolowsky emphasized. “We’re excited to support
    the community so all researchers can contribute.”
