- en: '“They are so beautiful, so magnificent, those deathly solitudes, so strange
    in their fleeting finery of brilliant colors, that they always leave one with
    a burning desire to see them again”, Charles Rabot [wrote](https://www.google.es/books/edition/A_travers_la_Russie_bor%C3%A9ale/gx4EAAAAYAAJ?hl=es&gbpv=1&dq=A+travers+la+Russie+bor%C3%A9ale&printsec=frontcover)
    in 1894 of the particular allure of boreal landscapes. Hardly had he returned
    from a trip to Greenland, as he put it in the preface to his travelogue of the
    Russian taiga, when “nostalgia for the countries of the north took me” and sent
    him off on another of the peregrinations that would mark his life. The opening
    of that book includes a portrait of the author that, while showing nothing of
    his physical appearance, captures the image of the intrepid explorer that he wished
    to convey to the world: knee-high leather boots, matching gloves, and face entirely
    obscured by a thick swaddling of mosquito netting to prevent him from being eaten
    alive by gnats.'
