- en: Count Spotify among those not thrilled with how [Apple has chosen to comply](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which sets the stage for sideloading
    apps, alternative app stores, browser choice, and more. On Friday, the streaming
    music company issued its response to Apple’s new DMA rules, calling the new fees
    imposed on developers “extortion” and Apple’s compliance plan “a complete and
    total farce,” that demonstrated the tech giant believes that the rules don’t apply
    to them.

- en: Apple earlier this week announced a [host of changes](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/apple-dma-changes/)
    that comply with the letter of the EU law, if not the spirit. The company said
    that app developers in the EU will receive reduced commissions, but it also introduced
    a new “[core technology fee](https://www.apple.com/cm/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/#:~:text=Core%20Technology%20Fee%20%E2%80%94%20iOS%20apps,over%20a%201%20million%20threshold.)”
    that requires developers to pay €0.50 for each first annual install per year over
    a 1 million threshold, regardless of their distribution channel. It will also
    charge a 3% payment processing fee when developers use Apple’s in-app payments
    instead of their own.

- en: In a company blog post and a series of [posts on X (formerly Twitter),](https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988499518362089?s=20)
    Spotify CEO Daniel Ek shared his thoughts on Apple’s DMA announcement, after a
    review by Spotify’s lawyers. He begins by calling the announcement “at best vague
    and misleading” and a “new low for the company.”

- en: Ek says Apple’s solution is a “masterclass in distortion” as it presents app
    developers with a choice of sticking to the current terms or having to switch
    to a “convoluted new model” that initially may look attractive, but actually may
    come with higher fees. He points out that any app with tens or hundreds of millions
    of EU users would now face a new tax on every new download and update annually
    — something that would impact a number of larger apps like WhatsApp, Duolingo,
    X, and Pinterest, as well as Spotify’s own.

- en: The system is clearly designed to keep apps from opting for alternative means
    of distribution like sideloading or alternative app stores. However, without the
    big apps available through these alternative channels, they’ll lose their appeal
    to consumers. Apple’s App Store will maintain its power, Ek believes.

    explains — it’s forced to stick with the current system.

    install base in the 100 million range, this new tax on downloads and updates could
    skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold.
    This as we have to pay on every install or update to our free or paid app, even
    for those who no longer use the service. So where does that leave us? Under the
    new terms, we cannot afford these fees if we want to be a profitable company,
    so our only option is to stick with the status quo. The very thing we’ve been
    fighting against for five years,” Ek says.

    Apple is doing and stands firm, and “doesn’t let their work over the years all

    Fairness (CAF)](https://appfairness.org/), a lobbying group whose members include
    Epic, Spotify, Tile, Basecamp, Match, Deezer, and dozens of smaller developers.
    The [organization on Thursday declared](https://appfairness.org/caf-statement-on-apples-dma-non-compliance-plan/)
    that Apple’s new fees on direct downloads and payments they do nothing to process
    violate the law, and does not actually increase either competition or fairness
    in the digital market.

    illegal options,” Rick VanMeter, Executive Director of CAF said, in a statement.
    “Either stick with the terrible status quo or opt into a new convoluted set of
    terms that are bad for developers and consumers alike. This is yet another attempt
    to circumvent regulation, the likes of which we’ve seen in the United States,
    the Netherlands, and South Korea. Apple’s ‘plan’ is a shameless insult to the
    European Commission and the millions of European consumers they represent – it
    must not stand and should be rejected by the Commission.”

    for apps in the European Union give developers choice — with new options to distribute
    iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same
