&#124; **Closing down playstation2-linux.com**  [Linux for PlayStation 2 Community](https://web.archive.org/web/20100524023205/http://playstation2-linux.com/projects/ps2linux/) - *sarahe - 2009-Jun-04 03:49*
After 7 years of service, the time has come when we must plan for closing down this site. We appreciate there are some valuable downloads and postings here, and we're looking at continuing to provide an archive of those for you once the site is gone - please let us know what you'd vote for putting in there.

SPS2? VCL? Let us know! We have a few months left to go, but by the end of October 2009 we will be looking at closing down the site as it stands now.

Thanks to all the enthusiastic members of the PS2Linux community!

Sarah.

**The Future of Mozilla for the PlayStation2**
 [Mozilla for PlayStation2](https://web.archive.org/web/20100524023205/http://playstation2-linux.com/projects/mozilla-ps2/) - *ppietro - 2007-Nov-09 04:09*
Hi everyone,

I could have sworn that I updated the News section a few months ago... but even if I did, it's gone now.

"So - what's going on with Mozilla for the PS2?" you might be wondering.

Well - I'm kind of spinning the project down. There's a couple of reasons.

The main reason is that Firefox 2.0's memory footprint seems to be larger than Firefox 1.5\. What this means is that the performance of Firefox 2.0 suffers on the PS2 compared to Firefox 1.5.

Unfortunately, the Firefox team has officially halted development on Firefox 1.5 with build 1.5.0.12, so there won't be any more updates to that build tree. I'll continue to build Firefox 2.0 when I get time, but the performance hit may make it less desireable than 1.5.

A group of the long-time #sps2 irc channel users met up at the SCEE DevStation developer event in London last night. Hello to sparky, bjt, kazan, jbit and nervus, it's great to see developers from Linux on PS2 going pro :)
