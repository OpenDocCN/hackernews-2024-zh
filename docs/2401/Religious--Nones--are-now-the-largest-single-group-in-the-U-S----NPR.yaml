    from Pew Research finds that the religiously unaffiliated – a group comprised
    of atheists, agnostic and those who say their religion is "nothing in particular"
    – is now the largest cohort in the U.S. They're more prevalent among American
    adults than Catholics (23%) or evangelical Protestants (24%).

    many also think it does some good. Most have more positive views of science than
    those who are religiously affiliated; however, they reject the idea that science
    can explain everything.

    who identify with a religion – they're less likely to vote. So, while they identify
    as Democrats, getting them to the polls on election day may prove to be a challenge.

    and civically engaged, whereas those who responded that their religion is 'nothing
    in particular' are far less likely to vote.

    of religious leaders to make moral decisions, Pew found that Nones say they're

    into the data shows that men are significantly more likely to say they're atheist
    or agnostic whereas women are more likely to describe their religion as 'nothing
