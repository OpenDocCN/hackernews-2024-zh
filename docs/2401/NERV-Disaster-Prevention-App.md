# NERV Disaster Prevention App

> 来源：[https://nerv.app/en/](https://nerv.app/en/)

The NERV Disaster Prevention App is a smartphone service that delivers earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption and emergency warnings, as well as provides weather-related disaster prevention information for flooding and landslides, optimised based on the user's current and registered locations. It was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions.

With information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan.

※3 Gehirn Inc. is first and foremost an information security company. The security and privacy of our users is our highest priority. We take great care not to collect excessive amounts of information about our users through this application.

Acquired location and registered location information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information, and for sending push notifications. The location information that's sent from the app to the server is first converted to an area code. An area code is roughly equivalent to a zip code. Only that code is sent to the server, meaning the user's exact location is never sent to the server.

For example, if you were located in "Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo", it will be converted to a code that is used by everyone in Chiyoda-ku, so no one will ever be able to trace your exact location back to you. Additionally, the server doesn't store past area codes, so your movements cannot be tracked.

All data sent over the internet is first encrypted, and all data stored in the server's database is encrypted before being stored. If you ever set your location permissions to "Do Not Allow" or "Allow Only While Using", the registration information will be deleted from the server. Additionally, if the user ever uninstalls the app, the registration information will automatically be deleted from the server roughly one month after the app last tried to communicate with the server.

※4\. In order to receive notifications about disasters related to your current location; [iOS] Set Location permissions to "Always Allow" and enable "Background App Refresh". [Android] Set Location permissions to "Always Allow".

When you set the app's location permissions to "Always Allow", the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This doesn't happen often, so the battery usage impact is negligible. Additionally, if "Low Power Mode" is enabled, the app will not update your location in the background in order to save power.
