- en: The Immortel family of serif typefaces comprises four variants (Infra, Colera,
    Vena, and Acedia), all designed with multiplexed set widths to be interchangeable
    without causing text to reflow. The Infra and Vena variants – [inspired](https://cltn.fr/texts/immortel)
    by Robert Granjon and Jacques-François Rosart, respectively – are intended for
    use in running body text. They include “Median” italics for longer blocks of text,
    as well as more exaggerated italics for stronger emphasis. They both also offer
    a variable grade axis for slight weight adjustments, to accommodate different
    typographic environments and user preferences.
