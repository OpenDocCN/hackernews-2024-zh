- en: Civil liberties advocates have long argued that “geofence” search warrants are
    unconstitutional for their ability to ensnare entirely innocent people who were
    nearby at the time a crime was committed. But errors in the geofence warrant applications
    that go before a judge can violate the privacy of vastly more people — in one
    case almost two miles away.

- en: Attorneys at the ACLU of Northern California found what they called an “alarming
    error” in a geofence warrant application that “resulted in a warrant stretching
    nearly two miles across San Francisco.” The error, likely caused by a typo, allowed
    the requesting law enforcement agency to capture information on anyone who entered
    the stretch of San Francisco erroneously marked on the search warrant.

    geofence warrant, or for how long the warrant was in effect. The attorneys questioned
    how many other geofence warrant application mistakes had slipped through and resulted
    in the return of vastly more data in error.

    agencies to seek a court order requesting data from tech companies that store
    vast amounts of location data on its users, like Google, to [demand information
    on which devices were in a particular geographic area](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/)
    at a certain point in time, such as when and where a crime was carried out. Google
    revealed in 2021 that [geofence warrants made up about one-quarter of all U.S.
    legal demands it received](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/google-geofence-warrants/)
    in the space of a few years.

- en: The ACLU attorneys reviewed thousands of geofence warrants filed in San Francisco
    Criminal Court that were issued over three years between 2018 and mid-2021, which
    they say was likely only a fraction of geofence warrants used in San Francisco
    during that time. The attorneys warned that the reach of geofence warrants when
    surveilling in busy urban areas — San Francisco is one of the most densely populated
    U.S. cities — often include homes and apartment buildings, busy thoroughfares
    and places of worship.

- en: The attorneys said they also found a geofence warrant that included four places
    of worship over a couple of streets in San Francisco’s Bret Harte neighborhood,
    allowing police to determine “where you were and who you were with” during the
    time that the warrant was in effect.

    anyone who was in the Le Méridien hotel or three nearby banks despite having no
    connection to the alleged criminal sought in the warrant. A review of the area
    by TechCrunch shows the geofence area also includes the headquarters of software
    giant Oracle and several busy pubs and restaurants.

    Street — with no connection at all to any criminal activity — your location information

    targeted certain San Francisco neighborhoods more than others, particularly immigrant-heavy

    forward](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/16/google-geofence-warrants-law-enforcement-privacy/)
    by forcing law enforcement agencies to seek the data directly from the device
    owners. Other tech companies that store troves of users’ location data — like
    Uber, Microsoft and Yahoo (which owns TechCrunch) — are known to receive geofence
    warrants.

    protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, with an eventual legal
