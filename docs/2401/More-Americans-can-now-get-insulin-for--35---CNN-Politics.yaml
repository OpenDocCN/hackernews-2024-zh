    is joining the nation’s two other major insulin manufacturers in offering either

    which is relatively inexpensive to produce. The inflation-adjusted cost of the
    medication has increased 24% between 2017 and 2022, and spending on insulin has
    tripled in the past decade to $22.3 billion in 2022, according to the American
    Diabetes Association.

    patients have been unable to afford their medicine, leading them to ration doses

    on insulin manufacturers to lower their prices. Eli Lilly and Sanofi announced
    that they would institute $35 caps shortly after President Joe Biden called on
    drugmakers to do so in his [State of the Union address](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/02/annotated-fact-checked-president-biden-sotu/)

    pharmacies. The uninsured are able to download the Lilly Insulin Value Program
    savings card, which allows them to get the medication for $35 a month.

    public pressure to increase affordability and because of new competitors, such
    as Civica Rx, said Tim Lash, president of West Health Policy Center, which focuses
    on lowering the cost of health care. [Civica Rx](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/politics/civica-insulin-affordable-drug/index.html)

    of dollars a year, experts said. That’s because the 2021 American Rescue Plan
    Act made a major change to the rebates that drug manufacturers pay annually to
    state Medicaid programs – a change that kicked in on January 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rebate is based on how much a drug’s list price has increased compared with
    inflation and how deeply it is discounted in the commercial market. Until now,
    that rebate was capped at 100% of the drug’s average manufacturer’s price, which
    is a proxy for its list price.

    the amount the drugmaker earns from Medicaid for the medication. About 15% to
    20% of brand drugs have reached the cap, according to IQVIA, an analytics and
    research company.

    to pay an additional $430 million in Medicaid rebates in 2024, said Spencer Perlman,
    director of health care research at Veda Partners, a consulting group that provides
    policy analysis to institutional investors. Plus, Eli Lilly could earn an additional
    $85 million in profits from Medicaid because of the way the rebate formula is
    designed.

    from a pricing perspective than they were 30 years ago when they were first launched,
