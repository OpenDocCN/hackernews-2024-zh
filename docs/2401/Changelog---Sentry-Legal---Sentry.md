# Changelog — Sentry Legal | Sentry

> 来源：[https://sentry.io/legal/changelog/](https://sentry.io/legal/changelog/)

We collect PII about people browsing our website, users of the Sentry service, prospective customers, and people who otherwise interact with us.

What if my PII is included in data sent to Sentry by a Sentry customer (e.g., someone using Sentry to monitor their app)? In this case you have to contact the Sentry customer (e.g., the maker of the app). We do not control the data that is sent to us through the Sentry service for the purposes of application monitoring.
