    this confidence ever since he read a 2014 study that reviewed the fate of 90,400
    type 2 diabetics taking either metformin or another medication. The metformin
    patients in the study not only outlived the diabetics taking the other drug—a
    not especially surprising result if metformin is a superior treatment—but also
    outlived the nondiabetics studied as a comparison.

  zh: 他对二甲双胍足够好的信心始于他阅读了一项2014年的研究，该研究回顾了90,400名2型糖尿病患者服用二甲双胍或其他药物的情况。该研究中的二甲双胍患者不仅比服用其他药物的糖尿病患者长寿——如果二甲双胍是一种优越的治疗方法，这并不是特别令人惊讶的结果——而且还比作为对照的非糖尿病患者长寿。
- en: In the end, the scientists holed up in the Spanish prison settled on an unusual
    clinical trial designed to test whether metformin can, in addition to extending
    life, delay the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment.
    The FDA will not make its decision on whether metformin becomes the US’s first
    antiaging drug until the study, dubbed [Targeting Aging with Metformin](https://www.afar.org/natgeo/)
    (TAME for short), is complete. That won’t happen for at least another five years.
    But, based on their June 2015 meeting with FDA officials, Barzilai and his colleagues
    are optimistic that the FDA is onboard. “Within five minutes, we were all in complete
    agreement that this is plausible” and “a good idea,” S. Jay Olshansky says.

  zh: 最终，被困在西班牙监狱的科学家们采取了一项不同寻常的临床试验，旨在测试二甲双胍是否能延长寿命的同时延缓癌症、心血管疾病和认知障碍的发生。美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）将在研究完成之后做出是否批准二甲双胍成为美国首个抗衰老药物的决定，该研究被称为[Targeting
    Aging with Metformin](https://www.afar.org/natgeo/)（简称 TAME）。这至少还需要五年的时间。但是，根据他们2015年6月与FDA官员的会议，巴兹拉伊和他的同事们对FDA的支持持乐观态度。“在五分钟内，我们就完全一致认为这是可行的”、“是一个好主意”，S·杰伊·奥尔沙斯基说。

    Vatican conference. So for the first two days he busied himself mingling with
    other conference attendees, often approaching them and lifting the IDs hanging
    from their necks up to his face so that he could make out their names. One night,
    he turned to an elderly woman in his hotel elevator and asked how old she was,
    something he often does out of professional interest. Regardless of what number
    these women offer up, Barzilai always tell them they are, in fact, biologically
    younger. When Barzilai and the woman got off on the same floor of the hotel, he
    took her hand and led her in a little dance. “My continuous mitzvah project is
    to dance with elderly women,” he tells me, using the Hebrew word for “good deed.”'

  zh: '**巴兹拉伊原本没有**被安排在梵蒂冈会议的第三和最后一天发言。所以在前两天，他忙着与其他与会者交流，经常走近他们，并把挂在他们脖子上的 ID 拿到他的脸上，以便看清他们的名字。有一天晚上，他转向了一个在他酒店电梯里的老妇人，并询问她多大年纪，这是他出于专业兴趣经常问的。无论这些妇女报出什么数字，巴兹拉伊总是告诉她们，事实上，她们在生物学上更年轻。当巴兹拉伊和这位妇人在酒店的同一楼层下电梯时，他牵着她的手，带她跳了一小段舞。“我的持续的米斯瓦（Mitzvah）项目是和年长的女性一起跳舞，”他告诉我，使用了希伯来语中的“善行”一词。'
- en: When it was finally his turn to address the conference, Barzilai began by pointing
    out that the likelihood of being diagnosed with a deadly chronic disease, such
    as cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s, increases dramatically as we age. The
    current approach of treating each illness separately, he suggested, ultimately
    amounts to a fool’s errand. We survive cancer only to get heart disease a few
    years later, or vice versa. “Unless we target aging itself,” he announced, “all
    we can hope is that we switch one disease for another.”

  zh: 当巴兹拉伊终于轮到他在会议上发言时，他首先指出，被诊断出患有致命的慢性疾病，如癌症、心脏病或阿尔茨海默病的可能性随着年龄增长而大大增加。他建议，目前的治疗方法是分别对待每种疾病，最终等同于徒劳的努力。我们只是在癌症后幸存下来，然后几年后得了心脏病，或者反之亦然。他宣布：“除非我们直接针对衰老本身，否则我们只能希望将一种疾病换成另一种。”
- en: 'If and when the FDA approves the first antiaging drug, Barzilai believes it
    will create a domino effect of health and economic benefits: Insurance companies
    will begin to cover antiaging drugs, and pharmaceutical companies, in turn, will
    begin investing more in antiaging research and produce new and better drugs that
    extend human health span. Whether all these benefits will come to pass is hard
    to know. Big Pharma’s hesitancy to dive into antiaging drugs may have as much
    to do with past failures as the FDA. In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline spent $720 million
    on a biotech company that many believed would develop antiaging drugs from resveratrol,
    a compound found in red-wine grapes. Five years later, after a series of failed
    trials, the company [killed the initiative](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arlene-weintraub/glaxos-halted-drug-trial-_b_792690.html).'

  zh: 如果以及当 FDA 批准第一种抗衰老药物时，巴兹拉伊相信这将带来一系列健康和经济利益的多米诺效应：保险公司将开始覆盖抗衰老药物，制药公司反过来将开始更多地投资抗衰老研究，并生产延长人类健康寿命的新药。所有这些好处是否会实现还很难说。大型制药公司对于抗衰老药物的犹豫可能与过去的失败一样多地与
    FDA 有关。2008 年，葛兰素史克公司花费了 7.2 亿美元收购了一家生物技术公司，许多人认为该公司将从红葡萄酒中发现的一种化合物白藜芦醇中开发出抗衰老药物。五年后，在一系列失败的试验之后，该公司[终止了这项计划](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arlene-weintraub/glaxos-halted-drug-trial-_b_792690.html)。
- en: Thus far, getting the FDA excited about TAME has proven to be less challenging
    than convincing someone to pay for the study. Because metformin is a generic,
    there is no pot of gold waiting for investors at the end of the process. The TAME
    trial, which will enroll approximately 3,000 men and women between the ages of
    65 and 79 at 14 centers across the country, is projected to cost $69 million.
    Barzilai is counting on the National Institutes of Health to cover a significant
    share of the cost, and he has been directly involved in lobbying the agency to
    back the study. (When he met with Mississippi senator Thad Cochran, he joked that
    Mississippians need a drug like metformin because they are victims of the state’s
    great food and can’t stop eating.)

  zh: 至今，让美国食品药品监督管理局（FDA）对 TAME 表现出兴奋的程度似乎比说服某人为研究买单更容易。因为二甲双胍是一种常见的药物，所以在这个过程的最后并没有等待投资者的一锅金。预计
    TAME 试验将在全国 14 个中心招募约 3000 名年龄介于 65 到 79 岁之间的男性和女性，估计花费将达到 6900 万美元。巴兹拉伊指望国立卫生研究院承担相当大一部分的费用，并且他直接参与游说该机构支持这项研究。（当他与密西西比州参议员萨德·科克兰会面时，他开玩笑说密西西比人需要一种像二甲双胍这样的药物，因为他们是该州美食的受害者，无法停止进食。）
- en: The rest of the money will need to come from private donations. Barzilai recently
    told me that a billionaire, who insists on remaining anonymous, is considering
    matching the NIH funding. But, for now, Barzilai still has little to show in the
    way of locked-down TAME funding beyond the money that he, his wife, and his in-laws
    have given to the American Federation for Aging Research, the organization sponsoring
    the trial. “Rich people are interested in aging,” he says. “They call me to prescribe
    metformin, but they don’t understand that I’m doing something that’s more profound.”

  zh: 其余资金需要来自私人捐赠。巴兹拉伊最近告诉我，一位坚持匿名的亿万富翁正在考虑匹配 NIH 的资金。但是，目前为止，除了他、他的妻子和他的岳父母捐给主办试验的美国老龄研究联合会的钱外，巴兹拉伊还没有确保
    TAME 资金的迹象。“有钱人对老龄化感兴趣，”他说。“他们给我打电话开处方给他们二甲双胍，但他们不明白我正在做的是更深刻的事情。”
