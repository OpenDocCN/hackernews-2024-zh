    this confidence ever since he read a 2014 study that reviewed the fate of 90,400
    type 2 diabetics taking either metformin or another medication. The metformin
    patients in the study not only outlived the diabetics taking the other drug—a
    not especially surprising result if metformin is a superior treatment—but also
    outlived the nondiabetics studied as a comparison.

    clinical trial designed to test whether metformin can, in addition to extending
    life, delay the onset of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment.
    The FDA will not make its decision on whether metformin becomes the US’s first
    antiaging drug until the study, dubbed [Targeting Aging with Metformin](https://www.afar.org/natgeo/)
    (TAME for short), is complete. That won’t happen for at least another five years.
    But, based on their June 2015 meeting with FDA officials, Barzilai and his colleagues
    are optimistic that the FDA is onboard. “Within five minutes, we were all in complete
    agreement that this is plausible” and “a good idea,” S. Jay Olshansky says.

    Vatican conference. So for the first two days he busied himself mingling with
    other conference attendees, often approaching them and lifting the IDs hanging
    from their necks up to his face so that he could make out their names. One night,
    he turned to an elderly woman in his hotel elevator and asked how old she was,
    something he often does out of professional interest. Regardless of what number
    these women offer up, Barzilai always tell them they are, in fact, biologically
    younger. When Barzilai and the woman got off on the same floor of the hotel, he
    took her hand and led her in a little dance. “My continuous mitzvah project is
    to dance with elderly women,” he tells me, using the Hebrew word for “good deed.”'

    out that the likelihood of being diagnosed with a deadly chronic disease, such
    as cancer, heart disease, or Alzheimer’s, increases dramatically as we age. The
    current approach of treating each illness separately, he suggested, ultimately
    amounts to a fool’s errand. We survive cancer only to get heart disease a few
    years later, or vice versa. “Unless we target aging itself,” he announced, “all
    we can hope is that we switch one disease for another.”

    will create a domino effect of health and economic benefits: Insurance companies
    will begin to cover antiaging drugs, and pharmaceutical companies, in turn, will
    begin investing more in antiaging research and produce new and better drugs that
    extend human health span. Whether all these benefits will come to pass is hard
    to know. Big Pharma’s hesitancy to dive into antiaging drugs may have as much
    to do with past failures as the FDA. In 2008, GlaxoSmithKline spent $720 million
    on a biotech company that many believed would develop antiaging drugs from resveratrol,
    a compound found in red-wine grapes. Five years later, after a series of failed
    trials, the company [killed the initiative](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arlene-weintraub/glaxos-halted-drug-trial-_b_792690.html).'

- en: Thus far, getting the FDA excited about TAME has proven to be less challenging
    than convincing someone to pay for the study. Because metformin is a generic,
    there is no pot of gold waiting for investors at the end of the process. The TAME
    trial, which will enroll approximately 3,000 men and women between the ages of
    65 and 79 at 14 centers across the country, is projected to cost $69 million.
    Barzilai is counting on the National Institutes of Health to cover a significant
    share of the cost, and he has been directly involved in lobbying the agency to
    back the study. (When he met with Mississippi senator Thad Cochran, he joked that
    Mississippians need a drug like metformin because they are victims of the state’s
    great food and can’t stop eating.)

    told me that a billionaire, who insists on remaining anonymous, is considering
    matching the NIH funding. But, for now, Barzilai still has little to show in the
    way of locked-down TAME funding beyond the money that he, his wife, and his in-laws
    have given to the American Federation for Aging Research, the organization sponsoring
    the trial. “Rich people are interested in aging,” he says. “They call me to prescribe
    metformin, but they don’t understand that I’m doing something that’s more profound.”
