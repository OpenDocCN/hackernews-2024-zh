    of the Hue system and can do this [control your bridge], is by physical access
    to the device — and pressing the button on the bridge,” says Yianni. “This approach
    is inadequate going forward, and we need a more robust way to identify the owner
    of the system and enable them to manage their system — the Hue account is how
    we will do this.”

    services need to be logged into and which not. It’s a god damn PDF reader, no

    they are all services and software that don’t **need** logins and accounts. They

    use these features.
