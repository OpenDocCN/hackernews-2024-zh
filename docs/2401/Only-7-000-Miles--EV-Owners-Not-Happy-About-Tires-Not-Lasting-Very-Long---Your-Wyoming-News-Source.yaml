- en: Automotive journalist Vince Bodiford, publisher of Cheyenne-based [TheWeekendDrive.com](http://TheWeekendDrive.com),
    said that the worn — or bald — tire issue with EVs could be caused by several
    factors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He pointed to an EV’s large battery system that weighs hundreds of pounds that
    puts more stress on the tires, as well as the car’s electrical motors that can
    produce peak power, or torque, almost instantaneously.
  prefs: []

- en: “It doesn’t surprise me that weight and torque stress wears tires out faster
    on EVs,” said Bodiford, who cited other possible factors as hot or cold climates
    and start-and-stop characteristics of traffic-congested city driving.

    on a tire,” he said. “That would be in a cold, snowy region of the Rocky Mountain
    states, like Wyoming, or desert places like super-hot Barstow or Needles in California.”
  prefs: []

- en: He also speculated that “regenerative breaking,” where tires work really hard
    to stop due to torque stress instead of friction braking in gas-powered cars,
    as another possible wearing effect on tires.

    a driver peels out, he said. Those tires have a shelf-life of roughly a mile-and-a-half
