# Inside The Design: The Case For Better Watch Typography - Hodinkee

It's more common for watchmakers' lettering to adapt an existing typeface. A. Lange & Söhne has made lettering a hallmark of its watches. For the august German watchmaker's 1994 relaunch, its designers [modified Engravers](https://andlarry.com/journal/watch-the-type), a late 19th-century font designed by Robert Wiebking, to the point of it being almost new. Similarly, the minimalist German brand NOMOS uses a semi-handmade approach with the majority of its timepieces. "There are always small design details that vary from model to model, so it would be inconsistent with our design ethos to just take a typeface off-the-rack," says Michael Paul, a product designer at the company.

NOMOS' [Club](https://nomos-glashuette.com/en/club/club-701) line, for example, uses [Interstate](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/2247/interstate), a friendly sans serif font inspired by the United States interstate system's signage. NOMOS' designers tweaked the typeface, thickening the stroke and adding ink traps to the corners of the numerals so the sporty typeface can support a coating of Super-LumiNova. "It's only possible due to the thickness of the typography," Paul says. "You couldn't do that on the [Tangente](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-value-proposition-nomos-tangente) because the lines are too thin." The Tangente, by contrast, features minimalist numerals whose roots are squarely in the Bauhaus tradition. NOMOS' designers elongate the thin, Arabic numerals for the dial to create a more linear and rational aesthetic.
