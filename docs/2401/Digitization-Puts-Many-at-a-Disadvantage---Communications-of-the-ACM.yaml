- en: Digitization has many downsides. It puts many people at a disadvantage and relegates
    them to the sidelines. Many service providers apparently are unaware of this,
    or consciously accept it. It disadvantages many weaker, disabled, and older people.
    Digital devices are often more difficult to use than analog ones. The more (mostly
    unused) options, the more difficult it is.

    a power failure. Countless people are overwhelmed by digital cell phones. Digitization
    excludes many people from social or economic life. They are left behind. Without
    computer skills, it is difficult to use ticket machines, for example. Analog coffee
    machines, washing machines, stoves, and refrigerators are more user-friendly than
    digital ones. This is especially true for radios and televisions.

    are penalized by the banks: lower interest rates and higher fees. In Switzerland,
    printed timetables and telephone directories have almost disappeared. There are
    no more (analog) telephone booths. If you don''t have a cell phone, you can no
    longer be reached on the road and are at a loss in emergencies. If a greedy telecommunications
    company switches off the 2G or 3G network, it forces you to buy a new cell phone,
    which is not exactly environmentally friendly.'

- en: Because ticket machines are a pain to use, some people buy expensive, little-used
    annual passes. Many services such as travel and goods can now only be ordered
    or booked online. Without the Internet, access to "social" media is denied and
    access to knowledge and reference works is made more difficult. Digital money
    can be used to monitor the population, whereas analog money also can be used without
    electricity. Older and disabled people have no or only a weak lobby. Their concerns
    are ignored and their needs forgotten. The digital world is often ruthless and
    undemocratic. It also consumes a lot of electrical energy, especially artificial
    intelligence.
