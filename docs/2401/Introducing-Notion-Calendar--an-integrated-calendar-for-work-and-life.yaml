    organize, and prioritize your time across work and life.**'

- en: '*Time is our most precious resource. But over the last decade, the most crucial
    tool for how we manage time — the calendar — has only made us incrementally more
    productive.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Most calendars are disconnected from other tools, which creates a gap between
    how we manage our time and where we spend it. Meetings live separate from project
    timelines, and our work calendar doesn’t know about our personal plans. We miss
    deadlines or get double-booked.*'

- en: '*Today, I’m excited to introduce Notion Calendar. It’s a new way to manage
    time across your work and life. Our vision is to bring the time layer eventually
    into all aspects of Notion (notes, projects, tasks), so that you have a unified
    way to manage all the things competing for your time.*'

- en: Many of you already use Notion to run projects and take your meeting notes (thank
    you!). By bringing relevant documents, project timelines, and task due dates into
    your calendar, it’s much easier to know where to spend time — whether that’s a
    meeting or blocking time for focused work to hit a deadline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without leaving Notion Calendar, you can easily search and connect all relevant
    Notion docs to meetings. For example, if you’re scheduling a sprint planning meeting,
    you don’t have to jump between apps to provide attendees with all the necessary
    context.

- en: You can also view and manage database items in Notion Calendar as events, like
    the deadlines for the sprint planning you’re doing. Notion Calendar is deeply
    integrated with your Notion workspace and all the other tools you’re using as
    part of your workflows — like Google Calendar, Zoom, and Google Meet.

    can be detrimental to productivity (it takes up to [23 minutes to regain focus](https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf)).

- en: Instead, with Notion Calendar, you can see your day’s schedule and join virtual
    meetings right from your computer’s menu bar. If you’re writing a plan for an
    upcoming product launch, you don’t ever have to leave that page to see what meetings
    are coming up or how much time you have until those meetings.

    might lead to getting double-booked or missing important events. Notion Calendar
    brings these two worlds together.
  prefs: []

- en: If you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event
    blocking to automatically block time on each.
  prefs: []

- en: You can see your entire day’s commitments in one place — your upcoming doctor’s
    appointment is visible alongside meetings and project deadlines. And with Notion
    Calendar’s auto-blocking feature, you don’t have to worry about conflicts or double-bookings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Plus, you also have a built in scheduling tool. Share your availability with
    others and allow them to book time directly — while also auto-blocking slots on
    your cal. Colleagues won’t be able to see you have a doctor’s appointment, but
    they will see that time blocked when trying to book a meeting.
