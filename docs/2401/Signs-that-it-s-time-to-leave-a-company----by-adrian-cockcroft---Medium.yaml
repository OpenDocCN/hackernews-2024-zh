- en: I joined AWS about seven years ago, when it was growing fast, there was headcount
    and flexibility in hiring, and Amazon was famously cheap about the office space
    it occupied. I retired a year and a half ago, and many of the people I worked
    with have also left. [Update] Justin Garrison just quit, but before he left he
    just wrote a critical blog post “[Amazon’s Silent Sacking](https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/)”
    about the way they are pushing people out. What changed?

- en: Growth slowed. When companies transition from high growth to slow growth or
    begin shrinking it isn’t just a small change, it needs a fundamentally different
    approach to management and the culture of the company. I saw this play out while
    I was at Sun Microsystems as the dot com bubble burst in 2001–2004\. Adding headcount
    and budget every year covers up all kind of problems, it brings a flexibility
    to operations that becomes part of the culture. When growth is flat to shrinking
    companies freeze like deer in the headlights, and to make it worse managers start
    to hoard headcount and play politics to preserve their products. Innovation goes
    away, micromanagement appears and everyone gets less useful work done. I haven’t
    seen a good way to gradually manage this situation. The most successful approaches
    I’ve seen (which Sun didn’t do) are to cut deeply and early by shutting down entire
    product lines and removing layers of management, so that the company can grow
    back by opening headcount again. It’s like pruning a sickly tree. If you cut off
    the dead leaves one by one, you end up with too many branches and shriveled fruit.
    If you cut back hard, and remove whole branches, the roots provide enough energy
    for the tree to grow back. This does mean that you have to shut down or sell off
    entire product lines, and shrink the business. It’s very hard to contemplate and
    navigate this, which is why most companies don’t do it agressively enough. As
    an employee, it’s usually best to leave in the first wave of cuts.

    and provide new stock options](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2023/08/intel-will-issue-stock-to-offset-workers-pay-cuts.html)
    to compensate. I think this is a good approach for several reasons. If the main
    problem is a lack of revenue growth, due to a general market slowdown, then everyone
    is trying to cut at once. The effective market value of employees has dropped,
    you can hire people for less, so reducing cash flow by cutting salaries makes
    more sense than layoffs. Using the savings to grow by hiring lower cost remote
    employees reduces demand on office space, which should be the first thing you
    cut back on anyway. If the stock price has already dropped then issuing new options
    at the lower price is helpful, it defers the cost and ties it to future success.
    Keeping most of the people you have in place maintains product investment levels,
    which maximizes the chance of keeping revenue and out executing competition. In
    a [fediverse](https://mastodon.social/@adrianco/111746735722569832) discussion
    about this topic one comment was that to get through COVID individual contributors
    took a 10% pay cut, and the CEO took a 50% pay cut, with a sliding scale on the
    way up the org chart.'

    at your company, and you are still there, the product teams that are left after
    pruning should try to keep the most experienced employees, lay off the junior
    ones, and return managers to individual contributor positions where possible.
    Experienced employees have been through this before, make better judgement calls
    under stress, and communicate better. There is a tendency to micromanage and add
    process overhead that needs to be resisted. Simplify processes to [reduce bureaucracy](https://www.amazon.com/Delicate-Art-Bureaucracy-Transformation-Wrestler/dp/1950508153)
    and management overhead, speed up time-to-value, and take advantage of the gaps
    in the market that appear as competitors fail.

    when the founder moves on. I think this is part of the problem at Amazon, and
    I was happy to be leaving as Andy Jassy took over from Jeff Bezos and Adam Selipsky
    took over AWS. Jeff Bezos was always focused on keeping the “Day 1” culture at
    Amazon, and everyone I talk to there is clear that it’s now “Day 2”. Politics
    and micromanagement have taken over, and HR processes take up far too much of
    everyone’s time.

    take up too much management attention. The plans for Amazon HQ2, and the building
    of ever larger and fancier office tower blocks in Seattle by Amazon collided with
    Covid, lockdown and an accelerated work from home movement. The right thing to
    do coming out of lockdown would have been to write down the real estate investment
    in one go, re-negotiate the tax incentives that cities provide, embrace remote
    working, and continue the policy Amazon had at the time, where each director level
    leader could decide what was best for their teams. Instead, we now have the situation
    that Amazon management care more about real estate than product. Where is the
    customer obsession in that? Customers don’t care what the companies buildings
    are like. As Justin says, they are using Return To Office (RTO) to drive people
    out of the company without needing to fire them. By analogy, pruning by cutting
    off the best remaining leaves and fruit buds one at a time, leaving the dead wood
    behind.

    thanking me for saying what they aren’t allowed to say internally. “Disagree and
    commit” has been weaponized to force the RTO policy on everyone. In a group making
    a decision, it’s usually a majority that agree with the decision, and the people
    that don’t agree see that they are outnumbered and commit to it. However with
    RTO I think it is a minority imposing an unpopular policy on everyone else, without
    supporting data or discussion. Disagreeing is career-limiting, so what we are
    seeing is “Disagree and quit”. People are interviewing while waiting for their
    next RSU grant. Someone also said that it’s not “Day 2” it’s “Day 3”, and did
    I know anywhere that is hiring?.'

    in 2002, and in the short term they are going to continue to grow the business
    slowly. However I do think there’s lessons to be learned, and that the delusion
    that they can roll back work from home and enforce RTO without killing off innovation
    is a big problem that will increasingly hurt them over time. I personally hired
    a bunch of people into AWS, in my own team and by encouraging people to join elsewhere.
    Nowadays I’d say a hard no to anyone thinking of working there, they have shown
    that you can’t trust whatever they say during the interview process. Local management
    gets overruled to relocate people hired to be remote, and to move to locations
    that they can change arbitrarily. Try and get a job at somewhere growing rapidly
    with a sensible work location policy like NVIDIA instead.
