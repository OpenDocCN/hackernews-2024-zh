  zh: '**DB：**我们面临的挑战与今天公司所面临的挑战完全相同，而我们能够应对这些挑战的唯一方式就是不断完善我们的内容准则，并非常、非常有意识地——非常、非常严格地执行。我们只是禁止了所有今天允许的各种言论。我们不会允许在平台上发布这些言论。我们做到这一点的方式是，在每个社区内，我们都会为实际用户提供浏览其社区和特定主题的工具，并踢除那些与内容准则不一致的人。我认为我们做到这一点更容易，因为我们是根据特定主题组织的。例如，我们没有一个开放的仇恨言论论坛。如果你在我们的某个社区创建了一个乡村音乐页面，如果它与乡村音乐无关，你就会被踢出去。我们是一个非常精选的社区，利用社区的力量来监督和维护主题的完整性。'
- en: Now, the much larger question about something like Twitter or Facebook—I don’t
    know. I mean, that’s a problem that no one has really been able to solve and I
    think many of these platforms have abdicated their responsibility for dealing
    with hate speech. It could be a role for government in terms of [creating] content
    guidelines. I mean, you can’t go on broadcast television to say the things that
    people say online. You just can’t, there are standards. There are broadcast standards
    that prevent stations from airing that kind of content. There’s certainly a model
    for having standards and content. People forget that. They think, “Oh, you know,
    it can never be done.” You can’t tune into any broadcast channel and see anywhere
    near the hate speech we’re seeing online. So why can’t that be regulated the same
    way it is on broadcast?

  zh: 现在，关于像 Twitter 或 Facebook 这样的东西的一个更大的问题——我不知道。我的意思是，这是一个没有人真正能够解决的问题，我认为许多这些平台已经放弃了他们对处理仇恨言论的责任。这可能是政府在[创建]内容指南方面的一个角色。我的意思是，你不能在广播电视上说人们在网上说的那些话。你就是不能，因为有标准。广播标准阻止电视台播出那种内容。当然有一个关于标准和内容的模型。人们忘记了这一点。他们认为，“哦，你知道，这永远无法做到。”你不能调到任何广播频道上看到我们在网上看到的那种仇恨言论。那么为什么不能像广播上那样对其进行规管呢？
