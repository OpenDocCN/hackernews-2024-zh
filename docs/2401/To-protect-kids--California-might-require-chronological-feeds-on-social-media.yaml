- en: Social media companies design their feeds to be as gripping as possible, with
    complicated algorithms shuffling posts and ads into a never-ending stream of entertainment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A new California law would require companies to shut off those algorithms by
    default for users under 18, and implement other mandated tweaks that lawmakers
    say would reduce the negative mental health effects of social media on children.

- en: The bill, dubbed the Protecting Kids from Social Media Addiction Act by its
    author, state Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), was announced at a news conference
    with California Atty. Gen. [Rob Bonta](https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Rob%20Bonta)
    on Monday, alongside another proposed law that would tighten privacy protections
    for minors.

    "They could act; they have not."'

- en: One of the act's key provisions is making a chronological feed the default setting
    on platforms, which would show users posts from the people they follow in the
    order that they were uploaded, rather than arranging the content to maximize engagement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This change would show young users "the things that they want to see, as opposed
    to the addictive algorithmic feed that is presently being fed to our children,"
    Bonta said.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The act would also require the default settings on social media apps to mute
    notifications between midnight and 6 a.m., cap use at one hour daily, and remove
    the visibility of "like" counts. Parents — and in practice, most likely, the children
    using these apps — would have the ability to change these default settings.

    against Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, alongside
    32 other states, alleging that the company designed its apps specifically to addict
    young users while misleading the public about the adverse effects of these "harmful
    and psychologically manipulative platform features."
  prefs: []

- en: Portions of internal company documents included in that lawsuit show that Meta
    knew that more than a million children under 13 were using Instagram, while company
    officials publicly stated that underage users were not allowed on the platform.
    The suit also alleges that Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, personally
    vetoed a proposal that would have banned filters that simulate the effects of
    plastic surgery, despite pushback over the negative effect on girls' mental health.

    users ran into trouble in the courts last year. A federal judge in San Jose issued
    a temporary injunction against the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act
    in September, ruling that the law likely violates the 1st Amendment rights of
    the tech companies that it seeks to regulate.

- en: The law, which was co-authored by Assemblymember Wicks and signed into law in
    2022, would require companies to provide privacy protections to children by default.
    The court found that enforcement of these provisions could either require more
    data collection — to verify the age of certain users — or limit the content that
    adult users were allowed to see. Bonta's office is appealing the decision.

    U.S. surgeon general last year as evidence of the harms that social media use
    inflicts on minors. That report found that "adolescents who spend more than three
    hours per day on social media face double the risk of experiencing poor mental
    health outcomes," nearly half of adolescents said that social media made them
    feel worse about their body image, and a majority saw "hate-based content" on
    a regular basis.
