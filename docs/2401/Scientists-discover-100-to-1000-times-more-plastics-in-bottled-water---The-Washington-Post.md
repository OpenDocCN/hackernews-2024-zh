# Scientists discover 100 to 1000 times more plastics in bottled water - The Washington Post

People are swallowing hundreds of thousands of microscopic pieces of plastic each time they drink a liter of bottled water, scientists have shown — a revelation that could have profound implications for human health.

A new [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2300582121) released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found about 240,000 particles in the average liter of bottled water, most of which were “nanoplastics” — particles measuring less than one micrometer (less than one-seventieth the width of a human hair).
