    or other tools. For this, we have partnered with Astrella to offer you the option
    for Astrella^Ⓡ by Equiniti to become your cap table provider. If you would like
    a copy of your LTSE Equity data, please reach out to [support@ltse.com](mailto:support@ltse.com).
    To start the process of transferring to Astrella, [please fill out this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1QAhVClS4QPGe22mDNnal8Q5lokp).

    will be a great solution for our customers. Astrella will honor our customers'
    payment terms through your annual renewal date. You’ll have a new login portal,
    but Anashe Barton will still be your point of contact. Anashe has joined the Astrella
    team and will be available to help with your transition to Astrella and to support
    you going forward.

    transition seamless for you. LTSE Equity began to transfer clients when we first
    announced this sunset in 2023, and we have developed a seamless process for you.
    We’ve also developed FAQs to answer some of the questions you may have.
