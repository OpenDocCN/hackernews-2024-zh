- en: 'We are excited to announce the creation of a European project December 1st
    2023, which will run for the next 36 months. This Next Generation Internet pilot
    named "NGI TALER" is operated by a consortium of 11 partners from 8 European countries
    with the mandate to roll out an innovative electronic payment system for the greater
    benefit of European citizens, merchants, and banks. This payment system is different
    from current online payment methods, like credit cards or bank transfers, in that
    it offers privacy for the buyer: neither merchants nor banks can trace or link
    the payments. It is also a no-risk payment option for the merchant as there is
    no equivalent of fake or stolen credit cards, as payments are cleared and confirmed
    instantly. The payment system is socially, ecologically and fiscally responsible:
    it is not a new currency, there is no energy-consuming proof-of-work or proof-of-stake
    method and clearing is processed much faster than payments by credit cards. NGI
    TALER enforces transparency on the merchants so that states ensure that businesses
    can be held accountable for their income and pay their taxes.'

- en: NGI TALER is funded as a pilot under the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative
    within the European Commission's Horizon Europe research funding program. This
    project is based on the free software GNU Taler which has been developed by the
    GNU community and Taler Systems S.A., and which has received wide praise from
    financial experts including experts from several central banks - including the
    Swiss National Bank (SNB). The goal is to make GNU Taler available as payment
    system via two European banks - GLS Bank (Germany) and MagNet Bank (Hungary).
    NGI TALER's ambition is to reach the European market during the project period
    and have the payment mechanism accepted and widely adopted by the end of the project.

- en: Under the hood, GNU Taler deploys state-of-the-art cryptography to achieve these
    features. The initial investment into the required infrastructure is low and the
    payment mechanism operates more cost efficiently than existing payment solutions,
    with lower transaction fees - a benefit that will be shared by consumers and merchants.
    This makes even micro-payments possible, creating an interesting and privacy preserving
    alternative to subscription- or advertisement-based revenue for newspapers and
    other publishers.
