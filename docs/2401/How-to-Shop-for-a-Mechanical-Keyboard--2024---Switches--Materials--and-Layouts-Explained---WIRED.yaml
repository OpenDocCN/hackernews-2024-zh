- en: '**A full-size keyboard** has a layout with everything you’d ever need, and
    usually quite a few keys you don’t too. The full-size keyboard is the most well-known
    keyboard layout, and also one of the largest, consisting of a main cluster of
    letters and numbers, a separate row for function keys (F1 through F12), separate
    arrow keys and extras, and a number pad. This layout is best if you have a lot
    of desk space to spare and want something familiar.'

- en: '**A 96 percent keyboard** is a small step down from a traditional full-size.
    Also called “1800,” the 96 percent layout maintains almost every key while removing
    a good amount of dead space. Named after the [Cherry G80-1800](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/eGmSXGUbC99nAqq9tNEBnKsvaoGZFskAVGg8YVuZyKGqWRfgC8rrfwwxhak6g8Thw7U2ce2HHkZ6cq6HhJgL1ix62SHU17BuJyGtGHwuas7cU7Ltqn6r7iadi7G7bukwdCFRSUhBbZ1),
    this layout moves the number pad closer to the alphanumeric keys, pushes the arrow
    keys down a bit, and moves some of the extra keys into the space above the number
    pad, making a great compromise for users who need a number pad but don’t love
    the massive horizontal footprint of a traditional full-size.'

- en: '**A TKL keyboard** is a great compromise between the practicality of a larger
    board and the compactness of a smaller one, maintaining everything most users
    need while cutting the numpad out of the equation. The TKL name refers to the
    board being “ten-key-less,” referring to the removal of the 10-key number pad
    compared to a full-size layout. In the modern “premium” keyboard space, there
    are also FRL (function-row-less) TKL keyboards, where the top row of F1–F12 are
    cut off to save even more space'

    layout to enter the mainstream. This does the same to a TKL as the 1800 does to
    a full-size keyboard, compressing the arrow keys into the side and moving around
    all the other keys to save some space. Some of the most recent 75 percent keyboards
    include [Razer’s BlackWidow v4 75%](https://www.wired.com/review/razer-blackwidow-v4-75-percent/)
    and the [Mode Sonnet](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/eGmSXGUbC99nAqq9tNEBnKsvaoGZFskAVGg8YVuZyKGqWRfgC8rrfwwxhajhKFDcWDwD3Q9nTVg3PEWXveHoguFs2iwduVnqEzPAj2VqmFtAmsecGMYWx6PYMKwFi8FLppq1ghjUMSf).'

    the top function row in exchange for a function layer over the main number row.
    These keyboards are fairly popular among gamers for their compact, portable design,
    plus the arrow keys are still present for specific games.'

- en: '**A 60 percent keyboard** is the smallest mainstream layout, removing the alphanumeric
    keys from the rest of the keyboard and transplanting them into an incredibly compact
    form factor. This layout is great for people who want to save space, but it will
    require some familiarity with function layers, since the F-row, arrow keys, and
    quite a few other multimedia controls don’t have dedicated keys. While there are
    quite a few different variations of the 60 percent layout, the two most common
    are the traditional ANSI layout, reminiscent of gaming keyboards like the POK3R
    or the compact keyboard found on a laptop, and the niche-but-beloved [HHKB](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9SmxdK1MtTmaoBcNx8yujtrboB2iHxuNdmLHfQKFim1sQtMYY53goS8vQEzCvJPcT1XHYB8FYTArffzAE5gLquHHYPBA1Yx8EBb9Jrd67PS1Coj8rqSMhaQiiwMEg7eS5hvNRt2p7h)

    when shopping for one. Usually, keyboards are described as being either “**clacky**”

- en: A “thocky” keyboard will have a deeper and more rounded typing sound that usually
    comes from using an FR4 (flame retardant fiberglass) or polycarbonate plate, along
    with PBT keycaps, while a “clacky” keyboard will have a higher-pitched, sharper
    typing sound, and will typically come from using aluminum, brass, or carbon fiber
    in the plate and case, along with ABS keycaps.

  zh: “thocky”键盘会发出更深沉、更圆润的打字声音，通常是由使用FR4（阻燃玻璃纤维）或聚碳酸酯板和PBT键帽造成的，而“clacky”键盘会发出更高音调、更尖锐的打字声音，通常是由铝、黄铜或碳纤维板和机壳以及ABS键帽造成的。
