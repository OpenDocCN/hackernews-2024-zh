- en: We sought to evaluate whether residence at high altitude is associated with
    the development of obesity among those at increased risk of becoming obese. Obesity,
    a leading global health priority, is often refractory to care. A potentially novel
    intervention is hypoxia, which has demonstrated positive long-term metabolic effects
    in rats. Whether or not high altitude residence confers benefit in humans, however,
    remains unknown. Using a quasi-experimental, retrospective study design, we observed
    all outpatient medical encounters for overweight active component enlisted service
    members in the U.S. Army or Air Force from January 2006 to December 2012 who were
    stationed in the United States. We compared high altitude (>1.96 kilometers above
    sea level) duty assignment with low altitude (<0.98 kilometers). The outcome of
    interest was obesity related ICD-9 codes (278.00-01, V85.3x-V85.54) by Cox regression.
    We found service members had a lower hazard ratio (HR) of incident obesity diagnosis
    if stationed at high altitude as compared to low altitude (HR 0.59, 95% confidence
    interval [CI] 0.54–0.65; p<0.001). Using geographic distribution of obesity prevalence
    among civilians throughout the U.S. as a covariate (as measured by the Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention and the REGARDS study) also predicted obesity
    onset among service members. In conclusion, high altitude residence predicts lower
    rates of new obesity diagnoses among overweight service members in the U.S. Army
    and Air Force. Future studies should assign exposure using randomization, clarify
    the mechanism(s) of this relationship, and assess the net balance of harms and
    benefits of high altitude on obesity prevention.

    As compared to their counterparts residing in high altitude counties, individuals
    in low altitude counties had over 4 times the prevalence of obesity, after adjusting

    this finding suggests a potential long-term metabolic benefit from hypoxia, the
    dataset lacked duration of residence and temporal sequence of exposure and outcome,
    and was thus limited by the potential of reverse causation. Other studies in Nepal,

    was divided into “segments” of time representing the length of inclusion at a

    defined by the average altitude of the station’s 3-digit unit zip code from WorldClim
    shuttle radar topography maps [[39]](#pone.0093493-Hijmans1) and derived with
    Geospatial Information System software (ArcGIS version 10.0). [[40]](#pone.0093493-USA1)

    Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS). [[40]](#pone.0093493-USA1) There were
    28 observations from segments at a 3 digit zip code for which there was not an
    available altitude; these were included as a missing category. The other altitude
    categories were selected after data collection to create three equidistant intervals
    of 0.98 km, taking advantage of the natural break at 1.96 km (see [Figure 1](#pone-0093493-g001)).

    category, baseline BMI, and home of record (this refers to any location specified
    by the service member–which may indicate location of residence upon military entry
    or intended location of residence after completion of military service). Furthermore,
    to account for income disparities among military members based on duty location,
    the 2009 basic allowance for housing (BAH) averaged over each 3-digit zip (for
    the unmarried, lowest ranking pay-grade) was utilized as an additional covariate,
    based on publically available data. [[41]](#pone.0093493-Defense1) A total of

    U.S. State (such as Europe or Guam) (n = 61,677), or was invalid (n = 23,421).
    One individual was excluded due to missing baseline BMI. If a model includes civilian

    with “time 0” defined as the time when an individual entered the study. Time 0
    began in the middle of the surveillance period for service members who reached
    2 years of active service during the period. For those with gaps in their personnel
    record lasting greater than 6 months, person-time was restarted at time 0 at the
    same location after the gap ended. Censoring occurred when a service member separated
    from military service or changed duty locations, or at the conclusion of the surveillance
    period. Service members with a change in duty location during the surveillance
    period contributed person-time at each location. To account for lack of independence
    when the same individual was observed at different duty stations, a variance estimator
    was used to cluster observations from the same individual (option “vce” clustering
    on the individual using Cox regression in Stata version 12). [[43]](#pone.0093493-stcox1)
    Personnel records in DMSS only document “permanent” duty assignment and do not
    account for time spent away from that location (e.g., while on military leave,
    overseas deployments, and temporary duty assignments). Data analysis was performed

    obese social contacts, and cultural values) could vary between regions or states.
    Assuming no migration and steady state population weight (at the spatial resolution
    assessed), the cumulative (relative) effect of all of these geographic exposures
    should be revealed by the resultant obesity prevalence among civilians in these
    areas. The assumptions create limitations, and the spatial variation at this spatial
    resolution could be partially determined by altitude variation. Nonetheless, obesity
    prevalence provides a surrogate for other, unmeasurable geographic factors. Thus,
    civilian obesity rates were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention’s (CDC) BRFSS for self-reported height and weight at the state level
    [[44]](#pone.0093493-Overweight1) and from the NHANES and REGARDS databases for
    measured height and weight based on the regional level as reported elsewhere.
    [[42]](#pone.0093493-Le1) These percentages were manually assigned to each zip
    code range based on publically available 3-digit zip codes for each state [[45]](#pone.0093493-List1),

    the association between civilian obesity prevalence and military obesity incidence
    could reflect shared behavioral mechanisms (e.g., a common built environment),
    social norming, and social transmission, [[50]](#pone.0093493-Matthews1), [[51]](#pone.0093493-Christakis2)
    service members are partially shielded from these mechanisms by having consistent
    access to healthy foods at military commissaries, a peer group of other military
    members, and incentives to remain physically active, such as periodic physical

    such as environmental pollutants, climatic factors, and hypoxia. Although this
    study cannot entirely discriminate between these exposures, it provides support
    for the hypoxia hypothesis. First, high altitude duty assignment conferred a significant
    protective effect even after adjusting for a home of record of Colorado, the state
    with the lowest obesity prevalence. Second, this association pertained to all
    occupational strata other than aircrew, who were protected regardless of duty
    location, reflecting perhaps their intermittent exposure to the hypobaric conditions
    of aircraft.

- en: The role of hypoxia is also consistent with several hormonal mechanisms proposed
    by other investigators. Leptin, which helps suppress appetite, is transcribed
    under the influence of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) [[52]](#pone.0093493-Grosfeld1).
    Some have found serum leptin rises at high altitude, [[53]](#pone.0093493-SierraJohnson1)
    and the leptin *receptor* also appears upregulated by hypoxia. [[54]](#pone.0093493-Baze1)
    Thus, leptin transcription and signaling alterations could contribute to appetite
    changes even if serum concentration is unchanged. Likewise, other proposed hormonal
    mediators such as cholecystokinin (CCK) [[28]](#pone.0093493-Bailey1) and norepinethrine
    have been shown to increase at altitude, [[55]](#pone.0093493-Young1), [[56]](#pone.0093493-Barnholt1)
    which could influence appetite directly (CCK) or indirectly (norepinephrine) via
    reduced blood flow to the gut [[57]](#pone.0093493-Loshbaugh1). Erythropoietin
    (EPO), which prevents obesity in mice through non-erythroid receptors, [[58]](#pone.0093493-Teng1)
    is another potential factor. Although the extent to which endogenous EPO fluctuates
    with altitude is unclear, it is clearly related to hypoxia and dosing requirements
    of exogenous EPO in kidney failure patients are reduced at high altitude. [[59]](#pone.0093493-Brookhart1)
    EPO phosphylates paroxysome proliferator-activated receptor γ, [[58]](#pone.0093493-Teng1)

    stationed at high altitude, future studies could explore whether such conditions
    are necessary to achieve a similar effect. Long-term exposure to normobaric hypoxemia
    in chronic lung disease is associated with cachexia, which is reversed with ventilatory
    support, [[61]](#pone.0093493-Budweiser1) and short-term pulsatile hypoxia (such
    as in an altitude tent or pressurized aircraft) has also been proposed as a therapy
    for obesity. [[12]](#pone.0093493-Quintero1), [[23]](#pone.0093493-Netzer1) Furthermore,

    have lower body weight. Carbon monoxide, which has been proposed as a therapeutic

    or given by other delivery mechanisms. [[68]](#pone.0093493-Reiter1) In fact,
    the HO-1 inducers are already known to stimulate weight loss and prevent obesity
    in rodents. [[66]](#pone.0093493-Csongradi1), [[67]](#pone.0093493-Hosick1) Furthermore,
    previously documented connections between ferritin, phlebotomy, and insulin resistance
    [[69]](#pone.0093493-Wlazlo1), [[70]](#pone.0093493-Gabrielsen1) have been shown

    caution. Obese individuals may be at greater risk for altitude sickness, particularly
    at an altitude above 3600 meters. [[72]](#pone.0093493-RiLi1) This provides additional
    support for the use of hypoxia as a preventive–as in our study–rather than as
    a therapeutic agent. Mental illness constitutes another potential harmful association
    with hypoxia exposure, as demonstrated recently by the frequency of suicide and
    cocaine abuse at high altitude. [[7]](#pone.0093493-Brenner1), [[73]](#pone.0093493-Fiedler1)
    Hypophagia, while therapeutic for obesity, is also a symptom of depression. Therefore,
    even if the metabolic effects of hypoxia are clearly favorable, the holistic balance
    of benefits and harms may tilt in either direction based on the individual patient.

- en: This study featured a large, relatively homogenous population with longer follow
    up than any previous study identified. Although the findings are consistent with
    earlier interventional trials, [[20]](#pone.0093493-Ge1)–[[28]](#pone.0093493-Bailey1),
    [[74]](#pone.0093493-Hamad1) its longer duration provides a notable contribution
    given the limitations of short-term trials. First, since obesity is a chronic
    disease, short-term benefits are of questionable public health utility unless
    they are sustainable. Second, humans adapt to high altitude exposure, so any short-term
    effect could be attributable to the physiologic changes associated with the adaptation
    process rather than a steady state effect at altitude. Third, some adaptations
    to high altitude could modify body weight without altering body fat. Hemoconcentration,
    for example, would reduce total body water and body mass without reducing body
    fat [[75]](#pone.0093493-Vats1).

    was neither chosen by the participants nor randomly allocated by the investigators–reduced
    the likelihood of residual confounding (i.e., the outcome of obesity would more
    likely reflect the impact of residence itself, rather than the participants’ choice
    of residence). Additionally, the study design is inherently translational due
    to the real world conditions which allows assessment of effectiveness more than
    efficacy. [[76]](#pone.0093493-Kessler1) Finally, outcomes were determined by
    healthcare providers in the routine course of patient care who had no knowledge
    of this investigation.

- en: Nonetheless, the study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. Although
    service members are not free to reside anywhere in the United States, the assignment
    process is not entirely random. Those with a healthier lifestyle may have been
    more likely to request assignment at high altitude, although data on such requests
    are not available. The homogeneity of effect across all career fields, however,
    suggests the assignment process is not responsible for the association seen. Another
    limitation is the use of the so-called “permanent” duty location to define exposure.
    Unplanned cross-over likely occurred during military leave, deployments, and temporary
    duty, thus biasing our results toward the null. In addition, potential confounding
    variables (e.g., smoking status) were not measured. Adjustment for civilian smoking
    prevalence suggested this missing data biased our results to the null. This adjustment
    also suggested that missing smoking data may have partially explained the lower
    than expected obesity hazard in the East South Central census region ([Table 5](#pone-0093493-t005)).

- en: While this study’s military population presents a unique opportunity to evaluate
    a large cohort of frequently migrating humans, it could be argued that such findings
    are not generalizable to the civilian population. Several features of this study,
    however, favor a broader applicability of its findings beyond the U.S. military.
    First, it evaluates an association previously documented among civilians [[32]](#pone.0093493-Voss1)
    using a quasi-experimental design. Second, the findings suggest that service members
    in the study mirrored geographically collocated civilians as it relates to obesity
    outcomes. In fact, incident obesity diagnoses occurred at rates proportionate
    to the prevalence of obesity in the local civilian population. This finding is
    not surprising since the military is made up of a socioeconomically diverse source
    population of civilians who previously resided throughout the United States. Third,
    although screening and training of applicants results in a healthy working population,
    this is not dissimilar to the recruitment process of clinical trials featuring
    healthy subjects. Fourth, military personnel in this study were only included
    after completing at least two years of service, and thus had moved beyond training
    settings with mandated dietary choices and physical training programs. Finally,
    results were consistent across occupational substrata. If the effect of altitude
    on obesity were contingent on something unique to the military lifestyle, one
    would expect occupational substrata classically associated with a military ethos
    (e.g., infantry) to demonstrate a stronger effect size than those in other fields,
    such as healthcare.

- en: Aside from the translational findings relating to obesity, our study also provides
    at least two methodological contributions for making causal inferences of spatial
    determinism. Although the classic components of descriptive epidemiology (i.e.,
    person, place, and time) demonstrate the importance of place in disease pattern
    recognition, analytic techniques are needed to evaluate if a disease is merely
    located in a particular place, or if that place actually exerts a causal influence
    on the development of the disease. Our first contribution to this end is the identification
    of the U.S. military as an ideal source population for investigating the causal
    influence of geographic locations on health. In addition to the characteristics
    we have outlined (i.e., frequent and assigned migration, data availability, and
    generalizability), this population is also appropriate because military members
    may benefit from knowledge of the unique health risks and rewards associated with
    moving to new places. We also demonstrated a novel method of etiologic assessment
    using external data. We compared disease prevalence among the extant local population
    with disease incidence among residents who had recently migrated there, thus accounting
    for unmeasured factors. In this case, by finding an association between civilian
    obesity prevalence and military obesity incidence even in low altitude areas,
    we suspect that geographic determinants of obesity likely extend beyond altitude
    alone. Similarly, we identified and adjusted for one spatial factor (variance
    in smoking behaviors) that could impact newly arrived residents differently than
    long term residents.

- en: In summary, high altitude duty assignment of overweight U.S. military service
    members is associated with lower rate of obesity diagnoses as compared with low
    altitude duty assignment, even after adjusting for state level obesity prevalence.
    Census region residence is a newly identified modifiable risk factor for obesity
    for this population. Furthermore, the study raises many new avenues of research
    with significant implications for global health.
