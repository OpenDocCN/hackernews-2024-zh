    this makes sense: more brain cells, more mental capabilities. Humans, and many
    of the other animals we’ve come to think of as unusually bright, such as chimpanzees
    and dolphins, all have large brains. And it’s long been assumed that the smallest
    brains simply don’t have the capacity to support complex mental processes. But
    what if they do?'

    have the sharpest vision known for animals their size, which is typically just
    1 millimeter to 2.3 centimeters in length. They use this visual prowess to find,

    smarts belong to the genus *Portia*, found in Africa, Asia and Australia. These
    spiders prefer to hunt other spiders and have strategies tailored to each species
    they prey upon. Renowned University of Canterbury jumping spider researcher Robert
    Jackson has discovered that many of [*Portia*’s tactics are quite devious](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.en.41.010196.001443).

- en: When hunting another group of jumping spiders called *Euryattus*, Jackson reports,
    *Portia* employs a clever trick. *Euryattus* females build nests in curled-up
    dead leaves suspended in air by silk attached to rocks or vegetation. Courting
    males crawl down the silk suspension ropes, stand on top of the nest and shake
    it in a specific way. The signal draws the female out of the nest. *Portia* appears
    to take advantage of this system by [mimicking the male’s shake](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00171580)
    and luring the female into an ambush.

- en: For *Portia*, finding the right strategy is especially important when pursuing
    spiders that also eat jumping spiders. To attack a web-building spider, for example,
    *Portia* deceives the spider into moving closer by plucking some of the silk strands
    of its web. If the target spider is relatively small, *Portia* plucks the web
    to mimic a trapped insect, prompting the spider to rush over thinking it’s about
    to have a meal — only to become one instead. But if the resident spider is bigger
    and potentially more dangerous, *Portia* may instead create a gentle disturbance
    similar to a fruit fly contacting a single strand at the edge of the web that
    the spider will slowly wander over to inspect. As soon as the target is close
    enough, *Portia* pounces and strikes with venomous fangs.

- en: If these strategies don’t work on a particular web spider, another of *Portia*’s
    tricks is to shake the whole web so it moves as if a gust of wind had hit it.
    This acts as a smokescreen for the vibration *Portia* makes as it crawls into
    the target spider’s web. In laboratory experiments, Jackson found that *Portia*
    will try different plucking methods, speeds and patterns until it finds just the
    right combination to fool each individual web spider it hunts — essentially [learning
    on the job](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4535141).

    often involves spotting prey from a distance and then planning out an elaborate
    route to get to it. Jackson first observed this in the wild when *Portia* encountered
    a species of orb weaver that [defends its web by violently shaking it](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1992.tb04451.x),
    tossing any invading jumping spiders to the forest floor. Instead of entering
    the web, *Portia* navigated a roundabout path to find a better position from which
    to attack. “In that context, it was better for *Portia* to take the detour, go
    around the tree trunk, go up above the spider, go down on a line of silk, and
    swing in, grab the spider in its web without even touching the silk,” Cross says.

    Cross and Jackson put *Portia*’s mental abilities to the test in the laboratory.
    They built an apparatus with a central viewing tower on a platform, surrounded
    by water, from which a spider can see two other towers topped with boxes: one
    containing dead spiders that *Portia* likes to prey on, and one with dead leaves.
    The only way to reach the prey without getting wet, which jumping spiders loathe,
    is to climb down onto the platform and then choose the correct one of two separate
    walkways leading to the boxes.'

    before descending the tower and climbing up a walkway. Most spiders chose the
    path that led to the meal, even if this meant moving away from the prey and passing
    the incorrect walkway on the way. Cross and Jackson argue that the spiders [planned
    the route](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4751061/) from the viewing
    tower and then followed it, possibly by forming a mental “representation” of the
    scene — an impressive cognitive feat for a brain barely bigger than a poppy seed.

- en: In another test of the idea that *Portia* uses mental representation, Cross
    and Jackson borrowed a classic psychology experiment designed to assess the cognition
    of human infants. Since infants, like spiders, can’t tell you what’s on their
    mind, the idea is to deduce what they understand by seeing what surprises them.
    For example, a baby who sees a toy fire truck move behind the left side of a barrier,
    and then sees either the fire truck or a stuffed rabbit come out on the right
    side will tend to stare at the unexpected rabbit longer than the fire truck that
    emerged as expected. This suggests the baby had formed a mental representation
    of the fire truck and was baffled when the rabbit didn’t match it.

    for the spiders to view. First they would show *Portia* one type of prey for 30
    seconds. Then they would close a shutter on the front of the display and swap
    out the prey before reopening the shutter 90 seconds later. If *Portia* first
    saw a dewdrop spider, but then saw an orb weaver, what would *Portia* do?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scientists discovered that if *Portia* saw a different kind of prey after
    the shutter was lifted, it was far less likely to attack than if the prey remained
    the same. They assert that this shows that the spider [formed a mental representation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946049/)
    of the prey at the beginning of the trial that didn’t match what it saw at the
    end.

    Using a species from Kenya, *Portia africana*, Cross and Jackson let *Portia*
    see a number of prey items from the viewing tower, and then switched up the number
    of prey items while the spider was en route and the target was out of sight. They
    found that if *Portia* had seen one prey spider from the tower but arrived to
    find two spiders, it was less inclined to carry out an attack. The same was true
    for one versus three prey items, and two versus three, and also when it encountered
    only one item after initially having been shown two or more. When tested with
    larger quantities, the spiders didn’t distinguish between three or higher, lumping
    them all into one category of “many.”

    as Nelson found. Her lab at the University of Canterbury developed a test to see
    how good *Portia* is at assessing escape routes. Though they can swim, jumping
    spiders hate water, and for these experiments a spider started on a platform surrounded
    by a tray filled with water. It had four ways to get across the water to the edge
    of the tray that involved leaping between little islands made of wooden dowels
    sticking out of the water.

    the fewest jumps more often than chance would predict. But when they didn’t choose
    the safest way, the spiders unexpectedly seemed to prefer the longest route with
    the most dowels. It turns out *Portia* had simply outsmarted the test: The longest
    path was curved, and *Portia* often [took shortcuts](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/30/5/1488/5522035?login=true)
    by skipping dowels. “Basically, they just cheated,” Nelson says.'

    like these — sometimes several hours — and usually much, much longer than other
    jumping spiders that Nelson tested, she says. Nelson found a clear relationship
    between the time a spider spent surveying the route and the likelihood of choosing
    a safe path. “Seeing is thinking, in my view,” she says. “*Portia* spent a lot
    more time looking at the route before making a decision.”
