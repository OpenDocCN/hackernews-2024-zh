- en: We’re sure Ubisoft must be quaking in its boots right now because of a lawsuit
    being brought against it by a seriously disgruntled fan.

- en: The issue comes from [Ubisoft](https://www.gamingbible.com/ubisoft) cancelling
    and shutting down a fan-favourite title. We reported on the [sad news back in
    December 2023](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/steam/ubisoft-removes-popular-game-from-steam-forever-812652-20231215#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20we%20bring%20sad%20news,the%20end%20of%20March%202024.),
    and although fans have had a few weeks to come to terms with the news, it seems
    not all of them will accept it.

- en: YouTuber Ross Scott, aka Accursed Farms, has made it known that he intends to
    file a class-action lawsuit against the publishers for how it “took money” from
    *The Crew* gamers under the guise of a “perpetual licence”, yet, as Scott claims,
    this isn’t what they received.

- en: “I think the argument to make is that *The Crew* was sold under a perpetual
    licence, not a subscription, so we were being sold a good, not a service,” Ross
    explains.

    the point of sale [...] This is a high-profile game that was sold in stores under
    a perpetual licence, and the buyers are going to be left with nothing. This is
    about as perfect an opportunity as we’re going to get to challenge the system
    on this.”

    pull off against the [Assassin’s Creed](https://www.gamingbible.com/assassins-creed)
    publisher. Of course, the lawsuit might not even happen yet, as Scott is still
    amassing evidence from others affected by the closure of the game to see the potential
    the lawsuit actually has.

- en: What is more, Scott says he anticipates that Ubisoft could go for a no-fault
    settlement, yet it’s a move he would push back against. “In that scenario, if
    I have any say in the matter, I will push to not accept any offer like that.”
    He adds, “The point is actually bigger than the game and bigger than Ubisoft.
    I’m trying to stop games people want to keep and pay money from being destroyed.”
