- en: In 2008, a Dutchman played a crucial role in the United States and Israeli-led
    operation to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. The then 36-year-old Erik van Sabben
    infiltrated an Iranian nuclear complex and released the infamous Stuxnet virus,
    paralyzing the country’s nuclear program. The AIVD recruited the man, but Dutch
    politicians knew nothing about the operation, the [Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/aivd-speelde-cruciale-rol-bij-sabotage-kernprogramma-iran~ba24df9f/)
    reports after investigating the sabotage for two years.

    AIVD and MIVD had recruited the infiltrator in this sabotage operation. But at
    the time, it was believed to have been an Iranian engineer. In the meantime, the
    newspaper continued to investigate the matter, speaking to dozens of people involved,
    including 19 employees of the AIVD and MIVD.

    nuclear complex in the city of Natanz and installed equipment infected with the
    highly sophisticated Stuxnet virus. According to the newspaper, the software cost
    over a billion dollars to develop. It caused a large number of nuclear centrifuges
    to break down, delaying the nuclear program by several years, according to estimates.

    used in the operation, the Volkskrant wrote. According to the investigative journalists,
    the intelligence services knew they were participating in the sabotage of the
    Iranian nuclear program but not that their agent was bringing in Stuxnet. “The
    Americans used us,” one intelligence source told the Volkskrant.

    at all. According to the newspaper, the Stiekem committee, which translates to
    “secret committee," where the largest political parties are informed about the
    intelligence services’ actions, also knew nothing about the Netherlands participating
    in this operation.

- en: Van Sabben immediately left Iran after successfully sabotaging the country’s
    nuclear program, the researchers concluded. He died two weeks later in a motorcycle
    accident near his home in Dubai. Nothing points to foul play, the Volkskrant said
    after speaking with people at the crash scene. Though, an anonymous MIVD employee
    told the newspaper that Van Sabben “paid a high price.”

- en: Van Sabben was recruited by the AIVD in 2005, according to the newspaper. His
    technical background, many contacts in the region, and links with Iran - he already
    did business in Iran and was married to an Iranian woman with family in the country
    - made him ideal for the mission.

    praised Van Sabben as an engineer who made an important contribution to the Gulf
    State. The article noted that he traveled a lot for his work, mentioning Iran
    along with Sudan, Yemen, and East Africa. According to the Volkskrant, Van Sabben
    released Stuxnet into the Natanz nuclear complex during one of those trips to
    Iran. The virus was likely in a water pump that Van Sabben had installed there.

    why the government and parliament did not know about it. The intelligence services
    told the newspaper they cannot comment substantively on the publication. An anonymous
    executive at the AIVD said that the government may have deliberately not been
    informed of the operation due to the potential political consequences. It was
    customary to “sweep the Prime Minister’s doorstep clean,” they said.
