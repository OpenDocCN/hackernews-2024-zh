- en: In 2008, a Dutchman played a crucial role in the United States and Israeli-led
    operation to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. The then 36-year-old Erik van Sabben
    infiltrated an Iranian nuclear complex and released the infamous Stuxnet virus,
    paralyzing the country’s nuclear program. The AIVD recruited the man, but Dutch
    politicians knew nothing about the operation, the [Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/aivd-speelde-cruciale-rol-bij-sabotage-kernprogramma-iran~ba24df9f/)
    reports after investigating the sabotage for two years.

  zh: 2008年，一名荷兰人在由美国和以色列领导的行动中发挥了关键作用，以破坏伊朗的核计划。当时36岁的埃里克·范萨本渗透到了伊朗的一个核复合物，并释放了臭名昭著的Stuxnet病毒，使该国的核计划瘫痪。据《沃尔克斯克朗特报》在调查了两年的破坏行动后报道，AIVD招募了这名男子，但荷兰政治家对此一无所知。
- en: A few years ago, the Volkskrant revealed that the Dutch intelligence services
    AIVD and MIVD had recruited the infiltrator in this sabotage operation. But at
    the time, it was believed to have been an Iranian engineer. In the meantime, the
    newspaper continued to investigate the matter, speaking to dozens of people involved,
    including 19 employees of the AIVD and MIVD.

  zh: 几年前，《沃尔克斯克朗特报》披露说，荷兰情报机构AIVD和MIVD曾招募过这名破坏行动中的渗透者。但当时，人们认为这是一名伊朗工程师。与此同时，该报继续调查此事，与数十名涉及人员进行了交谈，包括AIVD和MIVD的19名雇员。
- en: They told the newspaper that Dutchman Van Sabben infiltrated the underground
    nuclear complex in the city of Natanz and installed equipment infected with the
    highly sophisticated Stuxnet virus. According to the newspaper, the software cost
    over a billion dollars to develop. It caused a large number of nuclear centrifuges
    to break down, delaying the nuclear program by several years, according to estimates.

  zh: 他们告诉报纸，荷兰人范萨本（Van Sabben）渗透到了位于纳坦兹市的地下核复合物，并安装了感染了高度复杂的Stuxnet病毒的设备。据报纸称，该软件的开发成本超过十亿美元。据估计，它导致大量核离心机损坏，使核计划推迟了数年。
- en: No one in the Netherlands knew that this new type of cyber weapon was being
    used in the operation, the Volkskrant wrote. According to the investigative journalists,
    the intelligence services knew they were participating in the sabotage of the
    Iranian nuclear program but not that their agent was bringing in Stuxnet. “The
    Americans used us,” one intelligence source told the Volkskrant.

  zh: 没有人在荷兰知道这种新型网络武器在行动中被使用，《沃尔克斯克朗特报》写道。调查记者称，情报机构知道他们参与了对伊朗核计划的破坏，但并不知道他们的特工带来了Stuxnet。“美国人利用了我们，”一位情报消息源告诉《沃尔克斯克朗特报》。
- en: Strikingly, the Balkenede IV Cabinet apparently was not informed about the operation
    at all. According to the newspaper, the Stiekem committee, which translates to
    “secret committee," where the largest political parties are informed about the
    intelligence services’ actions, also knew nothing about the Netherlands participating
    in this operation.

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，巴尔肯德四号内阁显然根本不知道这次行动。据报纸称，斯蒂克姆委员会，即“秘密委员会”，在这里，最大的政治党派被告知情报机构的行动，也对荷兰参与此次行动一无所知。
- en: Van Sabben immediately left Iran after successfully sabotaging the country’s
    nuclear program, the researchers concluded. He died two weeks later in a motorcycle
    accident near his home in Dubai. Nothing points to foul play, the Volkskrant said
    after speaking with people at the crash scene. Though, an anonymous MIVD employee
    told the newspaper that Van Sabben “paid a high price.”

  zh: 研究人员得出结论，范萨本在成功破坏该国核计划后立即离开了伊朗。两周后，他在迪拜家中附近的一起摩托车事故中去世。《沃尔克斯克朗特报》在与事故现场的人们交谈后表示，没有任何迹象表明有人故意行凶。不过，一位匿名的荷兰国防情报和安全局（MIVD）员工告诉报纸，范萨本“付出了很高的代价”。
- en: Van Sabben was recruited by the AIVD in 2005, according to the newspaper. His
    technical background, many contacts in the region, and links with Iran - he already
    did business in Iran and was married to an Iranian woman with family in the country
    - made him ideal for the mission.

  zh: Van Sabben于2005年被荷兰情报局招募，据报。他的技术背景、在该地区的许多联系以及与伊朗的联系——他曾在伊朗做生意，并与伊朗妇女结婚，有家人居住在那个国家——使他成为执行任务的理想人选。
- en: After his death, an article in the United Arab Emirates newspaper The National
    praised Van Sabben as an engineer who made an important contribution to the Gulf
    State. The article noted that he traveled a lot for his work, mentioning Iran
    along with Sudan, Yemen, and East Africa. According to the Volkskrant, Van Sabben
    released Stuxnet into the Natanz nuclear complex during one of those trips to
    Iran. The virus was likely in a water pump that Van Sabben had installed there.

  zh: 他去世后，《阿联酋国家报》一文赞扬范萨宾是一位对海湾国家做出重要贡献的工程师。文章指出，他为工作频繁出差，提到了伊朗以及苏丹、也门和东非。据《Volkskrant》报道，范萨宾在访问伊朗期间在纳坦兹核设施释放了Stuxnet病毒。该病毒很可能在范萨宾安装的水泵中。

- en: Several parliamentarians demanded clarification about the operation, including
    why the government and parliament did not know about it. The intelligence services
    told the newspaper they cannot comment substantively on the publication. An anonymous
    executive at the AIVD said that the government may have deliberately not been
    informed of the operation due to the potential political consequences. It was
    customary to “sweep the Prime Minister’s doorstep clean,” they said.

  zh: 几位议员要求对该行动进行澄清，包括为什么政府和议会不知情。情报机构告诉报纸，他们不能对出版物进行实质性评论。荷兰情报局一位匿名高管表示，政府可能故意不被告知该行动，因为可能产生政治后果。据他们称，惯例上是“将首相的门口打扫干净”。
