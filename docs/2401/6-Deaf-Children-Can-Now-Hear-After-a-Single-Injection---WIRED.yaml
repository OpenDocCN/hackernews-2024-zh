- en: To get the new genetic material into cells, they engineered harmless viruses
    to carry it. Doctors carefully injected a tiny amount of liquid containing the
    viruses into a part of the children’s inner ears called the cochlea, a spiral-shaped
    chamber that contains hair cells. The first patient in the trial received the
    gene therapy in December 2022\. Researchers followed the participants, who ranged
    in age from 1 to 6 years old, for 23 weeks after treatment.

    they went from not hearing anything under 95 decibels—about as loud as a food
    processor or motorcycle—to perceiving sounds of around 45 decibels—the level of
    a typical conversation or the hum of a refrigerator.

    at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University and an author on the paper. For
    some of the parents, it’s the first time they’ve heard their children say “mama”
    or “baba” (Chinese for “papa”).

- en: Other children in the study had previously received a cochlear implant in one
    ear and had already learned to speak. In those cases, doctors injected the gene
    therapy into their other ear. Cochlear implants are surgically implanted devices
    that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide a sense of sound to its wearer. The
    implants don’t reproduce natural hearing, though. The resulting sound can be robotic
    or distorted. And when they’re switched off, the wearer can’t hear at all.

    When they followed up with patients after the injection, they turned off the cochlear
    implants to assess how well the therapy was working in the children.

    says Zheng-Yi Chen, an associate scientist at Mass Eye and Ear, who co-led the
    study.

- en: One child’s hearing didn’t improve at all. One explanation, Shu says, is that
    the child had preexisting immunity to the type of virus used to carry the new
    gene into the inner ear cells—meaning the treatment would have been destroyed
    by their immune system before it could take effect. It’s also possible that the
    dose was too low to be effective, Lustig says.

    Boston-based Akouos, which was acquired by Eli Lilly in 2022, has treated two
    subjects in a clinical trial that began last year. Eli Lilly [announced this week](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene)
    that one of those participants, an 11-year-old boy, could hear within 30 days
    of receiving an otoferlin gene therapy.

    as part of an ongoing clinical trial. Otovia Therapeutics in China and Sensorion
    of France are working on similar treatments. The Fudan University trial reported
    today was funded by Refreshgene Therapeutics of Shanghai.

- en: Colin Johnson, a biochemist at Oregon State University who studies otoferlin,
    calls the results of the Chinese and US studies a “dramatic development.” Scientists
    have been interested in restoring otoferlin for years but have struggled with
    how to get the gene inside virus particles. The otoferlin gene is large—about
    6,000 DNA letters long—and doesn’t fit into the viruses used for gene therapy.
    Scientists eventually figured out they could split the gene in two and deliver
    the pieces separately. When tested in mice, the gene came together in the inner
    ear and allowed them to hear.
