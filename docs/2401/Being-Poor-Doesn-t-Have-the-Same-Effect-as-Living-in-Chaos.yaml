    titled “Throwaway Kids” reports researchers surveyed “nearly 6,000 inmates in
    12 states — representing every region of the country — to determine how many had
    been in foster care and what effect it had on their lives. Of the inmates who
    took the survey, 1 in 4 said they were the product of foster care. Some spent
    the majority of their childhood in strangers’ homes, racking up more placements
    than birthdays.”

    Families and values were pretty similar across the board. Even when data were
    collected from children of single parents, most of those children were raised
    in neighborhoods where most of the parents were married, and attended schools
    with classmates whose parents were mostly married. Genes will always play a large
    role in the trajectory of our lives, but as variation in family type expands,
    my strong suspicion is that the environment will account for more and more of
    the variance in outcomes between individuals.

    the 1930s). White working class. My grandfather dropped out of school in eighth
    grade to work and earn money for his parents. When my grandfather was 21, my grandmother
    (age 18) accepted his proposal after he agreed to give up smoking, drinking, and
    gambling. They relocated from the midwest to Oregon in search of work. They were
    married for 60+ years, created a strong intact family, and had 3 biological children
    and then adopted my adoptive mother. Their 3 biological children (born in the
    1950s and 60s) all grew up and got married. All got divorced. Some remarried.
    They all had kids (my cousins). Despite the divorces, these boomers still believed
    in marriage and still remember the old ways. What life was like before the western
    cultural revolution. This is where things take a sharp turn. My cousins (born
    in the 1980s) all grew up. None got married. All of them have kids. Some of them
    have kids with multiple different partners who they no longer speak with. These
    kids (born in the 2000s) have weird non-natural hair colors, aggressive piercings,

    children and grandchildren. They had the same genes. But they lived in a different
