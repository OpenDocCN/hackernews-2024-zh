    Because ~~we're obsessed~~ we care about your watching enjoyment, we wrote down
    all the recurring gags in every episode — including the new season 4 episodes
    — with special attention to jokes hidden in the background ([like Cloudmir vodka](joke-83.html))
    or being foreshadowed ([like when Buster lost his hand](joke-122.html)).
