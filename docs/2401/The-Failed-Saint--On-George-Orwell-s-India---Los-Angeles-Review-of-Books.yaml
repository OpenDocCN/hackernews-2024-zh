    ignited the nonviolent civil disobedience movement, or “satyagraha,” for which

- en: You see the same nuanced approach in his anti-colonial essays, and it has given
    his critics ammunition against him. For example, he wrote an audacious essay about
    Gandhi a year after his assassination and within a year of Orwell’s own death
    from tuberculosis. He saw Gandhi as a good man and a devoted revolutionary, and
    he admired him for his rare egalitarian convictions in a caste-heavy context—“he
    did not think of people in terms of race or status.” Yet he criticized him for
    his passivism and ascetic, sober ways. It wasn’t personal—“even Gandhi’s worst
    enemies would admit that he was an interesting and unusual man who enriched the
    world simply by being alive”—but rather a tactical and perhaps aesthetic concern.
    It isn’t that “the average human being is a failed saint,” Orwell wrote, but that
    “[m]any people genuinely do not wish to be saints.” In this group, Orwell included
    himself. To wish for sainthood would be to lose some part of one’s humanity.

  zh: 在他的反殖民主义文章中，你可以看到同样细腻的态度，这给了他的批评者对他的抨击的弹药。例如，他在甘地遇刺一年后，奥威尔写了一篇大胆的文章，在自己死于肺结核一年内。他把甘地看作是一个善良的人和一个忠实的革命者，他钦佩他在一个以种姓为重的环境中罕见的平等信念——“他不会按种族或地位来思考人们。”然而，他批评了他的被动主义和禁欲、清醒的方式。这并不是个人问题——“甚至甘地的最坏的敌人也会承认他是一个有趣和不寻常的人，他简单地因为活着而丰富了世界”——而是一个战术上的，也许是审美上的关切。奥威尔写道，问题不在于“普通人是失败的圣人”，而在于“许多人确实不想成为圣人。”在这个群体中，奥威尔包括了自己。渴望成为圣人将意味着失去一部分人的人性。

- en: It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy
    a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle,
    I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it
    is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive [...]
