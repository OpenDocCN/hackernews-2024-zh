    to tyranny, or the rights of the working class. These were recurring subjects
    in the author’s expansive oeuvre and preoccupations in his private life. What

    every year, on Orwell’s birthday, the Rotary Club’s Orwell committee invites academics
    to give talks on the author’s relevance to the area. A few dozen people usually

- en: You see the same nuanced approach in his anti-colonial essays, and it has given
    his critics ammunition against him. For example, he wrote an audacious essay about
    Gandhi a year after his assassination and within a year of Orwell’s own death
    from tuberculosis. He saw Gandhi as a good man and a devoted revolutionary, and
    he admired him for his rare egalitarian convictions in a caste-heavy context—“he
    did not think of people in terms of race or status.” Yet he criticized him for
    his passivism and ascetic, sober ways. It wasn’t personal—“even Gandhi’s worst
    enemies would admit that he was an interesting and unusual man who enriched the
    world simply by being alive”—but rather a tactical and perhaps aesthetic concern.
    It isn’t that “the average human being is a failed saint,” Orwell wrote, but that
    “[m]any people genuinely do not wish to be saints.” In this group, Orwell included
    himself. To wish for sainthood would be to lose some part of one’s humanity.

- en: It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy
    a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle,
    I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it
    is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive [...]
    and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone—one mind less,
    one world less.

    justification for the punishment. The essay can be read instead as an indictment
    of both the death penalty and the whole colonial apparatus, but it also cleaves

- en: In “Why I Write,” Orwell says that a primary goal when he sits at his typewriter
    is to tell the truth and “to make political writing into an art.” That is what
    he is doing in “A Hanging”— making political writing into an art. “An enormous
    relief had come upon us now that the job was done,” he writes after describing
    the hanging. “One felt an impulse to sing, to break into a run, to snigger. All
    at once everyone began chattering gaily.” Someone makes a joke, and they all laugh
