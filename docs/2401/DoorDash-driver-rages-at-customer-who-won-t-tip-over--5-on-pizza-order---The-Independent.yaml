    lovely Dasher Corey believes I should be tipping 50%” she captioned the [clip](https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.tiktok.com%252F%2540ladybug3660%252Fvideo%252F7250842190782516522%26sref%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Flife-style%2Fcustomer-tip-pizza-order-tiktok-b2482141.html&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Flife-style%2Fcustomer-tip-pizza-order-tiktok-b2482141.html&article_id=2482141&author=Brittany+Miller&tag=customer%2CTikTok%2CPizza&section=&category=&sub_category=&updated_time=2024-01-20T22%3A58%3A26.000Z&utm_campaign=news-body&utm_term=B-2&utm_content=&utm_medium=&ref=&utm_source=direct&fbclid=&gclid=).

    across the screen clarifies was a $20 pie. “I just want to say, it’s a nice house
    for a $5 tip,” the man replies as he walks away.

    good tip. 25%. Ppl are going to stop tipping in general bc of this greed,” one
    comment read.

    the tip before they accept the order….” a third commenter wrote.

    the driver was fired and Purciful was refunded her tip. “Respectfully asking for
    a tip is acceptable but abusing or harassing someone is never acceptable,” the
    DoorDash spokesperson told the outlet in an email.

    week a restaurant customer refused to pay a tip after being [charged with an 18
    per cent gratuity](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/reddit-customer-tip-charged-gratuity-b2480533.html).

    forum, a customer posted their receipt in which they were charged a gratuity of
    18 per cent for a meal that cost $73.94\. “An 18% gratuity was ‘voluntary’ yet
    automatically added to my bill for 2 guests,” they wrote. “Swipe left to see the
    choice I made.”

    of the gratuity, and to top it off, did not tip their server whatsoever. On the
    receipt, the restaurant disclosed the gratuity policy in fine print.

    read. “Please feel free to increase, decrease or remove the gratuity. This gratuity
    will be paid to your server, is voluntary and added for your convenience. Thank
    you for your business!”

    behalf.

    be no tip line, extra buttons to click on or push, and no cashier standing there
    watching if you are tipping or not. If they want to tip, they can do it like it
    was just a couple of years ago. The customer simply told the cashier to add so
    much for a tip.”

    One user replied, saying: “So it’s not forced on you, right? I mean, you can tip
    what you want...as long as it’s: (a) 18%; or (b) having an awkward conversation
    with the server telling them to adjust or remove the tip.”'
