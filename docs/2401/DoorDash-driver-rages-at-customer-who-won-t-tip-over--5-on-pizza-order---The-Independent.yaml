    the driver was fired and Purciful was refunded her tip. “Respectfully asking for
    a tip is acceptable but abusing or harassing someone is never acceptable,” the

    week a restaurant customer refused to pay a tip after being [charged with an 18

    forum, a customer posted their receipt in which they were charged a gratuity of
    18 per cent for a meal that cost $73.94\. “An 18% gratuity was ‘voluntary’ yet
    automatically added to my bill for 2 guests,” they wrote. “Swipe left to see the

    论坛上的一篇帖子中，一位顾客发布了他们的账单，其中一顿饭花费了73.94美元，收取了18%的小费。“一个18%的小费是‘自愿的’，但是自动添加到了我的2位客人的账单上，”他们写道。“向左滑动以查看我做出的选择。”
- en: Angry over the bill, the user showed in the second photo that they opted out
    of the gratuity, and to top it off, did not tip their server whatsoever. On the
    receipt, the restaurant disclosed the gratuity policy in fine print.

  zh: 用户对账单感到愤怒，第二张照片显示他们选择取消了小费，并且完全没有给服务员留下小费。在收据上，餐厅在小字中披露了小费政策。
- en: “Please note that an 18% gratuity has been added to your check,” the policy
    read. “Please feel free to increase, decrease or remove the gratuity. This gratuity
    will be paid to your server, is voluntary and added for your convenience. Thank
    you for your business!”

- en: “People shouldn’t have to ‘opt out’ of anything,” one person wrote. “There should
    be no tip line, extra buttons to click on or push, and no cashier standing there
    watching if you are tipping or not. If they want to tip, they can do it like it
    was just a couple of years ago. The customer simply told the cashier to add so
    much for a tip.”

- en: '“The option to remove it is so stupid because what?!” another person commented.
    One user replied, saying: “So it’s not forced on you, right? I mean, you can tip
    what you want...as long as it’s: (a) 18%; or (b) having an awkward conversation
    with the server telling them to adjust or remove the tip.”'

  zh: 另一位评论者说：“删除它的选项太愚蠢了，因为为什么？！” 一位用户回复说：“所以它不是强制给你的，对吧？我的意思是，你可以随意给小费...只要是：(a)
    18%; 或者 (b) 与服务员进行尴尬的交谈，告诉他们调整或取消小费。”
