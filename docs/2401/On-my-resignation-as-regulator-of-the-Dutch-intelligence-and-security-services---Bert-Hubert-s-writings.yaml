- en: Until today I was one of the three members of the board that checks warrants
    for the Dutch intelligence and security services. This board is called “[Toetsingscommissie
    Inzet Bevoegdheden](https://tib-ivd.nl/)” or TIB.

- en: If either of the civil or the military intelligence and security services of
    The Netherlands want to use their lawful intercept, SIGINT or hacking (& some
    other) legal powers, they have to first convince their own jurists, then their
    ministry and finally the TIB. The TIB then [studies if the warrant is legal](https://english.aivd.nl/about-aivd/the-intelligence-and-security-services-act-2017/regulatory-commission),
    and that decision is binding.

    in English](https://www.tib-ivd.nl/binaries/tib/documenten/jaarverslagen/2022/05/24/annual-report-tib-2021/Annual+Report+TIB+2021.pdf).

    intelligence and security services were doing precisely the kinds of things you’d
    expect such services to do. I also found that our regulatory mechanisms worked
    as intended - if anything was found to be amiss, the services would actually stop
    doing that. If the ex-ante regulator (ie, my board) ruled a permission to do something
    was unlawful, it would indeed not happen. I think it is important to affirm this
    in public.

    amend the Dutch intelligence law ([English language translation](https://english.aivd.nl/about-aivd/the-intelligence-and-security-services-act-2017)).

    set to be passed by parliament.

- en: Under this new law, my specific role (technical risk analysis) would mostly
    be eliminated. In addition, the Dutch SIGINT (bulk interception) powers would
    be stripped of a lot of regulatory requirements. Furthermore, there are new powers,
    like using algorithmic analysis on bulk intercepted data, without a requirement
    to get external approval. Finally, significant parts of the oversight would move
    from up front (’ex ante’) to ongoing or afterwards (’ex post’).
  prefs: []

- en: Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly
    self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they
    simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for
    clear and concise requests to the regulator.

- en: A regulator that has to investigate ongoing affairs however is in a different
    position. It can easily become overloaded, especially if it is unable to recruit
    sufficient (technical) experts. In the current labor market, it is unlikely that
    a regulator will be able to swiftly recruit sufficient numbers of highly skilled
    computer experts able to do ongoing investigations of sophisticated hacking campaigns
    and bulk interception projects. An overloaded regulator does not provide good
    coverage. It is also vulnerable to [starve the beast tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast).

    would have to resign anyhow, since I don’t agree with the new expanded powers
    and the changes in oversight.

    new law. The regulatory board itself is staffed with excellent people, but by
    design, the board only operates within the existing law. It is not responsible
    for formulating or even criticizing any new laws.

    now.

    help, but at least it is better than watching democratic backtracking in silence.

    Its staff and members are an impressive bunch, and I wish them the best of luck

    track record of resigning when things go wrong, know that I’m available.
