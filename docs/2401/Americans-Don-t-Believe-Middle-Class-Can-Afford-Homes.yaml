    on January 18 among 1,500 eligible voters in the U.S., also showed some Americans
    thought the median cost of a house was lower than what the market was offering,

    buying property in the U.S elusive for millions of Americans. For middle-class
    Americans, where owning a house can be a builder of wealth and a platform for
    financial well-being, the dream of acquiring a home has appeared out of reach.

    home in December was $382,600](https://www.newsweek.com/home-sales-disappointing-milestone-prices-increase-1862313),
    an increase of 4.4 percent from the same time a year ago. Existing home sales

    for sale. Sellers of homes have been reluctant to put their houses in the market
    as they would rather retain their properties at the low rates they secured than
    sell and enter a mortgage market characterized by expensive home loans.
