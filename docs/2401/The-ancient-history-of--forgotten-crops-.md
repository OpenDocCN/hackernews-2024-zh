# The ancient history of 'forgotten crops'

> 来源：[https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/news/orphan-crops](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/news/orphan-crops)

The study by Fuks et al. is a first publication of the recently founded **Crop History Consortium** (CHC), dedicated to synthesis research on historical cultivation, usage, and geographic and evolutionary trajectories of crop plants, focusing on the Middle East and Mediterranean regions of the past 2,000 years.

“What we want to do with the CHC is to scale up crop history research to produce multi-regional, multi-period and multi-disciplinary syntheses which address the big picture without sacrificing the rigor and nuance that comes with detailed, micro-scale research”, says lead author Daniel Fuks.

“We hope that these syntheses will help focus future research efforts on key questions and knowledge gaps, while also facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations in crop history research. Our ‘Orphan crops’ paper is a key initial step at doing just that.”

This long-term approach to agricultural biodiversity continues a tradition of like-minded research coming out of the [McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/institutes-and-facilities-overview/mcdonald-institute-archaeological-research), the [Department of Archaeology](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/) and the University of Cambridge more generally. This includes pioneering work by [Emeritus Prof. Martin Jones’](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/mkj12) team on the domestication and dispersal of millets, as well as [*Food Globalisation in Prehistory*](https://www.foglip.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/index.html). It also includes different projects on long-term agricultural change in India ([*TwoRains*](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/recently-completed-projects/tworains) and [*Land, Water and Settlement*](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/archived-projects/land-water-and-settlement) projects, headed by [Prof. Cameron Petrie](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/cap59), and the interdepartmental [TIGR2ESS project](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/archived-projects/tigr2ess-transforming-indias-green-revolution-research-and)). The [Cambridge Global Food Security Initiative](https://www.globalfood.cam.ac.uk/) is a multi-departmental research group which promotes interdisciplinary approaches to the study of food systems.

The CHC grew out of the *Moving Plants* workshop on first-millennium CE crop diffusion in the Middle East and Mediterranean held at and funded by the [McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/institutes-and-facilities-overview/mcdonald-institute-archaeological-research), University of Cambridge, in May 2022\.

This was immediately followed by a seed meeting organised by Daniel and Jérôme and funded by the [**Higher Education, Research and Innovation (HERI) Department of the French Embassy in London**](https://uk.ambafrance.org/-Science-Tech-), where the CHC was founded.

Since then, the CHC has prepared for publication the *Moving Plants* workshop proceedings, organized a special session at the 2023 [**European Archaeology Association conference**](https://www.e-a-a.org/EAA/Conferences/EAA/Navigation_conferences/EAA_conferences.aspx?hkey=214646c8-7764-4c8a-851a-fc06cb3a0838) on ‘**Interdisciplinary Integration in Reconstructing Agricultural Crop Histories**’, and now published its first collaborative interdisciplinary synthesis paper.

But the CHC is not only focused on academic outputs.

“We also plan to produce digital engagement tools for informing and engaging general audiences with knowledge on the histories and heritages surrounding crop plants, and their relationship to global challenges concerning biodiversity and food security”, says the team.

By synthesising crop history research and making it accessible to wider audiences, the CHC aims to fulfil an important gap in archaeologically- and historically-informed efforts to **conserve agrobiodiversity and agricultural heritage**.
