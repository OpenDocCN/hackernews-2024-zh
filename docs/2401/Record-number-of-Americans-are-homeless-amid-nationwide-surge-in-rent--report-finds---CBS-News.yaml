    Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, roughly 653,000 people reported experiencing
    homelessness in January of 2023, up roughly 12% from the same time a year prior
    and 48% from 2015\. That marks the largest single-year increase in the country's
    unhoused population on record, Harvard researchers said.

  zh: 根据哈佛大学住房研究联合中心于2024年1月25日发布的[报告](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf)显示，大约有653,000人报告称于2023年1月经历了无家可归的状况，比前一年同期增加了约12%，比2015年增加了48%。哈佛研究人员表示，这标志着该国无家可归人口的年度增加创下了历史新高。

    also increased in historically more affordable parts of the U.S.. Arizona, Ohio,
    Tennessee and Texas have seen the largest growths in their unsheltered populations

- en: That alarming jump in people struggling to keep a roof over their head came
    amid blistering inflation in 2021 and 2022 and as surging rental prices across
    the U.S. outpaced worker wage gains. Although a range of factors can cause homelessness,
    high rents and the expiration of pandemic relief last year contributed to the
    spike in housing insecurity, the researchers found.

  zh: 在2021年和2022年通货膨胀加剧的情况下，人们为了维持生计而苦苦挣扎的人数激增，与此同时，全美范围内租金的飙升超过了工人工资的增长。尽管各种因素都可能导致无家可归，但高昂的租金和去年疫情救助的到期使住房不安全性激增，研究人员发现。
- en: '"In the first years of the pandemic, renter protections, income supports and
    housing assistance helped stave off a considerable rise in homelessness. However,
    many of these protections ended in 2022, at a time when rents were rising rapidly
    and increasing numbers of migrants were prohibited from working. As a result,
    the number of people experiencing homelessness jumped by nearly 71,000 in just
    one year," according to the report.'

  zh: “在疫情初期，租户保护措施、收入支持和住房援助有助于避免无家可归问题的显著上升。然而，许多这些保护措施在2022年结束，那时租金迅速上涨，并且越来越多的移民被禁止工作。因此，仅仅一年时间，无家可归的人数就增加了近71,000人。”报告称。
- en: Rent in the U.S. has steadily climbed since 2001\. In analyzing Census and real
    estate data, the Harvard researchers found that half of all U.S. households across
    income levels spent between 30% and 50% of their monthly pay on housing in 2022,
    defining them as "cost-burdened." Some 12 million tenants were severely cost-burdened
    that year, meaning they spent more than half their monthly pay on rent and utilities,
    up 14% from pre-pandemic levels.

  zh: 从2001年开始，美国的租金一直在稳步上涨。哈佛研究人员在分析人口普查和房地产数据时发现，在2022年，无论收入水平如何，美国一半的家庭每月支付的房屋费用占其收入的30%至50%，被定义为“负担成本”。那一年，大约有1200万租户的负担成本严重，意味着他们每月的租金和水电费超过了他们收入的一半，比疫情前的水平增加了14%。
