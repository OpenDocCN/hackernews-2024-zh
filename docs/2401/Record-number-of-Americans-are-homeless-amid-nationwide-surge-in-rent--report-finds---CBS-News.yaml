    Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, roughly 653,000 people reported experiencing
    homelessness in January of 2023, up roughly 12% from the same time a year prior
    and 48% from 2015\. That marks the largest single-year increase in the country's
    unhoused population on record, Harvard researchers said.

    also increased in historically more affordable parts of the U.S.. Arizona, Ohio,
    Tennessee and Texas have seen the largest growths in their unsheltered populations
    due to rising local housing costs.

    amid blistering inflation in 2021 and 2022 and as surging rental prices across
    the U.S. outpaced worker wage gains. Although a range of factors can cause homelessness,
    high rents and the expiration of pandemic relief last year contributed to the
    spike in housing insecurity, the researchers found.

    housing assistance helped stave off a considerable rise in homelessness. However,
    many of these protections ended in 2022, at a time when rents were rising rapidly
    and increasing numbers of migrants were prohibited from working. As a result,
    the number of people experiencing homelessness jumped by nearly 71,000 in just
    one year," according to the report.'

    estate data, the Harvard researchers found that half of all U.S. households across
    income levels spent between 30% and 50% of their monthly pay on housing in 2022,
    defining them as "cost-burdened." Some 12 million tenants were severely cost-burdened
    that year, meaning they spent more than half their monthly pay on rent and utilities,
    up 14% from pre-pandemic levels.
