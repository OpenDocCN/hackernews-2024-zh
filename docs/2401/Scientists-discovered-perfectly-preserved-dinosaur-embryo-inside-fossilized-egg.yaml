    that the egg could help reveal an incredible link between [modern birds](https://www.unilad.com/animals)
    and [dinosaurs](https://www.unilad.com/dinosaurs).

    feathered maniraptoran dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period) and, upon its analysis,
    was estimated to date back as far as 72 million years.

    as it wasn't like others that had been seen.

    of [Geosciences](https://www.unilad.com/science) (Beijing), the embryo was described
    as having a bird-like posture as its head was lying below the body, with the feet
    on either side and the back curled along the blunt end of the egg.

    which is yet more evidence that many features characteristic of today’s birds
    first evolved in their dinosaur ancestors," said Professor Steve Brusatte from
    the University of Edinburgh, who was part of the research team.'

    Yingliang'' - it is preserved in a great condition and helps us answer a lot of
    questions about dinosaur growth and reproduction with it.'

    a similar way inside the egg, which possibly indicates similar prehatching behaviours.”
