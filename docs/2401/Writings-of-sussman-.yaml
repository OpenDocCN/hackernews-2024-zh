    several large buildings in Moutain View, built by SGI in the early 90's back when
    they were the 'hot company'. The buildings are spacious, and if you don't want
    to travel all the way across campus on foot, you can always hop on one of the
    many motorized scooters or segways to buzz around.

    of engineers walking around, sharing ideas, mulling in the halls and between buildings.
    Three separate cafeterias, on-site gym with trainers, swimming pools, laundry.
    All free. There's also on-site masseuses and oil changes, heavily subsidized.

    like I do. It's really hard to resist snacking constantly. I managed to eat way
    too much the first couple of days, got sick, then had to very carefully measure
    my intake the rest of the week. I felt like a mouse with infinite cheese laid
    before me. No wonder they have personal trainers in the gym! Instead of gaining
    the 'freshman 15' in college, everyone at Google talks about gaining the "first
    year 20".

- en: Most software companies are driven by management. Folks in suits (marketeers
    and middle-management) talk to customers, figure out what they want, then tell
    the programmers what to write, usually through several levels of chain-of-command.
    It's not uncommon for two programmers sitting next to each other to not even know
    what the other is working on.

    have PhD''s, and everyone treats the place like a giant research playground. While
    the company is hush-hush to the outside world, it''s 100% open on the inside.
    Everyone knows what everyone is doing, everyone is working on pet projects. Every
    once in a while, a manager skims over the bubbling activity, looking for products
    to "reap" from the creative harvest. The programmers *completely* drive the company,
    it''s really amazing. I kept waiting for people to walk up to me and ask me if
    I had declared my major yet. They not only encourage personal experimentation
    and innovation, they *demand* it. Every programmer is required to spend 20% of
    their time working on random personal projects. If you get overloaded by a crisis,
    then that 20% personal time accrues anyway. Nearly every Google technology you
    know (maps, earth, gmail) started out as somebody''s 20% project, I think.'

    was exposed to many amazing technologies. I'm rather stunned at the things going
    on inside Google... I wonder if the Pentagon will be able to keep up! This is
    truly the cutting edge -- bleeding edge -- of computer science research. Every
    technology that Google releases to the public is heavily tested internally first,
    so I got to spend the week testing a bunch of incredible things that the world
    hasn't yet seen, which is really exciting.

- en: Even the IT department works differently. In every building, there are little
    offices called "tech stops". They sort of look like miniature computer stores.
    If you have a problem with your computer, just walk it right into the tech stop
    and show a technician. They generally help you on the spot. If you need hardware,
    just ask. "Hey, I need a new mouse"... "sure, what kind would you like?", says
    the tech, opening a cabinet full of peripherals. No bureaucracy, no forms, no
    requests. Just ask for hardware, and get it. The same goes for office supplies...
    cabinets full of office supplies everywhere, always stocked full. Just take what
    you need, whenever you feel like it.

  zh: 甚至 IT 部门的工作方式也不同。每栋大楼里都有被称为“技术站”的小办公室。它们看起来有点像微型电脑店。如果你的电脑出了问题，只需把它拿到技术站，展示给一位技术员看。他们通常会立即帮你解决问题。如果你需要硬件，只需提出要求。“嘿，我需要一只新鼠标”……“当然，你想要哪种？”，技术员打开一个装满外设的柜子说道。没有官僚主义，没有表格，没有申请。只需提出硬件需求，就能得到满足。办公用品也是如此……到处都是装满办公用品的柜子，而且总是满满地摆满了。想要什么就拿什么，随时都可以。

    Still, the techstop guys told me that my new Linux machine (with TWO 24" flat-panel

    told. The techstop guys also gave me something called an "ipass", which is a piece
    of software that allows me to use wireless internet in essentially every wi-fi-hotspot

    a lot of power this last week.
