- en: Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language
    is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action
    do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language — so the argument
    runs — must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle
    against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles
    to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious
    belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape
    for our own purposes.

    and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence of this or that
    individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original
    cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so on indefinitely.
    A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail
    all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is
    happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our
    thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for
    us to have foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern
    English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation
    and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble. If one
    gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a
    necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against
    bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional
    writers. I will come back to this presently, and I hope that by that time the

    image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically ‘dead’ (e. g. iron
    resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally
    be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a
    huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely
    used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves.
    Examples are: *Ring the changes on, take up the cudgel for, toe the line, ride
    roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, no axe
    to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day,
    Achilles’ heel, swan song, hotbed*. Many of these are used without knowledge of
    their meaning (what is a ‘rift’, for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are
    frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is
    saying. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning
    without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, *toe the
    line* is sometimes written as *tow the line*. Another example is *the hammer and
    the anvil*, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst
    of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other

    有时被写成 *牵引线*。另一个例子是 *锤子和砧板*，现在总是暗示砧板受到了最严重的打击。在现实生活中，总是砧板打破了锤子，从来不是反过来：一个停下来思考自己在说什么的作者会避免歪曲原始短语。

    for, have the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take
    effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of,* etc., etc. The keynote is
    the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, such as *break,
    stop, spoil, mend, kill,* a verb becomes a *phrase*, made up of a noun or adjective
    tacked on to some general-purpose verb such as *prove, serve, form, play, render*.
    In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the
    active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (*by examination of*
    instead of *by examining*). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of
    the *-ize* and *de-* formations, and the banal statements are given an appearance
    of profundity by means of the *not un-* formation. Simple conjunctions and prepositions
    are replaced by such phrases as *with respect to, having regard to, the fact that,
    by dint of, in view of, in the interests of, on the hypothesis that*; and the
    ends of sentences are saved by anticlimax by such resounding commonplaces as *greatly

    human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality,* as used in art criticism, are strictly
    meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable
    object, but are hardly ever expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes,
    ‘The outstanding feature of Mr. X''s work is its living quality’, while another
    writes, ‘The immediately striking thing about Mr. X''s work is its peculiar deadness’,
    the reader accepts this as a simple difference opinion. If words like *black*

    would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political

    far as it signifies ‘something not desirable’. The words *democracy, socialism,
    freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice* have each of them several different meanings
    which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like *democracy*,
    not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted
    from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic
    we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that
    it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it
    were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously
    dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition,
    but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements
    like *Marshal Petain was a true patriot, The Soviet press is the freest in the
    world, The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution,* are almost always made

    original meaning fairly closely, but in the middle the concrete illustrations
    — race, battle, bread — dissolve into the vague phrases ‘success or failure in
    competitive activities’. This had to be so, because no modern writer of the kind
    I am discussing — no one capable of using phrases like ‘objective considerations
    of contemporary phenomena’ — would ever tabulate his thoughts in that precise
    and detailed way. The whole tendency of modern prose is away from concreteness.
    Now analyze these two sentences a little more closely. The first contains forty-nine
    words but only sixty syllables, and all its words are those of everyday life.
    The second contains thirty-eight words of ninety syllables: eighteen of those
    words are from Latin roots, and one from Greek. The first sentence contains six
    vivid images, and only one phrase (‘time and chance’) that could be called vague.
    The second contains not a single fresh, arresting phrase, and in spite of its
    ninety syllables it gives only a shortened version of the meaning contained in
    the first. Yet without a doubt it is the second kind of sentence that is gaining
    ground in modern English. I do not want to exaggerate. This kind of writing is
    not yet universal, and outcrops of simplicity will occur here and there in the
    worst-written page. Still, if you or I were told to write a few lines on the uncertainty

  zh: 这是一个讽刺，但不是一个非常恶劣的讽刺。例如，上面的展品（3）包含了几处相同类型的英文。可以看到，我并没有做一个完整的翻译。句子的开头和结尾相当接近原意，但在中间，具体的例子
    —— 比赛、战斗、面包 —— 渐渐变成了模糊的短语‘在竞争活动中的成功或失败’。这是必须的，因为我所讨论的这种类型的现代作家 —— 没有一个能够使用‘对当代现象的客观考虑’这样的短语
    —— 绝不会用那种精确而详细的方式列出他的想法。现代散文的整个趋势是远离具体性。现在更仔细地分析一下这两个句子。第一个句子包含四十九个单词，但只有六十个音节，而且所有的词都是日常用语。第二个句子包含三十八个单词，有九十个音节：这些单词中有十八个来自拉丁语根，一个来自希腊语。第一个句子包含六个生动的形象，只有一个短语（‘时间和机会’）可以称为模糊。第二个句子没有一个新鲜、引人注目的短语，尽管它有九十个音节，但它只是给出了第一个句子中包含的意义的一个简化版本。然而，毫无疑问，第二种类型的句子正在赢得现代英语的地位。我不想夸张。这种写作方式尚未普及，即使是在写得最糟糕的一页中，简单明了的表达也会时不时地出现。尽管如此，如果你或我被要求写几行关于人类命运的不确定性，我们可能会更接近我的想象中的句子，而不是《*传道书*》中的句子。
- en: 'As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking
    out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make
    the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which
    have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable
    by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It
    is easier — even quicker, once you have the habit — to say *In my opinion it is
    not an unjustifiable assumption that* than to say *I think*. If you use ready-made
    phrases, you not only don''t have to hunt about for the words; you also don''t
    have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally
    so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a hurry
    — when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech
    — it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like *a consideration
    which we should do well to bear in mind* or *a conclusion to which all of us would
    readily assent* will save many a sentence from coming down with a bump. By using
    stale metaphors, similes, and idioms, you save much mental effort, at the cost
    of leaving your meaning vague, not only for your reader but for yourself. This
    is the significance of mixed metaphors. The sole aim of a metaphor is to call
    up a visual image. When these images clash — as in *The Fascist octopus has sung
    its swan song, the jackboot is thrown into the melting pot* — it can be taken
    as certain that the writer is not seeing a mental image of the objects he is naming;
    in other words he is not really thinking. Look again at the examples I gave at
    the beginning of this essay. Professor Laski (1) uses five negatives in fifty
    three words. One of these is superfluous, making nonsense of the whole passage,
    and in addition there is the slip — *alien* for akin — making further nonsense,
    and several avoidable pieces of clumsiness which increase the general vagueness.
    Professor Hogben (2) plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write
    prescriptions, and, while disapproving of the everyday phrase *put up with*, is
    unwilling to look *egregious* up in the dictionary and see what it means; (3),
    if one takes an uncharitable attitude towards it, is simply meaningless: probably
    one could work out its intended meaning by reading the whole of the article in
    which it occurs. In (4), the writer knows more or less what he wants to say, but
    an accumulation of stale phrases chokes him like tea leaves blocking a sink. In
    (5), words and meaning have almost parted company. People who write in this manner
    usually have a general emotional meaning — they dislike one thing and want to
    express solidarity with another — but they are not interested in the detail of
    what they are saying. A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will
    ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words
    will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh
    enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put
    it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not
    obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind
    open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. The will construct your
    sentences for you — even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent — and
    at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning
    even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics
    and the debasement of language becomes clear.'

  zh: '[我试图表明，现代最糟糕的写作并非为了选择单词的含义而进行字词的拣选，也不是为了编造图像以使含义更加清晰。它的本质是将已经被别人排好序的长条字词黏贴在一起，然后通过纯粹的虚伪来使其呈现出一定的样子。这种写作方式的吸引力在于它很简单。使用现成的短语不仅不必费心去寻找合适的词语；而且也不必费心去处理句子的韵律，因为这些短语通常都是被安排得或多或少悦耳的。当你匆忙写作时——比如对速记员口述，或者做公开演讲时——很自然地会陷入一种装腔作势、拉丁化的风格中。像是“我们应该记住的一个考虑因素”或“我们所有人都会欣然同意的结论”这样的标签会让很多句子免于沉闷。通过使用陈旧的比喻、类比和习语，你可以省去很多精神努力，但代价是你的含义变得模糊，不仅对于读者而言，也对于你自己而言。这就是混合比喻的意义所在。比喻的唯一目的是唤起视觉形象。当这些形象冲突时——就像“法西斯章鱼已经唱过了它的天鹅之歌，战靴被扔进了熔炉”这样——可以肯定作者没有看到他所命名的对象的心理形象；换句话说，他并没有真正思考。再回顾一下我在本文开头给出的例子。拉斯基教授（1）在53个词中使用了五个否定词。其中一个是多余的，整段文字变得无意义，而且还有一次失误——“alien”（外来的）写成“akin”（类似）——导致进一步的无意义，并且还有几处可以避免的笨拙之处增加了整体的模糊性。霍格本教授（2）对一个能够写处方的电池玩弄把戏，并且，虽然不喜欢日常用语“忍受”，但又不愿查字典看看“egregious”（极坏的）是什么意思；（3）如果我们对此持有一种不太仁慈的态度，就是简直没有意义：也许通过阅读其出现的整篇文章，我们能够理解其意图。在（4）中，作者多少知道自己想说什么，但是一堆陈旧的短语像阻塞在水槽中的茶叶一样阻碍着他。在（5）中，字词与含义几乎已经分道扬镳。以这种方式写作的人通常具有一种总体的情感含义——他们不喜欢一件事，并且想要表达对另一件事的团结——但他们对自己所说的内容的细节并不感兴趣。一个细心的作者在他写的每一个句子中都会问自己至少四个问题，即：我想要表达什么？什么词语能够表达它？什么图像或习语会使其更加清晰？这个图像是否足够新鲜以产生影响？而且他可能还会问自己两个问题：我是否能够更简洁地表达？我是否说了一些可以避免的难看的东西？但你并不需要为此大费周章。你可以通过简单地敞开心扉，让现成的短语涌入来规避这些问题。它们会为你构建句子——甚至为你思考——在必要时它们还会为你提供重要的服务，部分地掩盖你的意思，甚至是对于你自己也是如此。这正是政治与语言贬低之间的特殊联系变得清晰的地方。](https://example.org)'

    it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel,
    expressing his private opinions and not a ‘party line’. Orthodoxy, of whatever
    colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to
    be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White papers and the speeches
    of undersecretaries do, of course, vary from party to party, but they are all
    alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, homemade turn of
    speech. When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating
    the familiar phrases — *bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny,
    free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder* — one often has a curious
    feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a
    feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the
    speaker''s spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes
    behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind
    of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The
    appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved,
    as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is
    making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost
    unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church.
    And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate
    favourable to political conformity.'

  zh: 在我们这个时代，普遍认为政治写作是糟糕的写作。 如果不是这样，通常会发现作者是某种叛逆者，表达他的私人意见而不是‘党的路线’。 无论是什么颜色的正统似乎都要求一种死气沉沉、模仿的风格。
    在传单、社论、宣言、白皮书和副部长演讲中可以找到的政治方言，当然，因党派而异，但它们都相似，几乎从不会在其中找到新鲜、生动、自制的言辞。 当一个人看着台上一些疲惫的老手机械地重复熟悉的词语——*残忍、暴行、铁脚镣、血腥的暴政、世界自由人民、肩并肩站立*——往往会产生一种奇怪的感觉，觉得自己并不是在看一个活生生的人类，而是一种假人：这种感觉在光线照到演讲者的眼镜，把它们变成空白的圆盘，看起来好像没有眼睛在后面的时刻突然变得更加强烈。
    这并不全是幻想。 使用那种措辞的演讲者在很大程度上已经变成了一个机器。 他的喉咙里发出了适当的声音，但他的大脑并没有参与进来，就像他自己选择单词一样。 如果他正在发表的演讲是他习惯于一遍又一遍地做的，他可能几乎没有意识到自己在说什么，就像一个在教堂里说出反应的人一样。
    如果这种降低的意识状态不是必不可少的，至少对政治一致性是有利的。
- en: 'In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible.
    Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations,
    the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments
    which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the
    professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist
    largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless
    villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside,
    the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this
    is called *pacification*. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent
    trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called *transfer
    of population* or *rectification of frontiers*. People are imprisoned for years
    without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic
    lumber camps: this is called *elimination of unreliable elements*. Such phraseology
    is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.
    Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism.
    He cannot say outright, ‘I believe in killing off your opponents when you can
    get good results by doing so’. Probably, therefore, he will say something like

  zh: 在我们这个时代，政治言论和写作很大程度上是在为无法辩护的事情辩护。像继续英国在印度的统治、苏联的清洗和驱逐、在日本投放原子弹等事情确实可以辩护，但只能用大多数人无法面对的残酷论据来辩护，而且这些论据与政党的公开宣称不一致。因此，政治语言在很大程度上必须由委婉说法、含糊其辞和纯粹的模糊不清组成。无辜的村庄被从空中轰击，居民被赶到乡间，牛被机枪扫射，棚屋被点燃：这被称为*和平化*。数百万农民被剥夺了农场，只能随身携带的东西走在路上：这被称为*人口转移*或*边界矫正*。人们被关押多年而不受审判，或者在脖子后面被枪杀，或者被送去在北极木材营地死于坏血病：这被称为*消除不可靠因素*。如果一个人想要在不唤起心理图像的情况下命名事物，就需要这样的措辞。例如，考虑一下某位舒适的英语教授为俄罗斯的极权主义辩护。他不能直言不讳地说，‘我相信在可以通过这样做获得良好结果时消灭你的对手’。因此，他可能会说类似这样的话：

    the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain
    curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant

    not only of achieving a radical transformation of Germany''s social and political
    structure in such a way as to avoid a nationalistic reaction in Germany itself,
    but at the same time of laying the foundations of a co-operative and unified Europe.’
    You see, he ‘feels impelled’ to write — feels, presumably, that he has something
    new to say — and yet his words, like cavalry horses answering the bugle, group
    themselves automatically into the familiar dreary pattern. This invasion of one''s
    mind by ready-made phrases (*lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation*)

    or spirit of a language goes, this may be true, but it is not true in detail.
    Silly words and expressions have often disappeared, not through any evolutionary
    process but owing to the conscious action of a minority. Two recent examples were
    *explore every avenue* and *leave no stone unturned*, which were killed by the
    jeers of a few journalists. There is a long list of flyblown metaphors which could
    similarly be got rid of if enough people would interest themselves in the job;

    to reduce the amount of Latin and Greek in the average sentence, to drive out
    foreign phrases and strayed scientific words, and, in general, to make pretentiousness

    every avenue*和*leave no stone unturned*，都是被一些记者的嘲笑所淘汰的。还有一长串陈腐的比喻，如果足够多的人对这项工作感兴趣，同样也可以摆脱；并且也有可能通过开导的方式使*not

- en: 'To begin with it has nothing to do with archaism, with the salvaging of obsolete
    words and turns of speech, or with the setting up of a ‘standard English’ which
    must never be departed from. On the contrary, it is especially concerned with
    the scrapping of every word or idiom which has outworn its usefulness. It has
    nothing to do with correct grammar and syntax, which are of no importance so long
    as one makes one''s meaning clear, or with the avoidance of Americanisms, or with
    having what is called a ‘good prose style’. On the other hand, it is not concerned
    with fake simplicity and the attempt to make written English colloquial. Nor does
    it even imply in every case preferring the Saxon word to the Latin one, though
    it does imply using the fewest and shortest words that will cover one''s meaning.
    What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other
    way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them.
    When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want
    to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until
    you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract
    you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious
    effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job
    for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it
    is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one''s meaning as
    clear as one can through pictures and sensations. Afterward one can choose — not
    simply *accept* — the phrases that will best cover the meaning, and then switch
    round and decide what impressions one''s words are likely to make on another person.
    This last effort of the mind cuts out all stale or mixed images, all prefabricated
    phrases, needless repetitions, and humbug and vagueness generally. But one can
    often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs rules
