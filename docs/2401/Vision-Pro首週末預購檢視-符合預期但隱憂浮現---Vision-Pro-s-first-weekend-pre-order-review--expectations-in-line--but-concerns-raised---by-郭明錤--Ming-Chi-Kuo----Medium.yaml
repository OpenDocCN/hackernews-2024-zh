- en: The immediate sold-out when pre-orders opened confirms earlier predictions.
    However, the inability to sustain a steady increase in pre-order demand is a major
    concern and also confirms earlier concerns about whether the intensity of demand
    can be sustained. Click [***here***](https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1744575069589008525)and[***here***](https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1745518174169391275)for
    details of my previous predictions.

    160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend.

    with shipping times for all models extending to 5–7 weeks within hours.

    a key concern emerged: shipping times remained unchanged 48 hours after pre-orders
    opened. It indicates that demand may quickly taper off after the core fans and
    heavy users place their orders.'

    times typically increase to several weeks within hours. However, unlike Vision
    Pro, iPhone models usually continue to see a steady increase in shipping times
    24 to 48 hours after pre-orders open, indicating that demand continues to grow
    even after the initial sold-out.

- en: Media reports have suggested that supply chain partners such as assembler Luxshare
    will work overtime during the Lunar New Year to meet demand, meaning better than
    expected demand for Vision Pro. However, the reality is that because there is
    still room for improvement in Vision Pro production efficiency, Luxshare has been
    working full-time overtime since the start of mass production to offset the impact
    of production efficiency on shipments.

- en: Achieving a shipment volume of 500,000 units for Vision Pro this year should
    not be challenging. However, because demand tapers off quickly after the initial
    sold-out, it’s critical to closely monitor demand in other markets and application
    updates to assess changes in demand.

- en: Apple has a massive user base of over 1.2 billion active users. As long as about
    0.007% of users are willing to buy after pre-ordering, Vision Pro can sell out
    after opening for pre-order. So, right now, Vision Pro is still a very niche product.
