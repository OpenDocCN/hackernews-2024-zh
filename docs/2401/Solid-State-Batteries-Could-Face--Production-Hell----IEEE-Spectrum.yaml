- en: Recent solid-state battery announcements by [Volkswagen](https://www.vw.com/en.html)
    and [QuantumScape](https://www.quantumscape.com/) are raising hopes in the electric-vehicle
    market, but automotive battery experts are warning that the road to widespread,
    solid-state success is still a long and arduous one. A single breakthrough, as
    if from above, is not likely to turn the whole industry on its nose anytime soon.

    and former chief technology officer for the Chinese battery giant [Contemporary
    Amperex Technology Ltd](https://www.catl.com/en/). (CATL). “But it’s going to
    be just like lithium-ion was in terms of the length of time it will take to hit
    the market. And lithium-ion took a long time to get there.”

    by [Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/press-releases/powerco-confirms-results-quantumscapes-solid-state-cell-passes-first-endurance-test-18031),
    [QuantumScape](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-millionaire-maker-103600618.html),
    [Toyota](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-roll-out-solid-state-battery-evs-couple-years-india-executive-says-2024-01-11/),

    However, these same experts noted a pointed skepticism toward the technical merits
    of these announcements. None could isolate anything on the horizon indicating
    that solid-state technology can escape the engineering and “production hell” that
    lies ahead.

    (currently in use for more limited, often medical, applications) for cars and
    trucks. The adoption curve, experts say, will depend on the product’s ability
    to be validated in terms of performance, life, and cost characteristics.

    are seen as a key to the future of the [electric car](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-10-ev-battery-makers)
    because they potentially offer greater safety and energy, as well as much faster
    recharge times. Solid-state cells differ from conventional lithium-ion batteries
    in their use of a [glass](https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-glass-battery-news-hydroquebec)
    or [ceramic electrolyte](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ion-storage-systems-ceramic-electrolyte-news-solid-state-batteries),
    instead of a liquid composed of lithium salts. Automakers are keen on solid-state
    batteries’ future, because the technology offers greater thermal stability than
    liquid-based batteries, thus allowing for substantially faster recharge, among
    other advantages.

    and mainstream automakers alike. In early January, Volkswagen Group’s [PowerCo
    SE](https://www.powerco.de/) battery company [said it tested lithium-metal cells](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/press-releases/powerco-confirms-results-quantumscapes-solid-state-cell-passes-first-endurance-test-18031)
    from [QuantumScape](https://www.quantumscape.com/), achieving 1,000 charging cycles
    with 95 percent of the cell’s capacity still intact. The company said in a statement
    that the cell’s life-performance was analogous to “an electric car that could
    drive more than 500,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) without any noticeable loss
    of range.”

    batteries](https://spectrum.ieee.org/toyota-solid-state-battery) in an unnamed
    number of production vehicles by 2027\. The automaker said it is targeting a 1,000-km
    (600-mile) range with 80 percent DC fast-charge in 10 minutes or less. In December,
    Chinese automaker [NIO](https://www.nio.com/et7) also got in the game, saying
    it is introducing a 150-kilowatt-hour “semi-solid-state battery” that would theoretically
    offer a 1,000-km range as soon as this summer.

- en: Experts were quick to point out, however, that NIO’s battery, made by [WeLion
    New Energy Technology Co.](http://www.solidstatelion.com/en/about/), is not solid-state.
    “This is in fact a fairly conventional NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) cell with
    a gel electrolyte that has been in production for 15 years and is typically referred
    to as lithium-polymer,” noted Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for [Guidehouse
    Insights](https://guidehouseinsights.com/). “Technically the gel is considered
    a semi-solid because it has properties of both a solid and liquid. But in a cell,
    it lacks the properties of a true solid-state electrolyte.” Notably, he said,
    semi-solid-state cells can be punctured on impact, which is closer to the nature
    of a traditional lithium-ion battery—and in contrast with actual solid-state cells,
    which would fracture. He also noted that semi-solid-state cells, with a manganese
    spinel chemistry, were used on a [Hyundai Sonata hybrid in 2009](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-goes-high-tech-with-sonata-its-first-hybrid/).

    to engineering validation. Galyen cites five “golden rules” of batteries–safety,
    performance, life, cost, and environmental–which must be met for solid-state cells
    to achieve industry-wide adoption.

    in 2018.

    five golden rules,” he said. “I haven’t seen anyone publish life numbers that
    make any sense. And I haven’t seen cost numbers that are even close to competing
    with liquid-state, lithium-ion batteries.” Solid-state costs, he said, are about
    where conventional lithium-ion batteries were a decade ago.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automakers also still need to verify the “performance rule” in three key areas–performance
    at temperature, performance at altitude, and performance under shock and vibration.
    Of those, Galyen said, shock and vibration are particularly concerning. “What
    happens when you’re driving down I-75 and you hit a big pit in the road?” he said.
    “What kind of damage would be done to the solid-state matrix?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automakers will not move to broad adoption until they are able to verify the
    new technology’s abilities in all those key areas, Galyen added. “None of these
    batteries have been validated yet,” he said. “So how do you plan on putting something
    into automotive production when it hasn’t been validated?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Validation will take time, while automakers test factory-built cells in real-world
    conditions. To do that, manufacturers will first need to build battery factories,
    which could take two years, and then run a half-year of prototype products and
    distribute them to customers, who put them through their duty cycles. “Then you
    put the products into production and find out what your ‘gotchas’ are,” Galyen
    said of the inevitable problems.

    in 2018\. Back then, Musk declared his company was about enter into six months
    of the so-called “hell” as it struggled to work out the kinks in its Model 3 production
    line. He told [reporters at the time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-trip-through-hell-inside-the-2018-scramble-to-avoid-the-collapse-of-tesla-11627660800)

    are numerous versions of solid-state batteries using everything from traditional
    graphite to silicon to lithium metal in the anode, and there are cathodes made
    from traditional NMC and nickel-rich materials.

- en: Battery scientists are optimistic that the new breed of batteries can overcome
    two key drawbacks of conventional lithium-ion. First, they say, nickel-rich cathodes
    will enable the battery industry to use less cobalt in the cathode. Second, solid-state
    chemistries will enable battery makers to use lithium metal in the anode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to reduce cobalt in the cathode is important because cobalt is scarce,
    expensive, and [often mined in countries with weak labor laws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/ev-cobalt-mines-congo/).
    And the ability to use lithium metal in the anode is important because it would
    boost energy density while promoting safety. Makers of liquid-based lithium-ion
    batteries currently don’t use lithium metal anodes due to fear of fires.

    could use lithium metal,” noted [Helena Braga](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=320005),
    an associate professor of engineering physics at the University of Porto, in Portugal,
    and a well-known researcher who worked with [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/goodenough/facts/)
    winner [John Goodenough](https://spectrum.ieee.org/john-goodenough-tribute) on
    solid-state batteries a decade ago. Braga said she is confident that the new chemistries
    will be ready soon, if they are not already.

    big manufacturing companies that make few public pronouncements, such as [LG Chem](https://www.lgchem.com/main/index)
    and [BYD](https://www.byd.com/us). Some of those companies may be farther along,
    but it’s hard to know because there is so little reliable information.
