    HelloFresh £140,000 for a campaign of 79 million spam emails and 1 million spam
    texts over a seven-month period](/action-weve-taken/enforcement/grocery-delivery-e-services-uk-ltd-ta-hellofresh/

- en: The marketing messages were sent based on an opt-in statement which did not
    make any reference to the sending of marketing via text. Whilst there was a reference
    to marketing via email, this was included in an age confirmation statement which
    was likely to unfairly incentivise customers to agree.

    to be used for marketing purposes for up to 24 months after cancelling their subscriptions.

- en: An investigation by the ICO began in March 2022 following complaints made directly
    to the regulator, as well as to the 7726 spam message reporting service. As part
    of this investigation, it was also discovered that the company continued to contact
    some individuals even after they had requested this to stop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following the investigation, we found that the company (Grocery Delivery E-Services
    UK Limited) contravened regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications
    Regulations 2003 and it has now been served with a fine of £140,000.

    weren’t told exactly what they’d be opting into, nor was it clear how to opt out.
    From there, they were hit with a barrage of marketing texts they didn't want or
    expect, and in some cases, even when they told HelloFresh to stop, the deluge
    continued.

    messages comprised of 79,779,279 emails and 1,113,734 SMS messages received by
    subscribers. The Commissioner found that HelloFresh transmitted those messages
    contrary to Regulation 22 of PECR.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The consent statement for these messages did not meet the requirement that it
    be “specific” and “informed”, as it did not mention SMS, was unclear and bundled
    with other aspects, and did not highlight that customers would receive messages
    for 24 months after they cancelled their HelloFresh subscription.
