    most banal expressions have a slightly different sense, issuing from a network
    of attitudes and ideas unique to each language. Switching between languages, we
    may feel as if we are stepping from one world into another. Each language seemingly
    compels us to talk in a certain way and to see things from a particular perspective.

    or even dictate specific patterns of thought to its speakers?'

    of a language, and it is difficult to say.’ What we *can* say is that the genius
    of a language was understood as representing its distinct character, the *je ne*

    of human language in animal cries, Herder insisted that there is a difference
    in kind between human and animal communication. Human language, so Herder argued,
    rests on the irreducible human capacity for ‘reflection’ (*Besonnenheit*), our
    ability to recognise and think about our own thoughts. In coining our words, we
    reflect on the properties of the things they name, and choose the most salient
    of these. Different peoples will have focused on different properties, with the
    result that each language with its characteristic forms will encapsulate a slightly
    different perspective on the world. As languages are passed on from generation
    to generation, the differences between them accumulate, making the languages and
    the worldviews they contain more and more distinct. In order to understand the
    unique perspective of each language, we must trace the forms of words back to
    their etymological origins.

    expertly into a broader account of language and literature by Wilhelm von Humboldt

    that language not only reflects a particular worldview but is actively involved
    in shaping it: ‘Language,’ he wrote , ‘is the forming organ of thought.’ The relationship
    he envisaged, however, was not one-way but dialectic. Between language and thought
    there inheres an endless feedback loop: our thoughts shape our words, and our
    words shape our thoughts. His account was not restricted to individual words –
    more important were the grammatical structures exhibited in the languages of the
    world. But even the study of grammar was only a preliminary to the real task,
    according to Humboldt. Grammar and vocabulary merely represent the ‘dead skeleton’
    of a language. To capture its character, to see its ‘living structure’, we must

    comparative-historical grammar became established as the premier field of linguistics.
    This is the approach that carefully compares words and grammatical forms across
    languages in order to chart their historical changes and identify their putative
    genealogical relations. Comparative-historical linguistics tells us, for example,
    that French, Italian and Spanish are all descended from Latin; that Hindi-Urdu,

    forms preferred to describe the historical transmutations they studied in terms
    of ‘sound laws’. Sound laws are mere statements of fact, that a sound attested
    in a certain phonetic environment in a parent language changes into other sounds
    in its descendants. Such accounts avoid invoking any hidden, underlying explanatory
    principles. Most comparative-historical grammarians believed that, for linguistics
    to be considered a serious science, it must limit itself to solid, objectively
    observable data. Uncovering the inner life of languages, capturing their characters

    tempered by a belief in the at least partial autonomy of linguistic form. On Sapir’s

    for patterning on the level of grammatical formation’, both of which ‘operate
    as such, regardless of the need for expressing particular concepts or of giving

    their private domain, an object they could investigate independently of any broader

    a distinction between *la langue* (language) and *la parole* (speech), a distinction
    that has become fundamental to much subsequent linguistic scholarship. *La* *langue*
    is the abstract, self-contained system of each language, while *la parole* is
    the use of *la langue* to create actual utterances. Linguists, argued Saussure,
    should describe the properties of each *langue* without worrying about how it
    is instantiated in the minds and mouths of speakers. These are problems for the
    neighbouring sciences of psychology, physiology and physics. Sapir’s avowal of
    the formal autonomy of languages can be understood as part of this trend, even
    though at the same time he clearly did not wish to entirely relinquish his Humboldtian
    heritage, with its psychological and anthropological concerns.

  zh: 把语言形式视为某种程度上的自主性，是19世纪比较历史语法学家关于音变定律的假设的内在含义。在20世纪，许多语言学家明确提出了把语言结构剥离出来，作为他们的私人领域，一个他们可以独立研究的对象，不受认知或语音的生产和接收的更广泛问题的影响。在这些年里，日内瓦语言学家费迪南德·德·索绪尔（1857-1913）引入了*la
    langue*（语言）和*la parole*（言语）的区别，这一区别成为了后来许多语言学研究的基础。*La* *langue*是每种语言的抽象、自包含系统，而*la
    parole*是使用*la langue*来创建实际话语。索绪尔认为，语言学家应该描述每种*langue*的属性，而不必担心它如何在说话者的头脑和口腔中实现。这些问题是邻近的心理学、生理学和物理学的科学问题。萨皮尔对语言的形式自主性的宣称可以理解为这一趋势的一部分，尽管与此同时，他显然并不希望完全放弃他的洪堡传统，其中包括心理学和人类学方面的关注。
