- en: Physicist Richard Feynman wondered what would happen if an S-shaped lawn sprinkler,
    which rotates as water squirts out, were placed underwater and had its flow direction
    reversed, so that it sucked water in. Which direction would it rotate? Experiments
    have given conflicting answers, but now researchers have provided what appears
    to be a definitive resolution [[1](#c1)]. When sucking water in, the sprinkler
    reverses its rotational direction, and the motion is unsteady and much slower.
    The explanation involves the details of fluid flow in the sprinkler geometry.

    in his 1985 book, *Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman*. “The trouble was, some
    guy would think it was perfectly clear [that the rotation would be] one way, and
    another guy would think it was perfectly clear the other way.” Since then, some
    experiments have shown steady reverse rotation [[2](#c2), [3](#c3)], some showed
    only transient rotation [[4](#c4)–[6](#c6)], and some situations led to unsteady
    rotation that changed direction [[3](#c3)] or proceeded in a direction that depended
    on the experimental geometry [[4](#c4)–[6](#c6)].

- en: Applied mathematician Leif Ristroph of New York University and his colleagues
    set out to resolve the matter, which meant taking careful account of all of the
    confounding factors. “As we worked on this problem, we got pulled in deeper and
    deeper and had to develop methods at every step,” says Ristroph.

- en: To get to the heart of Feynman’s challenge, the sprinkler must be able to rotate
    with as little friction as possible, which was a major challenge for previous
    experiments. The team devised a system in which the rotating hub containing the
    submerged S-shaped arms floats freely in a tank of water. They could reverse the
    flow direction by raising or lowering a side tank connected by a siphon tube to
    the center of the hub.

- en: Given previous arguments about whether any motion was truly a steady state or
    just transient, the researchers needed to run the experiment for long times (several
    hours). These long time frames also allowed them to measure the motions with high
    accuracy. To understand the results theoretically, they obtained detailed maps
    of the fluid flow patterns using colored dyes and suspended microparticles that
    scatter laser light.

- en: '**×** **Ristroph and colleagues concluded that both the forward and the reverse
    sprinklers are driven by jet propulsion. Ristroph compares the forward case to
    a rotational version of a rocket with S-shaped thrusters. But the reverse case
    isn’t simply a time-reversed version: as water is sucked into the arms, the flow
    pattern is quite different. Although this flow drives reverse rotation, the motion
    is not steady but shows constant fluctuations in velocity. The overall average
    rate of rotation is about 50 times slower than when water flows outward.'

- en: In this “reverse flow” case, it is rather surprising that a rocket-like propulsion
    still operates at all, since at first glance the jets are just directed at the
    center of the device and don’t generate any net torque. But the researchers found
    that the jets aren’t directed exactly at the center because of distortion of the
    flow as it passes through the curved arms. As the water flows around the bends
    in the arms, it is slung outward by centrifugal force, which gives rise to asymmetric
    flow profiles. “This is what makes the reverse case hard and subtle,” says Ristroph,
    “since one cannot easily infer what will happen based on the forward case.” Nonetheless,
    the flow pattern seen experimentally closely matched that predicted by the team’s
    mathematical model.

    sprinkler problem directly with precision experiments,” says fluid dynamicist
    John Bush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The carefully designed
    geometry and low friction, he says, help to pin down the mechanisms involved.

- en: Mechanical engineer Michael Païdoussis of McGill University in Canada, who has
    previously conducted experiments on the Feynman sprinkler problem, agrees that
    the reverse rotation is confirmed by these experiments. “The degree of agreement
    between the experiment and model results is quite remarkable,” he adds.

- en: It might seem that reversing a sprinkler is not of much practical interest,
    admits Ristroph, “since we don’t need to ‘unwater’ our lawns.” But he says that
    there are applications in fluid mechanics in which it is important to be able
    to precisely control flows ejected from devices and to understand how this process
    modifies the forces they experience, for example, in technologies that harvest
    energy from flowing air or water.
