    are in 85 unique systems – one planet per star,” Hawthorn explained. The diversity
    of these exoplanets is notable, with some potentially rocky and others gaseous.
    The habitability of these planets remains a subject of further research.

    learn more about their exact orbital periods, whether or not they have moons,
    and what exactly they are made of,” Hawthorn said.

    700 days, indicating cooler temperatures compared to most TESS-observed exoplanets,
    which have much shorter orbital periods.

    the planets – a planet is considered to be ‘confirmed’ when it has a mass (we

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope for NASA’s
    Explorer program, designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method.
    Launched on April 18, 2018, TESS is intended to survey the brightest stars near
    the Earth for periodic dips in brightness caused by planetary transits.

    that covered by the Kepler mission. It surveys different sectors of the sky for
    about 27 days each, covering 85% of the sky over two years.

- en: The mission’s primary goal is to identify planets ranging from Earth-sized to
    gas giants, orbiting a wide range of stellar types and orbital distances. The
    key focus is on small planets near bright stars, as these are the easiest targets
    for detailed follow-up studies.

    and space-based telescopes. These observations can provide detailed information
    about the planets’ masses, sizes, densities, and atmospheric properties.
