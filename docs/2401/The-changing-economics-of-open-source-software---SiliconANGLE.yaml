  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But unlike earlier changes brought about by corporate acquisitions, this time
    it’s thanks to the growing series of tech layoffs. These could lead to many projects
    being crippled because their principals are now unemployed or will get new jobs
    in less open-favorable companies. The layoffs will certainly change the balance
    of power between large and small software vendors, and between free and commercial
    software versions, and the role played by OSS in enterprise software applications
    could change.

- en: Most analysts agree that open source has become firmly planted into commercial
    software development, both from the perspective of the vendors who contribute
    their code back to the world as well as for those end-users who develop applications
    built around open-source projects.

- en: This position has further solidified thanks to the major boost from generative
    artificial intelligence. That’s because of numerous AI-related projects that grew
    exponentially in the past year as developers rushed to implement its routines
    into their code. AI has brought hundreds of developers into the OSS fold because
    so much of its code uses various OSS projects, such as PyTorch which began under
    Meta Platforms Inc. and became its own OSS juggernaut with more than 600,000 code
    repositories.

- en: Back in 2009 to 2010, the first major series of changes to OSS came about thanks
    to Oracle acquiring Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion. At the time there was much
    pearl-clutching about the anticompetitive underpinnings, with the European approval
    held up. Thousands of Sun employees were terminated along the way.

    the home to the principals behind Java, XML, JRuby and other tools. (They all
    eventually left Oracle, along with Sun’s chief executive, who was one of the first
    people to resign via a haiku in a tweet.)

    at Rapid7, 16% at Dropbox, 5% at Atlassian, 5% at VMware, 5% at Dell and 8% at
    NetApp. Add to that several rounds of layoffs at Spotify, TikTok owner ByteDance,
    Amazon.com, Twilio, LinkedIn, SecureWorks, Microsoft, Meta and Twitter, which
    collectively added tens of thousands to the unemployment lines.

  zh: Linux Foundation的角色
- en: Perhaps the biggest center of gravity for open source is the Linux Foundation,
    which operates a multimillion-dollar, multimodal organization that is focused
    on open-source support. There are close to 1,000 different software projects under
    its umbrella. It depends on hundreds of company members that make annual contributions,
    along with dozens of other providers that donate at higher funding levels, such
    as Microsoft, Google and Facebook.

  zh: 也许开源最大的重心在于Linux Foundation，该基金会运营着一个专注于开源支持的价值数百万美元的多模态组织。在其旗下有近1000个不同的软件项目。它依赖于数百家公司成员每年的捐款，以及数十家其他提供商以更高的资金水平捐款，如微软、谷歌和Facebook。
- en: But money is only one point of view. The foundation has had a rocky year itself,
    laying off numerous employees. Part of that was in anticipation of reduced support
    from the tech companies that shed staff, many of which were high-level foundation
    supporters. For example, VMware, a platinum member, has pulled its support entirely,
    along with several other gold-level sponsors.

  zh: 但金钱只是一种观点。该基金会本身度过了一个艰难的一年，裁员众多。部分原因是预期到来自于裁员的科技公司减少支持，其中许多公司是高级别的基金会支持者。例如，白金会员VMware已经完全撤回了支持，以及其他几个金牌赞助商。
- en: “This was a shock to the system,” Linux Foundation Senior Vice President Mike
    Dolan told SiliconANGLE. “We have had to make some adjustments because so many
    open-systems engineers were let go.” Dolan said there are more than 80 funding
    initiatives that operate independently under the foundation’s umbrella, such as
    the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the PyTorch Foundation, the Hyperledger
    Foundation and the Overture Maps Foundation.

  zh: “这对系统来说是个冲击，”Linux Foundation的高级副总裁Mike Dolan告诉SiliconANGLE。“由于很多开放系统工程师被解雇，我们不得不进行一些调整。”Dolan说，有80多个资金计划在基金会的旗下独立运作，如Cloud
    Native Computing Foundation、PyTorch Foundation、Hyperledger Foundation和Overture
    Maps Foundation。
- en: “The problem now is that especially in the operating system and financial services
    markets, there is a large uptake in consumption of open-source code, but the contributions
    back to the community and commitments to fixing code is lacking,” said Jason Perlow,
    a longtime OSS advocate who was one of those laid off this month at the foundation.
    He told SiliconANGLE that what is missing is what’s called an “open source program
    office, which is used to cultivate and track an organization’s OSS code and coordinate
    changes.”

  zh: “目前的问题是，特别是在操作系统和金融服务市场，开源代码的消耗量大幅增加，但回馈社区的贡献和修复代码的承诺不足，”长期以来一直是OSS倡导者之一的Jason
    Perlow在本月被该基金会解雇之一后说道。他告诉SiliconANGLE，缺少的是所谓的“开源项目办公室”，这个办公室用于培育和跟踪组织的OSS代码并协调变更。
- en: Red Hat, long a poster child for OSS, has lately seen a reduced effort with
    contributing its code, according to Perlow. Much of this could be caused by funding
    pressures to operate these offices, especially as the software industry shrinks.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 根据Perlow的说法，长期以来一直是OSS的标志性企业Red Hat最近在贡献其代码方面的努力有所减少。其中许多原因可能是由于运营这些办公室的资金压力，特别是在软件行业收缩的情况下。

    innovation can’t happen without collaboration,” the foundation’s year-end report
    says. Several of its events and efforts brought together a variety of legal, engineering
    and other technologists to further OSS goals. Dolan mentioned a [HyperLedger project
    called Circulor](https://www.hyperledger.org/case-studies/materials-traceability-leader-circulor-expands-hyperledger-fabric-based-solution-to-underpin-digital-battery-passports)
    that brought together different  battery vendors to work on a common set of standards.

- en: But it isn’t all singing kumbaya around the campfire. In 2023, there were two
    other events that shook the OSS foundational tenets, both involving conflicts
    over licensing. Meta released the latest version of its Llama large language model
    as OSS, as long as it wasn’t heavily used by an enterprise, in which case [companies
    would have to pay a fee to license its use.](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2023/07/19/is-llama-2-open-source-no-and-perhaps-we-need-a-new-definition-of-open/)
    And HashiCorp Inc. changed its licensing terms for Terraform from OSS to fee-based.

  zh: 但并不是所有事情都是在篝火旁唱着kumbaya。在2023年，有两件事件动摇了OSS的基本原则，都涉及到许可冲突。Meta发布了其Llama大型语言模型的最新版本作为OSS，只要它没有被企业大量使用，否则[公司将不得不支付使用费用的许可费。](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2023/07/19/is-llama-2-open-source-no-and-perhaps-we-need-a-new-definition-of-open/)而HashiCorp
    Inc.将其Terraform的许可条款从OSS改为了收费制。
- en: Despite or perhaps as a result of its own layoffs, Microsoft has moved into
    a more critical role for OSS in the past year. It continues to extend its Azure
    cloud footprint using a wide variety of OSS technologies, including Linux.

- en: “Microsoft has become the best OSS citizen in terms of engineering talent and
    funding,” Perlow said. “More than 40% of Azure are running Linux and OSS workloads,
    and most of its infrastructure doesn’t have anything to do with Microsoft software
    at all.”

    staffing setbacks in 2024 and beyond. But clearly it will have some major changes
    ahead.
