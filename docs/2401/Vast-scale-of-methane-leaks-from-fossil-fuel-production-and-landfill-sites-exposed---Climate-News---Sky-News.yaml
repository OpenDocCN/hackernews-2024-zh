    has been exposed by analysis carried out exclusively for Sky News.

- en: Around 1,300 "super-emitters" of the potent greenhouse gas have been identified
    so far in 2023 by the monitoring company Kayrros, which uses satellites to detect
    plumes of the gas.

    coal mines and landfill sites.

    in Turkmenistan, where a leak from one facility is estimated to have peaked at
    333 tonnes per hour in August.

    gas emissions from a car driving around 38,000 miles.

    21 and 56 tonnes of the methane every hour for 153 days between June and November.

    homes.

    it acts as a heat "bomb" in the atmosphere.

    Because it only persists in the atmosphere for around a decade rather than several
    centuries, as in the case of carbon dioxide, turning off the tap on emissions
    would have a rapid impact.
