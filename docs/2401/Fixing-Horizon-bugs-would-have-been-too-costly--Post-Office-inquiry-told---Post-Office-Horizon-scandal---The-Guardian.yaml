    technical tasks relating to the shift from the Post Office’s use of paper-based
    accounting methods to the automated Horizon IT system.

    year, and has gained greater public attention since the ITV drama Mr Bates vs
    the Post Office aired earlier this month. The UK business minister, Kemi Badenoch,
    has [written to Fujitsu](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/17/post-office-it-scandal-kemi-badenoch-fujistu-compensation)

    automatically summarises a post office’s transactions at around 7pm daily, resulted
    in users working at the same time having balancing issues.

    Barnes said was referred to as “silent failure”.

    [to Fujitsu] in the event log and to diagnosticians. The operator at the Post
    Office branch would not know anything had gone wrong.”

    did when it became “a higher priority with the [Post Office],” according to an
    internal Fujitsu email, when it appears to have emerged that the issue affected
    195 branches.

    a problem that could easily be caused by another system at any time of day. In
    retrospect, error handling should have been tightened generally.”

    opportunity to address deficient coding practices that led to [other] silent failures”,
    which resulted in subpostmasters being wrongfully prosecuted.

    said Barnes at the inquiry. “The better thing to do is to make sure the [Horizon
    Online] software works. It would have just been too expensive to do a thorough
    job at that stage. It would have been uneconomic. To comprehensively rewrite the
    error handling would be a massive job. It would be extremely expensive.”

    Penny Thomas, a manager in Fujitsu’s fraud and litigation office, after up to
    a third of entries proved to be duplicates.

    to be brought into doubt if duplicate transactions are spotted,” Barnes warned

    cases in the pipeline and it is imperative that we provide sound, accurate records.”

    possibility of audit transactions being missed from spreadsheets due to a bug

    2014.
