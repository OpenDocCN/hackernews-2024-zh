    financial holdings and expenditures. The book makes it clear how little regard

    of time to reflect and rewrite — there is a missing mood of introspection to his

    pressed Sam on how he reached his probabilistic claims. When Sam asserts that
    the $4 million worth of Ripple that went missing in the early days of Alameda
    had an “80 percent chance” of eventually turning up, Lewis asks no further questions.

    small changes in the probability of global catastrophe (“No one actually knows
    what the odds of any of these things are,” Lewis writes), so these projects often
    had effects of unclear size and sign. Furthermore, many of the projects, such

    expectancy investments — that is, likely money-losers — that were motivated by
    social or romantic considerations. For example, he kept his girlfriend Caroline
    in charge of Alameda Research despite the fact that, by her own admission, he
    disapproved of her job performance. His one childhood friend grew up to invent
    the video game *Storybook Brawl*; Sam then bought the game company, to achieve
    “[ethical integration](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-acquires-storybook-brawl-developer-good-luck-games-301507721.html)

    Sam had refused to share any equity with anyone. And now all these unprofitable
    effective altruist [employee]s were demanding to be paid millions to quit — and
    doing whatever they could to trash Sam’s reputation with the outside world until

    在本应该是合作的企业中，山姆拒绝与任何人分享任何股权。 现在，所有这些毫无盈利的有效利益雇员们要求支付数百万美元才能退出——并且他们竭尽所能地破坏山姆在外界的声誉，直到他们得到他们的钱。
- en: By adopting Nishad’s framing of loan-shark interest rates, Lewis paints a picture
    of the effective altruist investors as overly aggressive and greedy. But presenting
    these investments as extortionate loans ignores that typical hedge fund investors
    (structured as limited partnership interests) commonly receive rates of 80% of
    the profits.   Thus, the investors here in Alameda were getting less of the profits
    (50%, not 80%) and Alameda management was getting more (50%, not 20%) than in
    the typical private equity investment. There are important differences between
    debt and equity investments that make this 80% an imperfect comparison point — for
    example, interest on debt is owed regardless of fund performance, while carried
    interest is only applied to profits. Because debt can be structured to be equity-like,
    and equity can be structured to be debt-like, an exact comparison cannot be made
    without the details of these loans, which Lewis does not provide. Eliding the
    details of the specific debt structuring that early Alameda used and omitting
    to explain the usual fee structure for private equity investments allows Lewis
    to paint a very harsh picture of Alameda’s investors, and by contrast a much rosier
    picture of Nishad and Sam.

    因此，在阿拉米达这里的投资者获得的利润较少（50%，而不是80%），而阿拉米达管理层获得的更多（50%，而不是20%），这与典型的私募股权投资有重要差异。
    债务和股权投资之间存在重要的差异，这使得80%成为不完全的比较点，例如，无论基金绩效如何，债务利息都是应支付的，而分红利润只适用于利润。 因为债务可以构造得像股权一样，而股权也可以构造得像债务一样，所以没有提供这些贷款的详细信息，无法进行精确比较。
    遗漏早期阿拉米达使用的具体债务结构的细节，并且没有解释私募股权投资的通常费用结构，使刘易斯能够对阿拉米达的投资者们进行非常严厉的描述，相比之下对尼沙德和山姆则有了一个更加乐观的描述。

    100 美元。在某个时候，Sam 与另一名实习生“阿舍·梅尔曼”打赌当天实习生的最大损失金额，而 Sam 从中获利，因为该值超过了 65 美元。
- en: To drive up losses, Sam offered other interns $1 to engage in coin flips with
    him for nearly $100 each, maximizing how much of Asher’s money — and dignity — he
    could extract. He went through four such coin flips, winning the first three,
    such that those interns lost nearly $100 each and Asher owed Sam the maximum amount
    from their bet. Later, Sam got in trouble with his managers (“‘They said the second
    coin flip was already one too many,’ said Sam”), and concluded dismissively that
    Jane Street thought he should have been more sensitive to his fellow interns’

    100 美元，而 Asher 需要向 Sam 支付他们的赌注的最大金额。后来，Sam 因为他的经理们而陷入麻烦（“‘他们说第二次硬币翻转已经太多了，”Sam
    说道），并得出了不屑一顾的结论，认为简·斯特里特认为他应该更加关心他的同事实习生的情绪。
- en: But if you dig down into the math in the story, several of Sam’s coin flips
    actually turn out to have been negative expected value for him. After Sam’s first
    coin flip against another intern, the maximum intern loss of (approximately) $100
    had been achieved, and Sam’s additional flips wouldn’t have extracted more money
    from Asher — by then, he was just giving out a free $1 in expected value to other
    interns. While Lewis would have us see Sam as a nimble Bayesian, we see him spot

    如果仔细观察资金流动或者萨姆交易策略的预期价值，可能会注意到一些红旗，但是周围的社会和人际动态实在是更加吸引人。

  zh: 注意当你感到困惑时。 注意到那种困惑，并寻求答案。 如果你询问的人不知道答案，那就是你需要了解更多而不是更少的一个迹象。
- en: When there are ambiguities, push for specifics. Make the range of possible outcomes
    intelligible. If seeking clarification gets you fired, that’s evidence of rot
    underneath. In trader terms, this is called adverse selection — if your counterparty
    won’t specify a price within a broad range, the true price is more likely to be
    at the lower end of the range than at the higher end. If the underlying facts
    reflected well on them, they’d be more inclined to provide more information when
    you push for it. Get things in writing; ask for binding commitments, and don’t
    trust that other players in a zero-sum environment will have your best interests
    at heart.

  zh: 当存在歧义时，坚持要求具体情况。 让可能结果范围变得清晰。 如果寻求澄清会让你被解雇，那就是底部腐烂的证据。 以交易员的术语来说，这被称为逆向选择——如果你的交易对手不会在一个广泛范围内指定一个价格，那么真实价格更可能位于范围的较低端而不是较高端。
    如果底层事实对他们有利，他们就更倾向于在你推动下提供更多信息。 将事情写下来； 要求有约束力的承诺，并不要相信零和环境中的其他玩家会把你的最大利益放在心上。
- en: Get a pair of outside eyes — ones that aren’t subject to the same set of incentives
    that you are. If you can, get someone who does have experiences relevant to the
    situation at hand. Talk to people whose backgrounds, motivations, and ways of
    moving through the world are not highly correlated with your own. My Wall Street
    lawyer friend didn’t have precise probabilistic models, but he did have years
    of working on Bernie Madoff and other fraud lawsuits, and heuristics he’d developed
    about how fraud plays out.

  zh: 寻找一双外部眼睛——那些不受相同激励体系影响的人。 如果可能的话，找一个与手头情况相关经验的人。 与那些背景、动机和生活方式与你不高度相关的人交谈。 我的华尔街律师朋友没有精确的概率模型，但他在伯尼·麦道夫和其他欺诈诉讼案件上工作了多年，他对欺诈如何发生已经形成了启发式方法。
- en: External advisors, regulatory bodies, and even lay observers can offer perspectives
    that are not cloaked by the day-to-day incentives and tunnel-vision of a high-stakes,
    highly-cohesive work environment. I still remember a conversation with a homeless
    friend of mine whose immediate reaction to my work adventures in January 2022
    was, “Oh yeah, this is definitely fraud. There is no way these people are not
    committing fraud.”

  zh: 外部顾问、监管机构，甚至是普通观察者都可以提供不受日常激励和高度凝聚的工作环境所遮蔽的视角。我仍然记得我一个流浪朋友的一次谈话，他对我2022年1月的工作冒险的直接反应是：“哦，是的，这绝对是欺诈。这些人绝对在进行欺诈。”
- en: Put yourself in environments where the incentive gradient flows in a direction
    you endorse. The current will be stronger than your ability to row against it.

    you to be honest and scrupulous and just and kind.

- en: Finally, if you do manage to avoid getting caught in a moral morass, your work
    is not done. A mix of caution and luck helped me avoid playing a major role in
    the FTX story. But my own clean hands didn’t prevent harm from happening. We need
    structural supports and coordination mechanisms — laws, corporate controls, societal
    norms — to reduce harm. As individuals, we have power to influence those laws,
    controls, and norms. We can reward transparency and truth seeking, call for expert
    oversight for actions with elusive and high variance outcomes, and cultivate reverence
    for institutional and inherited wisdom.

  zh: 最后，如果你确实设法避免陷入道德泥沼，你的工作并没有完成。谨慎和运气的结合帮助我避免在FTX故事中扮演重要角色。但是我的清白并没有阻止伤害发生。我们需要结构性支持和协调机制——法律、公司控制、社会规范——来减少伤害。作为个体，我们有能力影响这些法律、控制和规范。我们可以奖励透明度和寻求真相，呼吁对具有难以捉摸和高方差结果的行动进行专家监督，并培养对制度和传承智慧的尊重。
- en: Some of the mistakes of the FTX story are epistemic mistakes, failures of reasoning
    due to insufficient background and clarity. Some are ethical mistakes, willingness
    to take on risks to others of unknown size and probability. Some are mistakes
    of agency and access, where those who might have caught and reported problems
    were kept far away from the problems and thus never had the power to report. None
    of them happen in a vacuum. Our epistemics, incentives, and access all influence
    one another, and those influences are often invisible to us. Mistakes are adaptive,
    fulfill our self interest, and get made most consequentially by those least likely
    to interrogate them.

  zh: FTX故事中的一些错误是认识论上的错误，是由于背景知识和清晰度不足而导致的推理失败。有些是道德上的错误，愿意为了他人未知大小和概率的风险。有些是代理和获取方面的错误，可能本可以发现并报告问题的人被远远地排除在问题之外，因此从未有权力报告。这些错误都不是孤立发生的。我们的认知、激励和获取都相互影响，而这些影响对我们通常是看不见的。错误是适应性的，满足我们的自身利益，并且由那些最不可能质疑它们的人最重要地制造。
