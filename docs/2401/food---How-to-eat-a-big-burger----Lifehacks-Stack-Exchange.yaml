    and eat their enormous ***Monster Burgers***.

    of the word etiquette. Nevertheless, this is what I find helpful when eating burgers
    that only the Flintstones can truly enjoy.

- en: Before cutting the burger in half, I pierce burger with six (6) toothpicks as
    well as squish it to accommodate my mouth and then I cut the sandwich in half.
    Make sure that the tomatoes are well pierced or they will make a quick dash to
    freedom when eating your meal.

- en: As I eat my hamburger, I remove the toothpicks when needed in order to enjoy
    my food. Occasionally I will have to remove a toothpick and place it in another
    spot in the hopes of not letting this monstrosity win and spilling onto the plate
    or even worse me.

    job at not being messy.

    eating the **Monster Burger** in this fashion.
