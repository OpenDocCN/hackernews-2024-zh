- en: In autumn 1837 Captain Jonathan Childe, an officer in the 12th Lancers, became
    convinced that the young Queen Victoria had become romantically attached to him.
    That a handsome, well-born man might have caught the queen’s eye was not impossible.
    She was very young, of an amorous nature and impressed by manly men. Instead of
    simply taking the compliment, Childe wrote her a series of passionate love letters.
    And then he would not, or could not, stop writing.

  zh: 在1837年秋天，第12兰开夏轻骑兵团的军官乔纳森·钱德尔上尉相信年轻的维多利亚女王已经对他产生了浪漫情感。一个英俊、出身良好的男人吸引了女王的注意并不是不可能的。她非常年轻，性情多情，对阳刚之气的男人留下了深刻印象。钱德尔没有简单地接受这份恭维，而是给她写了一系列充满激情的情书。然后他就不肯，或者说不能，停止写作。
- en: Victoria might have been young and amorous, but she was also the queen of England.
    Any idea of a relationship or secret communication was nonsensical. Polite, and
    then insistent, requests for Childe to stop writing followed. His ‘offensive’
    letters continued. Pressure from the palace and the army led Childe’s father to
    have him examined by a team of medical doctors to see if his obsession was clinical.
    After attempts at supervision and distraction failed, he was sent to a private
    asylum outside Dublin in 1842.

  zh: 维多利亚可能年轻且多情，但她也是英格兰女王。任何关系或秘密通讯的想法都是荒谬的。对于钱德尔停止写作的礼貌请求，接着是坚决的请求。他的“冒犯性”信件继续。来自宫廷和军队的压力使钱德尔的父亲让一队医生对他进行检查，看看他的迷恋是否临床性质。在监督和转移尝试失败后，他于1842年被送往都柏林外的一家私人精神病院。
