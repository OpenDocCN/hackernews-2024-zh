The notice comes ahead of potential official approval on Wednesday from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Approval of bitcoin ETFs would broaden bitcoin access to more investors, who wouldn't have to go to a crypto exchange, potentially providing an easier way to buy the world's largest digital asset.
