`Wise is a pitch perfect challenger brand, making a villain out of the hidden fees banks charge on international transfers and rallying customers around a mission to capture 5% market share of a $22T industry`

Hello!

Today‚Äôs brand is [Wise](https://wise.com/us/account/), a founder-led, bankless currency exchange dedicated to eliminating the bloated fees charged by banks on international money transfers.

Shoutout to [Troy](https://twitter.com/troyassoignon) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/Ben_Phillips) who both suggested this brand! üôè

Never had to transfer money internationally? Count yourself #blessed.

Wise‚Äôs founders, two Estonian blokes, weren‚Äôt down with the hidden fees incurred by banks and money transfer services and built a product that slashed the hidden fees in order to let people keep more of their money. But how do you fundamentally change a category for the better, while making people aware of a problem they don‚Äôt even know they have? Wise‚Äôs highlights reel includes:

Turns out, *not* ripping people off is good business!

Wise is a *masterclass* in building a customer centric culture, a 10x product and mission driven brand marketing: a cocktail for success, but not for the faint of heart!

Let‚Äôs follow the money üí∞

Wise is bullish on what‚Äôs wrong with the world: hidden fees.

So bullish that they built a product that was 10X faster and cheaper than anything on the market.

Founder-led companies are legendary at making products that are category defining. [Bain & Company research shows](https://hbr.org/2016/03/founder-led-companies-outperform-the-rest-heres-why) that disproportionately, founder led businesses are most successful at maintaining profitable growth over the long term.

Brands that successfully reimagine the way the world works most often start with an *extraordinarily clear purpose*. Unlike fonts, colors, or even CEOs, which all come and go, purpose is a powerful driver for behavior change from the inside out.

Wise‚Äôs written manifesto is a stellar example of clear purposeüëá But **Wise didn‚Äôt even have their mission written down until 5 years in**.

What they did was **create an environment where a mission could take root**: a customer centric environment.

And what Wise heard from customers in the early days? They didn‚Äôt even know there was a problem!

That gave Wise clear direction for their marketing. They needed to **make people aware of the problem**, **reflect what customers actually care about** ***while delivering a meaningfully better product**. And that is the recipe for advocacy*.

The simple, written manifesto below was a growth driver for Wise, thanks to customers forwarding it to their friends. Not just a clever bit of copy, it‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg of a customer centric culture.

Remember: Stories people *want* to tell spread faster than anything on the planet.

Phoar, right?! Three cheers for * *checks notes* * money transfer services?

You betcha. But having a worthy mission alone isn‚Äôt enough: Wise needed to scale the mission from the few to the many.

Wise‚Äôs wisest move: using existing customers to get ***more*** customers.

Too many early stage start ups over complicate looking for their customers and writing set in stone plans rather than following the early energy of where your best and most enthusiastic customers are coming from.

This of course is the hard part: far too many companies have no idea who their real customer is.

The third move Wise made was marketing their mission, not just their product.

The holy grail of marketing is word of mouth advertising. The problem is that few businesses do anything that‚Äôs ***actually*** worth talking about.

**People buy on emotional reasons, but justify purchases with logic**. Wise has both:

1.  Rational - Faster & cheaper product than the competition

2.  Emotional - Mission

Wise‚Äôs marketing mix includes PR, paid social, SEO, affiliate and partnership marketing, but while optimizing channels will grow Wise‚Äôs user base, it won‚Äôt ***step change growth***. Marketing their mission does.

Wise creates high visibility stunts that look more like community organizing than marketing: but here‚Äôs the most important part. Wise actually *invites* their customers to help be part of the change.

They have:

How do you get people to pay attention to what money is doing? Don‚Äôt behave like a financial services company.

Wise ran a petition to collect signatures from customers to expose hidden banking fees and get the government to [crack down on hidden fees](https://wise.com/gb/blog/join-our-campaign-to-stophiddenfees). They launched a ‚Äò[Stop the Exchange Rate Ripoff Report](https://wise.com/us/blog/stop-the-exchange-rate-ripoff-report)‚Äô, commissioned research on the hidden fees, and publicized the hidden fees to great effect to users, even banding together with Monzo and Revolut to [call for reform collectively on hidden fees](https://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/Monzo_Revolut_Wise_Demand_Urgent_Review_Of_Hidden_International_Fees.php).

Finally, because what was 2010 without a flashmob, Wise got 100 people to ‚Äòexpose‚Äô hidden fees by stripping down in front of major London landmarks, staging similar stunts in Paris, Barcelona, New York and Toronto.

Community organizing 101: share a big mission, then enlist people with small asks to help you achieve it.

Wanna be like Wise?

No brand strategy is one-size fits all or copy paste, but what you will never go wrong with is ***listening to your customers.*** Here‚Äôs 3 takeaways any company can benefit from:

*   **Talk üëè to üëè your üëè customer.** When was the last time you spoke to a customer? If it‚Äôs been more than a month, it‚Äôs been too long. Take calls, make them, open source NPS reviews and feed them into an open Slack channel. Make your customers visible within your organization.

*   **Distill what you hear and identify a common enemy.** Gather a few folks who talk to customers regularly. Pool reviews, feedback, complaints. Distill it into your mission - and common enemy.

*   **Send up marketing test balloons.** Post 3-5 different ideas across organic social media. Pick the one that gets the most signal and then double down on it. Bonus points if you can find ways to allow people to participate in the campaign.
