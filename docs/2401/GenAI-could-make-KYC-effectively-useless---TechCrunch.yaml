    fintech startups and banks verify the identity of their customers. Not uncommonly,
    KYC authentication involves “ID images,” or cross-checked selfies used to confirm
    a person is who they say they are. Wise, Revolut and cryptocurrency platforms
    Gemini and LiteBit are among those relying on ID images for security onboarding.

- en: Viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit show how, leveraging open source
    and off-the-shelf software, an attacker could download a selfie of a person, edit
    it with generative AI tools and use the manipulated ID image to pass a KYC test.
    There’s no evidence that GenAI tools have been used to fool a real KYC system
    — yet. But the ease with which relatively convincing deepfaked ID images is cause
    for alarm.

- en: In a typical KYC ID image authentication, a customer uploads a picture of themselves
    holding an ID document — a passport or driver’s license, for example — that only
    they could possess. A person — or an algorithm — cross-references the image with
    documents and selfies on file to (hopefully) foil impersonation attempts.

    forged IDs and selfies for years. But GenAI opens up a range of new possibilities.

- en: '[Tutorials online](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/consistent-face/#Software)
    show how Stable Diffusion, a free, open source image generator, can be used to
    create synthetic renderings of a person against any desired backdrop (e.g., a
    living room). With a little trial and error, an attacker can tweak the renderings
    to show the target appearing to hold an ID document. At that point, the attacker
    can use any image editor to insert a real or fake document into the deepfaked
    person’s hands.'

    tools and extensions and procuring around a dozen images of the target. A Reddit
    user going by the username _harsh_, who’s published a workflow for creating deepfake
    ID selfies, told TechCrunch that it takes around one to two days to make a convincing
    image.

    images with realistic lighting, shadows and environments *used* to require somewhat
    advanced knowledge of photo editing software. That’s not necessarily the case
    now.

- en: Feeding deepfaked KYC images to an app is even easier than creating them. Android
    apps running on a desktop emulator like BlueStacks can be tricked into accepting
    deepfaked images instead of a live camera feed, while apps on the web can be foiled
    by software that lets users turn any image or video source into a virtual webcam.

- en: Some apps and platforms implement “liveness” checks as additional security to
    verify identity. Typically, they involve having a user take a short video of themselves
    turning their head, blinking their eyes or demonstrating in some other way that
    they’re indeed a real person.

- en: Early last year, Jimmy Su, the chief security officer for cryptocurrency exchange
    Binance, [told](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-rise-in-deepfake-customer-checks-verification)
    Cointelegraph that deepfake tools today are sufficient to pass liveness checks,
    even those that require users to perform actions like head turns in real time.

- en: The takeaway is that KYC, which was already hit or miss, could soon become effectively
    useless as a security measure. Su, for one, doesn’t believe deepfaked images and
    video have reached the point where they can fool human reviewers. But it might
    only be a matter of time before that changes.
