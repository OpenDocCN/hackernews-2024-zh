    for permission to ignore a shareholder resolution at its next annual meeting.
    The resolution was proposed by [Arjuna Capital](https://arjuna-capital.com) and
    [Follow This](https://www.follow-this.org), two activist investors that are seeking
    to compel Exxon to rein in its vast carbon emissions.

    they are investing by constraining and micromanaging ExxonMobil’s ordinary business
    operations.

    that shareholder value is a subjective opinion. If the world really is moving

    and dump the pollution into the atmosphere?'

    by carbon capture and storage and negative emission technologies (such as direct
    air capture) and their potential impact in reducing GHG emissions at scale, which
    are considered essential to achieve a net-zero outcome for society.

    on fire and then capture the pollution. Problem is, they don’t. Carbon capture
    is niche; it’s so small that I couldn’t find statistics on how much carbon was
    captured last year. Suffice it to say, it’s probably a very, very small portion
    of Exxon’s total carbon pollution.

    proposals in previous years asking Exxon to address its carbon pollution, both

    quickly and quietly.

    that would make it harder for shareholders to make proposals. After all, that’s

    a record of issuing rulings friendly to businesses.

    comes to those who are concerned about the company’s carbon pollution. Yet ironically,
    by filing this lawsuit, it has brought even more attention upon itself than a
    voted-down shareholder proposal would. Even before the judge has issued a ruling,
    Arjuna and Follow This have won the first round.
