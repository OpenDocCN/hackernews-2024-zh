    convey correct information on the newly emerging virus. On January 14, 2020 [the
    World Health Organization (WHO) posted](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152)
    on its official twitter (currently X) account “Preliminary investigations conducted
    by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission
    of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.” On February
    2, 2020 [the WHO posted](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1223659708072038400) on
    twitter “Asymptomatic #2019nCoV infection may be rare, and transmission from an
    asymptomatic person is very rare with other coronaviruses, as we have seen with
    MERS. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver
    of transmission.” These assertions were eventually contradicted by later findings.
    While these errors may not have stemmed from malintent, it remains uncertain whether
    future public health communications will adapt or change in response to these
    missteps.'

    the United States (US) House had a two-day transcribed interview with Anthony
    Fauci, who is the former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
    Diseases (NIAID). According to [the testimony takeaways](https://twitter.com/COVIDSelect/status/1745048322618904738)
    provided by the Select Subcommittee, Fauci acknowledged that the lab-leak hypothesis
    is not a conspiracy theory. On January 14, the Select Subcommittee [released the
    information](https://twitter.com/COVIDSelect/status/1746198369070932285) that
    Francis Collins, the former Director of the National Institute of Health (NIH),
    agreed with Dr. Fauci’s concession that the COVID-19 lab-leak hypothesis is not
    a conspiracy theory. On January 18, [the U.S. Right to Know released](https://usrtk.org/covid-19-origins/scientists-proposed-making-viruses-with-unique-features-of-sars-cov-2-in-wuhan/)
    an early draft of US-China research grant proposal called “DEFUSE” obtained through
    the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), where a detailed blueprint to synthesize
    a SARS-CoV-2-like virus is included. Some scientists evaluate this document as
    a smoking gun of the lab-leak hypothesis.

    came from natural spill-over or accidental lab-leak. As early as in February,
    2020, [a statement by 27 researchers](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext)
    was published in the Lancet, claiming “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy
    theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” However, a
    great amount of evidence suggests that virologists knew that the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
    which caused COVID-19, included genomic features that natural viruses do not have
    in the very early days of the pandemic.

    on January 31, 2020, which has been made public through a FOIA request, Kristian
    Andersen wrote “The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part
    of the genome (<0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to
    see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.” The features he
    noticed are supposed to be [the receptor binding domain (RBD) best fit to human
    ACE2 receptors from the onset of the pandemic](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1)
    and [the insertion of a furin cleavage site](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119)
    between the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein.

    to Fauci and Collins, they shared [the views by Michael Farzan](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21177759/house-oversight-letter-and-email-transcriptions.pdf),
    who said “a likely explanation could be something as simple as passage SARS-live
    CoVs in tissue culture on human cell lines (under BSL-2) for an extended period
    of time, accidently creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission
    between humans via gain of furin site (from tissue culture) and adaption to human
    ACE2 receptor via repeated passage.” It is not certain whether this view is right
    or wrong. What is certain is that they knew SARS-CoV-2 was adapted to human infection
    and transmission as if it had been created in a laboratory, which implied a potential
    risk of causing a pandemic among the human population.

    Fauci, [published a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)
    on March, 2020 in Nature Medicine, which concludes “Our analyses clearly show
    that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”
    Andersen and one of his co-authors, Robert Garry, [testified in the US Congressional
    Hearing](https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/investigating-the-proximal-origin-of-a-cover-up/),
    on July 11, 2023, where they answered they had changed their minds between the
    e-mail and the publication of the paper when asked about the discrepancy of their
    private and public writings. After the hearing, however, [a trove of Slack messages](https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Proximal_Origin_Slack_OCRd.pdf)
    between Andersen and his fellow virologists was revealed, where Andersen wrote
    on April 16, 2020 “We can’t fully disapprove culture… We also can’t rule out engineering…
    furin site still could have been inserted via gibson assembly,” which clearly
    shows he did not change his mind even after the publication of the Nature Medicine
    paper.

    where they denied the lab leak of SARS-CoV-2 and opposed the expansion of oversight
    over virology research recommended by the National Science Advisory Board for
    Biosecurity (NSABB). They claim that stringent rules slow research progress in
    virology to prepare for a future pandemic. However, there have been fierce controversies
    over whether gain-of-function research to enhance virulence or transmissibility
    of viruses can contribute to prepare for pandemics. Kevin Esvelt claimed in [his
    testimony](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/Esvelt%20Testimony.pdf)
    of the Senate hearing on Aug 3, 2022, that the risk of manipulating a virus to
    enhance its pathogenicity outweighs the benefit.

    does not provide beneficial knowledge that outweighs its risk. It is also hard
    to find a definitive proof of the COVID origin, though a lab leak appears an increasingly
    probable cause of the pandemic after the finding by the U.S. Right to Know. Putting
    these controversies aside, one thing is quite certain. Knowledge obtained through
    virology research is useless unless it is utilized in face of a pandemic. The
    virologists who have been heavily funded for the purpose of pandemic prediction
    and preparedness, like [the USAID-funded PREDICT project](https://p2.predict.global/),
    did not immediately share their knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 had a great risk of
    pandemic with its anomalous adaptation to human infections, possibly acquired
    through serial passage. They are accountable for their cover-up. Even if the risky
    virology research is worth taking risks to prepare for future pandemics, it should
    be carried out by a new generation of open-minded researchers. The virologists
    who have conspired to cover-up critical information must be removed from the academic
    community.

    affinity to human ACE2 receptor,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92388-5)
    said in [an interview with Sharri Markson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh2Sj_QpZOA)
    that we had an opportunity in January, 2020 to eradicate this virus out of the
    whole human population. Also, according to Markson’s book titled “[What really
    happened in Wuhan](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/what-really-happened-in-wuhan-sharri-markson),”
    Trump’s National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien, encouraged his European counterparts
    to apply travel ban from China as the US, Australia, and New Zealand did in the
    beginning of February, 2020, which was not realized in spite of his advice. “Ultimately,
    what happened is the Chinese banned travel internally but they continued to allow
    folks from Wuhan and Hubei to go to Europe and ultimately most of the infection
    that took place in the US came from Europe through JFK, because the Europeans
    allowed in massive numbers of Chinese travellers. Had the Europeans taken the
    same approach as the US, Australia and New Zealand on the travel ban, this thing
    could have been contained in a much more aggressive fashion,” O’Brien said to
    Markson.

    real-time basis, a wide range of people including European public health authorities
    could have known the abnormal transmissibility of the virus, and the pandemic
    could have been prevented by restricting international transportation to contain
    the virus in January or in early February, which could have saved millions of
    lives. What is needed to prevent the next pandemic is not to fund more research
    grants to clandestine virologists, but to open immediately all the communications
    among the virologists who are funded for the purpose of pandemic prediction and
    preparedness with taxpayers’ money in case of emergency.

    routes, as David M. Morens, a high-ranking NIH official, did, [who wrote](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023.06.29-BRW-Letter-to-DM-Re.-Origins_Redacted_Final.pdf)
    “As you know, I try to always communicate on gmail because my NIH email is FOIA’d
    constantly” in a September 2021 email. An inescapable strict penalty should be
    imposed for this kind of conduct. Whether the origin of COVID-19 is natural spill-over
    or lab leak, transparency of research activities is essential. We need a drastic
    reform to rectify the secretive culture of life science.
