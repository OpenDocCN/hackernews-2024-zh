    convey correct information on the newly emerging virus. On January 14, 2020 [the
    World Health Organization (WHO) posted](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152)
    on its official twitter (currently X) account “Preliminary investigations conducted
    by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission
    of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.” On February
    2, 2020 [the WHO posted](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1223659708072038400) on
    twitter “Asymptomatic #2019nCoV infection may be rare, and transmission from an
    asymptomatic person is very rare with other coronaviruses, as we have seen with
    MERS. Thus, transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver
    of transmission.” These assertions were eventually contradicted by later findings.
    While these errors may not have stemmed from malintent, it remains uncertain whether
    future public health communications will adapt or change in response to these
    missteps.'

    was published in the Lancet, claiming “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy
    theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” However, a
    great amount of evidence suggests that virologists knew that the SARS-CoV-2 virus,

    who said “a likely explanation could be something as simple as passage SARS-live
    CoVs in tissue culture on human cell lines (under BSL-2) for an extended period
    of time, accidently creating a virus that would be primed for rapid transmission
    between humans via gain of furin site (from tissue culture) and adaption to human
    ACE2 receptor via repeated passage.” It is not certain whether this view is right
    or wrong. What is certain is that they knew SARS-CoV-2 was adapted to human infection
    and transmission as if it had been created in a laboratory, which implied a potential
    risk of causing a pandemic among the human population.

    virology research is useless unless it is utilized in face of a pandemic. The
    virologists who have been heavily funded for the purpose of pandemic prediction
    and preparedness, like [the USAID-funded PREDICT project](https://p2.predict.global/),
    did not immediately share their knowledge that SARS-CoV-2 had a great risk of
    pandemic with its anomalous adaptation to human infections, possibly acquired
    through serial passage. They are accountable for their cover-up. Even if the risky

    Trump’s National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien, encouraged his European counterparts
    to apply travel ban from China as the US, Australia, and New Zealand did in the
    beginning of February, 2020, which was not realized in spite of his advice. “Ultimately,
    what happened is the Chinese banned travel internally but they continued to allow
    folks from Wuhan and Hubei to go to Europe and ultimately most of the infection
    that took place in the US came from Europe through JFK, because the Europeans
    allowed in massive numbers of Chinese travellers. Had the Europeans taken the
    same approach as the US, Australia and New Zealand on the travel ban, this thing
    could have been contained in a much more aggressive fashion,” O’Brien said to
