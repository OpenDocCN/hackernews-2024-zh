- en: The jury in downtown LA on Friday took only a few hours to reject the claims
    by photographer Jeff Sedlik. He sued Von D because she hadn't approached him for
    a license to use the photo he took in 1989 of the jazz legend raising his index
    finger to his lips in a "shush" gesture.

    photograph and that any social media posts that showed Sedlik's photo in the background
    of Kat Von D working on the tattoo was fair use.

    for the tattoo and social media posts by the artist showing her work on the tattoo,
    or $150,000 in statutory damages.

    all visual artists. If the tattoo wasn't found to be substantially similar to
    Sedlik's photo, he said, than no intellectual property rights of visible artists
    were safe.

- en: The Miles Davis tattoo had been a gift to Von D's friend Blake Farmer, a lighting
    technician who worked on some shoots for her makeup business in 2017\. After talking
    with Farmer, who plays trumpet himself, and learning how important Miles Davis
    was to him, she offered to create a tattoo of the musician.

- en: Von D told the jurors that no one in the tattoo world gets a licenses to use
    a photograph as a reference for their creations. She maintained her use of the
    Miles Davis was "fair use" because it was her interpretation of the image and
    served an entirely different purpose than Sedlik's work.

  zh: Von D 告诉陪审团，纹身界没有人会为他们创作的参考照片获得许可证。她坚持认为她对迈尔斯·戴维斯的使用是“公平使用”，因为这是她对图像的诠释，并且与
    Sedlik 的作品完全不同的目的。
- en: Farmer provided Von D with the photo that became the subject of the copyright
    lawsuit. Sedlik, however, turned out to be a stickler when it comes to unlicensed
    use of his work; he regularly scans the internet to find infringers. He testified
    how in 2014 he tracked down another tattoo artist who had posted on social media
    a tattoo he had done based on the same Miles Davis photo.

  zh: Farmer 向 Von D 提供了成为版权诉讼主题的照片。然而，Sedlik 在未经许可使用他的作品方面非常严格；他经常扫描互联网以找到侵权者。他作证说，在
    2014 年，他追踪到另一位纹身艺术家在社交媒体上发布了一张基于同一张迈尔斯·戴维斯照片的纹身。
- en: That artist got away with a free retroactive license after Sedlik contacted
    him and agreed to waive a $5,000 licensing fee as a "professional courtesy" because,
    he testified, the artist apologized and showed contrition for not seeking a license
    beforehand.

  zh: 那位艺术家在 Sedlik 联系他后得到了一个免费的事后许可证，同意免除 5000 美元的许可费作为“专业礼貌”，因为，他作证说，该艺术家为没有事先寻求许可证而道歉并表现出悔意。
- en: Von D said after the verdict that she may never create another tattoo again
    because her heart had been crushed by the ordeal. She added that she might make
    an exception for Farmer, who testified at the trial, because the lawsuit had tainted
    his Miles Davis tattoo.

  zh: Von D 在判决后表示，她可能再也不会创作纹身了，因为她的心被这次事件击碎了。她补充道，她可能会为在审判中作证的 Farmer 例外，因为这起诉讼污染了他的迈尔斯·戴维斯纹身。
