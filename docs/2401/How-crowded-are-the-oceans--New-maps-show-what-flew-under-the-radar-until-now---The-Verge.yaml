- en: Using satellite imagery and AI, researchers have mapped human activity at sea
    with more precision than ever before. The effort exposed a huge amount of industrial
    activity that previously flew under the radar, from suspicious fishing operations
    to an explosion of offshore energy development.

    today in the journal *Nature*. The research led by Google-backed nonprofit Global
    Fishing Watch revealed that a whopping three-quarters of the world’s industrial
    fishing vessels are not publicly tracked. Up to 30 percent of transport and energy
    vessels also escape public tracking.

    of Earth’s land and waters by 2030 under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
    Framework adopted last year. “The question is which 30 percent should we protect?
    And you can’t have discussions about where the fishing activity, where the oil
    platforms are unless you have this map,” says David Kroodsma, one of the authors
    of the *Nature* paper and director of research and innovation at Global Fishing
    Watch.

- en: Until now, Global Fishing Watch and other organizations relied primarily on
    the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) to see what was happening at
    sea. The system tracks vessels that carry a box that sends out radio signals,
    and the data has been used in the past to [document overfishing and forced labor
    on vessels](/22193774/high-seas-fishing-vessels-ais-slave-labor). Even so, there
    are major limitations with the system. Requirements to carry AIS vary by country
    and vessel type. And it’s pretty easy for someone to turn the box off when they
    want to avoid detection, or cruise through locations where signal strength is
    spotty.

    of imagery from the [European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1)
    satellite constellation. Instead of taking traditional optical imagery, which
    is like snapping photos with a camera, Sentinel-1 uses advanced radar instruments
    to observe the surface of the Earth. Radar can penetrate clouds and “see” in the
    dark — and it was able to spot offshore activity that AIS missed.

- en: Since 2,000 terabytes is an enormous amount of data to crunch, the researchers
    developed three deep-learning models to classify each detected vessel, estimate
    their size, and sort out different kinds of offshore infrastructure. They monitored
    some 15 percent of the world’s oceans where 75 percent of industrial activity
    takes place, paying attention to both vessel movements and the development of
    stationary offshore structures like oil rigs and wind turbines between 2017 and
    2021.

    they found dense vessel traffic in areas that “previously showed little to no
    vessel activity” in public tracking systems — particularly around South and Southeast
    Asia, and the northern and western coasts of Africa.

    outnumbered oil structures by the end of 2020\. Turbines made up 48 percent of
    all ocean infrastructure by the following year, while oil structures accounted
    for 38 percent.

    Europe and China. In the Northeast US, clean energy opponents have tried to falsely
    link whale deaths to upcoming offshore wind development even though [evidence

- en: Oil structures have a lot more vessels swarming around them than wind turbines.
    Tank vessels are used at times to transport oil to shore as an alternative to
    pipelines. The number of oil structures grew 16 percent over the five years studied.
    And offshore oil development was linked to five times as much vessel traffic globally
    as wind turbines in 2021\. “The actual amount of vessel traffic globally from
    wind turbines is tiny, compared to the rest of traffic,” Kroodsma says.
