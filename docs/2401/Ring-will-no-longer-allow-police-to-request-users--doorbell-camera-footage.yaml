    tool, which allows police departments and other public safety agencies to request
    and receive video captured by the doorbell cameras through Ring's Neighbors app.

    agencies will still be able to make public posts in the Neighbors app. Police
    and other agencies can also still use the app to "share helpful safety tips, updates,
    and community events," Kuhn said.

    Neighbors app following concerns raised by privacy watchdogs about the company's
    relationship with police departments across the country.

    ability to report what they see as suspicious behavior - can change neighborhoods
    into a place of constant surveillance and lead to more instances of racial profiling.

- en: In a bid to increase transparency, Ring changed its policy in 2021 to make police
    requests publicly visible through its Neighbors app. Previously, law enforcement
    agencies were able to send Ring owners who lived near an area of an active investigation
    private emails requesting video footage.

    casual and warrantless police requests for footage to its users," Matthew Guariglia,
    a senior policy analyst at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation,
    said in a statement on Wednesday.'

    also maintains the right to share footage without user consent in limited circumstances.

- en: In mid-2022, Ring disclosed it handed over 11 videos to police without notifying
    users that year due to "exigent or emergency" circumstances, one of the categories
    that allow it to share videos without permission from owners. However, Guariglia,
    of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the group remains skeptical about
    the ability of police and the company to determine what is or is not an emergency.

    Commission over allegations that the company let employees and contractors access
    user videos. Furthermore, the agency said Ring had inadequate security practices,
    which allowed hackers to control consumer accounts and cameras. The company disagrees
    with those claims.
