  zh: 联邦上诉法院的一组法官周二一致裁定，2021年3月的一次突袭行动后，联邦调查局侵犯了《第四修正案》，当时其特工们搜查了700多个保险箱的内容。
- en: 'In doing so, the judges at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed what
    innocent victims of the raid and their attorneys have been arguing for years:
    that the FBI overstepped the bounds of its warrant issued in the case and failed
    to follow proper protocol when federal agents [cracked open safe-deposit boxes](https://reason.com/2021/05/26/see-the-fbi-dig-through-an-innocent-womans-safe-deposit-box/),
    ran the contents past drug-sniffing dogs, and tried to [seize some of the money

  zh: 这样一来，第九巡回上诉法院的法官们确认了突袭的无辜受害者及其律师多年来一直在主张的观点：联邦调查局在本案中超越了搜查令的范围，并未按照联邦特工[打开保险箱](https://reason.com/2021/05/26/see-the-fbi-dig-through-an-innocent-womans-safe-deposit-box/)、用狗搜查货物以及试图[扣押在箱子里发现的部分现金和其他贵重物品](https://reason.com/2021/05/28/the-fbi-took-their-safe-deposit-box-and-everything-inside-it-two-months-later-theyre-still-waiting-for-it-to-be-returned/)时遵循适当的程序。

    federal agents from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure of the contents
    of the safety [sic] deposit boxes." Under typical FBI procedure, the boxes should
    have been taken into custody until they could be returned to their rightful owners.
    But those "supplemental instructions" drawn up by the special agent in charge
    of the operation told agents to be on the lookout for cash stored inside the safe-deposit
    boxes and to note "anything which suggests the cash may be criminal proceeds."

    that if a government agency were "given the discretion to create customized inventory
    policies" for "each car it impounds and each person detained, the ensuing search
    stops looking like an 'inventory' meant to simply protect property and looks more
    like a criminal investigation of that particular car or person, i.e, more like

  zh: 在裁决的其他地方，史密斯[推测](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24372830-uspv-9th-cir-opinion#document/p26)，如果政府机构被“赋予为‘它扣押的每辆车和每个被拘留的人制定定制库存政策”的自由，那么随后的搜查就不再像是简单地保护财产的‘盘点’，而更像是对特定汽车或人员进行的刑事调查，即更像是‘诡计’。”
- en: '"If there remained any doubt whether the government conducted a ''criminal
    search or seizure,'' that doubt is put to rest by the fact that the government
    has already used some of the information from inside the boxes to obtain additional
    warrants to further its investigations and begin new ones," Smith wrote.'
