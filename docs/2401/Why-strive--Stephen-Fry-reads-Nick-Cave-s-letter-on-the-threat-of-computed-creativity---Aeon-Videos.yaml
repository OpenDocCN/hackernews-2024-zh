- en: In the events series Letters Live, performers read notable letters – old and
    new, original and written by others – in front of a live audience. In this video,
    as part of the Letters Live event at London’s Royal Albert Hall in November 2023,
    the British comedian and writer Stephen Fry reads a letter by the Australian musician
    Nick Cave on what Cave sees as ChatGPT’s potential to erode the human soul – with
    the AI chatbot presumably also standing in for any other generative AI systems
    that might replace human-created art. As Cave’s letter articulates how foregoing
    the struggle of creation risks destroying the ‘collective, essential and unconscious
    human spirit’, his characteristically masterful writing combined with Fry’s powerful
    reading serve as a reminder of the value and vitality of human creativity.
