    are finite, if you are able to capture and use solar power it doesn't prevent
    anyone else from also using as much sunshine as they need.

- en: Except that isn't quite the full story. Beyond a certain size, solar farms become
    large enough to affect the weather around them and ultimately the climate as a
    whole. In our [new research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01117-5)
    published in *Communications Earth & Environment*, we have looked at the effect
    such climate-altering solar farms might have on solar power production elsewhere
    in the world.

- en: We know that solar power is affected by weather conditions and output varies
    through the days and seasons. Clouds, rain, snow and fog can all block sunlight
    from reaching [solar panels](https://techxplore.com/tags/solar+panels/). On a
    cloudy day, output can [drop by 75%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038092X04002373),
    while their efficiency also decreases at high temperatures.

    could affect the cloud cover of certain regions and how much solar power they
    can generate. Northern Europe is likely to see a solar [decrease](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10014)
    for instance, while there should be a slight increase of available solar radiation
    in the rest of Europe, the [US east coast](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00949-9)
    and [northern China](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/10/1/nwac242/6780217).

    continents, they may have a similar impact. In our recent study, we used a [computer
    program](https://ec-earth.org/) to model the Earth system and simulate how hypothetical
    enormous solar farms covering 20% of the Sahara would affect solar power generation
    around the world.

    than reflective desert sand. Although a fraction of the [energy](https://techxplore.com/tags/energy/)
    is converted to electricity, much of it still heats up the panel. And when you
    have millions of these panels grouped together, the whole area warms up. If those
    solar panels were in the Sahara, our simulations show this new heat source would
    rearrange global climate patterns, shifting rainfall away from the tropics and
    leading to the desert becoming greener again, much as it was just 5,000 or so
    years ago.

    could be generated around the world. Regions that would become cloudier and less
    able to generate solar power include the Middle East, southern Europe, India,
    eastern China, Australia, and the US southwest. Areas that would generate more
    solar include Central and South America, the Caribbean, central and eastern US,
    Scandinavia and South Africa.

    in other hotspots in Central Asia, Australia, southwestern US and northwestern
    China—each led to climate changes elsewhere. For instance, huge solar farms covering
    much of the Australian outback would make it sunnier in South Africa, but cloudier
    in the UK, particularly during summer.

    much solar power we build Scandinavia will still be cool and cloudy, Australia
    still hot and sunny.

    scenario was based on covering 20% of the entire desert in PV [solar farms](https://techxplore.com/tags/solar+farms/),
    for instance, and though there have been ambitious proposals, anything on that
    scale is unlikely to happen in the near future. If the covered area is reduced
    to a more plausible (though still unlikely) 5% of the Sahara, the global effects
    become mostly negligible.

    and becomes more reliant on them, the interplay of solar energy resources can
    potentially shape the energy landscape, creating a complex web of dependencies,
    rivalries and opportunities. Geopolitical maneuvering of solar project construction

    the benefits of solar energy are shared equitably around the world. By sharing
    knowledge and working together on the [spatial planning](https://techxplore.com/tags/spatial+planning/)
    of future large-scale solar projects, nations should develop and implement fair
    and sustainable energy solutions and avoid any unintended risks to [solar power](https://techxplore.com/tags/solar+power/)
    production far away.
