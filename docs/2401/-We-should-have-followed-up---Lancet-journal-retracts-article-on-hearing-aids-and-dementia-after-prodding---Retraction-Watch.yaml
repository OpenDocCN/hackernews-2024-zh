    the replication of a published study he was working on as a “sanity check” wasn’t
    producing matching results, his first reaction was “annoyance,” he said.

    Since they apparently do not intend to do so, we would now expect the publisher
    to take action and at least publish our comment (if you don’t plan on retracting
    the paper either). Please also note that the manuscript is a comment, not a correspondence
