- en: Free play is essential for children’s development and for their physical, mental,
    and social health. Opportunities to engage in outdoor free play—and risky play
    in particular—have declined significantly in recent years, in part because safety
    measures have sought to prevent all play-related injuries rather than focusing
    on serious and fatal injuries. Risky play is defined by thrilling and exciting
    forms of free play that involveuncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical
    injury. Proponents of risky play differentiate ‘risk’ from ‘hazard’ and seek to
    reframe perceived risk as an opportunity for situational evaluation and personal
    development. This statement weighs the burden of play-related injuries alongside
    the evidence in favour of risky play, including its benefits, risks, and nuances,
    which can vary depending on a child’s developmental stage, ability, and social
    and medical context. Approaches are offered to promote open, constructive discussions
    with families and organizations. Paediatricians are encouraged to think of outdoor
    risky play as one way to help prevent and manage common health problems such as
    obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues.

    and social health^([[1](#ref1)]). The right to play is recognized in the United
    Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to be as fundamental as the rights
    to be cared for and protected from violence^([[2](#ref2)]). Children engaged in
    free play are also building social and executive functioning skills that are critical
    for school readiness and lifelong achievement^([[3](#ref3)])^([[4](#ref4)]). Over
    the last several decades, family and social trends have increasingly prioritized
    the supervision and protection of children. A shift in the balance of play has
    also occurred, with unscheduled free play outdoors steadily giving way to planned,
    structured activities, including extra-curriculars and academics, in the lives
    of most children^([[3](#ref3)])^([[5](#ref5)])^([[6](#ref6)]). Children are spending
    more of their recreational time indoors (and often on screens) than playing outside
    with minimal supervision^([[1](#ref1)]). The 2022 ParticipACTION report card gave
    Canadian children a ‘D’ grade for overall physical activity and a ‘D−’ for active
    play^([[7](#ref7)]). Many Canadian organizations are now calling for a shift in
    strategies to keep children “as safe as necessary” rather than “as safe as possible”,
    and a more balanced approach to healthy and active living that encourages the
    developmental benefits of risk-taking as well as preventing injury^([[8](#ref8)]).

    Based on evidence gathered over the last 15 years, primarily in children 1 to
    13 years of age^([[12](#ref12)]), risky play is often further categorized into
    various play types ([Table 1](#Table%201))^([[11](#ref11)])^([[13](#ref13)]).
    These categories are purposefully imprecise because activities can differ widely
    based on a child’s developmental stage (rather than age), past experience, and

    to push boundaries and test limits. Risky play encourages creative, spontaneous
    play, first by eliminating hazards, then by supporting risk-taking that is chosen
    and controlled by the child and appropriate to her/his experience and ability
    ([Text box 1](#Text%20box%201))^([[11](#ref11)]). The concept of risky play is
    a response, in part, to restrictive safety programs and measures that have become
    more broadly implemented—and sometimes mandated—in child care settings, schools,
    and playgrounds in recent years. Given the developmental benefits of play-related
    risk-taking (detailed below), some researchers are advocating for safety rules
    that effectively prevent serious injury and death while helping children develop
    risk management strategies that are essential aspects of healthy and active growth^([[1](#ref1)])^([[17](#ref17)]).

- en: The literature on risky play has highlighted the need for a balanced approach
    between risk and hazard, where children’s overall health and well-being are served
    by addressing both their developmental and injury prevention needs. Environments
    such as a busy roadway or rough waters pose hazards that any responsible adult
    will recognize as hazardous. Yet some activities, like play around fire or rough-and-tumble
    play, offer a more nuanced relationship between risk and hazard, especially when
    taking characteristics of the individual child into account. The adult’s role
    is to identify hazards and remove or mitigate them, then to supervise appropriately
    for the type of activity as well as the child’s skill level, personality, and
    developmental stage (which may also involve no supervision). The degree of autonomy
    children have can be determined by how well an adult knows the children at play
    and their capabilities. Adults should always be ready to intervene when child’s
    play becomes a danger to self or others. Preventing children from engaging in
    risky play experiences is different from intervening in a timely manner that takes
    their skill level and self-confidence into account.

    ‘nature play’, ‘active play’, ‘adventurous play’, and ‘free’ or ’unstructured’
    play. These terms are defined in the “Terminology and taxonomy of the Play, Learn,
    and Teach Outdoors-Network (PlaTO-Net)^([[14](#ref14)]). This work standardizes
    terminology and recognizes that organizations will understand the role and consequences
    of risk-taking differently and may prefer to use a range of terms to advance conversations
    about play. However, when children are free to play as they choose, risk is always
    present, though in different forms, and all descriptive terms imply some measure
    of risky play.

    Risky play may also contribute to supporting engagement in physical activities

    the cognitive, affective, and physical skills to ensure lifelong physical activity-related
    behaviours. Physical literacy interventions have been shown to improve several
    outcomes related to physical activity and health^([[25](#ref25)]) and to reduce
    the likelihood of injury in sport settings^([[26](#ref26)]). One recent study

    play with better problem-solving scores in boys^([[21](#ref21)]). Following a

    forearm) to be unrelated to the height of playground equipment^([[37](#ref37)]).

    falls from playground equipment higher than 1.5 m with higher fracture odds^([[38](#ref38)]).

    Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) data on proportion of injury

    opportunities for spontaneous risky play. Such opportunities may include supervising
    children less closely (e.g., accepting that a child may climb higher, without
    a restraining hand or remaining at arm's length to break a fall). Ensuring there
    is time in a child’s schedule for free play, encouraging play with natural, loose
