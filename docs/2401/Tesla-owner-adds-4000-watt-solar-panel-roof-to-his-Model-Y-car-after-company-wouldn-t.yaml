    with the space, and it could help power EVs.

    elements like this, precious few are road-legal, and the list of actual car manufacturers
    allowing this sort of option for real customers is vanishingly thin - with [Tesla](https://www.uniladtech.com/vehicles/car-news/tesla-owner-shares-electric-bill-504687-20240117?)
    one of the many who don't.

    at that point.

    day (unless it's in a [garage](https://www.uniladtech.com/vehicles/car-news))
    so could be gathering solar energy as you drive to extend your car's range - it's
    literally free energy.

    car, YouTuber DartSolar took things into his own hands.

    a folding-out array of nine solar panels to go on top of their Tesla [Model](https://www.uniladtech.com/vehicles/car-news/tesla-monthly-cost-lease-model-3-402732-20240118?)

    This means it's not exactly a guide if you want to try it yourself, and the results
    are really interesting.

    squared off, and basically just sit on top of the car like a big plank of wood.

    he could gain anywhere from 20 to 75 miles of extra range for his Tesla, accounting
    for different conditions.

    bit of inspiration - and engineers will start thinking about how to make this
    dream a reality for the rest of us.
