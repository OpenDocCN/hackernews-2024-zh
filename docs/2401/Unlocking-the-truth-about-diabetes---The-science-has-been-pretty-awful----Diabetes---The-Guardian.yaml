    when he was a little-known science journalist and author of two books on scientific
    controversies, an article of his was published in the *New York Times*, headlined:
    [What If It’s All Been a Big Fat Lie?](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html)
    In it, he argued that the low-fat dietary advice of the previous couple of decades
    wasn’t only incorrect, but actively dangerous and the reason for, as he put it,
    the “rampaging epidemic of obesity in America”. For Taubes, dietary fat wasn’t
    a problem at all. Instead, the real danger was carbohydrate, he asserted, sparking
    a backlash, and fuelling the ongoing conversation about what constitutes a “healthy
    diet”. He wasn’t the first to assert that carbs were bad ([Robert Atkins](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/apr/19/guardianobituaries.williamleith)
    got there before him), but perhaps because of his serious and scientific background
    – he has a physics degree from Harvard and studied aerospace engineering at Stanford
    – he has been a polarising figure, with as many ardent followers as detractors.'

    including his latest, *Rethinking Diabetes*, in which he posits that low-carb
    diets have been under-used as a way to manage blood glucose in [type 1](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-1-diabetes/)
    and [type 2](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/) diabetes, in favour
    of drug-heavy treatment regimes which, he suspects, may do more harm than good.

- en: His writing on nutrition has won several awards, notably from the US National
    Association of Science Writers, but it has also been sharply criticised, mainly
    for his almost evangelical attachment to the keto diet, in which you eat so little
    carbohydrate (50g or less per day) that the body goes into a state called ketosis,
    meaning you stop burning stored glucose and start burning fat instead. In 2021,
    he published *[The Case for Keto](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/03/the-case-for-keto-review-why-a-full-fat-diet-should-be-on-the-menu)*,
    a self-help book, after which, as he says, he went “from being a respected source
    of information to somebody who may indeed be a crank after all”. Taubes, who follows
    the diet himself, is now proposing it should be offered to people living with
    diabetes. (Keto diets were originally developed as a way to treat certain types
    of childhood epilepsy.) For Taubes, keto means he doesn’t “eat starches, grains
    or sweets, and I don’t eat breakfast because I think better in the morning without
    it. When I snack, it’s nuts or good cheese. If we were to go to dinner together,
    I’d order a piece of fish or half a roast chicken and ask the waiter to hold the
    rice or potatoes and give me a green salad or green vegetables instead.”

    diabetes research and how, in the first half of the 20th century, it went – as
    Taubes sees it – wrong, with the emergence of a treatment doctrine that mistakenly
    allowed people living with diabetes to eat whatever they wanted, all the while
    using insulin and drugs, such as [metformin](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/metformin/),
    to manage the blood-glucose consequences. Taubes has always been fascinated by
    bad science and for him this was bad science of the highest order, because the
    regime was based on dietary hypotheses which he says had not – and still have
    not – been rigorously tested.

    diabetes and although various options were tried by early practitioners, low-carb
    was, says Taubes, among the most popular (with medics, at least). Insulin was
    a gamechanger. Not only did it almost magically save the lives of children with
    type 1 diabetes, who would often arrive at hospital comatose and die swiftly afterwards,
    but it also meant that people with diabetes of both types could eat a more or
    less normal diet.

- en: Another example, for Taubes, of how early researchers were mistaken, concerns
    the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which are so different they
    almost shouldn’t share a name. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which
    the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce
    insulin, the hormone which regulates the level of glucose in our blood; people
    living with type 1 need insulin injections or an insulin pump, to survive. Like
    type 2, type 1 can cause complications such as heart, kidney or eye disease, and
    nerve damage.

    in which the body either can’t make or can’t use insulin (AKA insulin resistance)
    to metabolise glucose, leading to persistently high levels in the blood. Ultimately,
    people living with type 2 diabetes may need insulin and other diabetes medications,
    too, but for a lot of people, diet and lifestyle modifications can defer that
    need. Many, but not all, specialists think there is often a causal relationship
    between weight and type 2 diabetes, which has led to a high level of stigma around
    the diagnosis. Diagnoses of both are rising globally – [five million people](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-us/about-the-charity/our-strategy/statistics#:~:text=We%20estimate%20that%20more%20than,are%20yet%20to%20be%20diagnosed.)

    instead of diabetes medications. “When insulin therapy started in the 1920s, they
    had no idea what the long-term side-effects were or what the long-term consequences
    of living with diabetes were [because most people with type 1 died],” he says.
    “Then doctors find out that it’s just easier to let patients eat whatever they
    want and give them drugs to cover them. Then it’s another five, 10 or 20 years
    before they start seeing the long-term complications, which they think of as long-term
    complications of the disease.” What he wishes scientists at the time had concluded
    was: “The reason we’re keeping them alive is insulin therapy. So what we’re seeing
    is the long-term complications of the disease as controlled by insulin therapy,
    and the insulin therapy might be causing the complications as much as the disease

    a pill or a diet, we all want the pill. But if you’re told a pill or a diet and
    the diet will keep you healthy and the pill will give you a chronic degenerative
    disorder where you’re still going to have these horrible complications, they are

    general, the literature was very thoroughly assessed and I was part of that panel.
    Very low-carbohydrate diets had no better results than the modest reduction of
    carbohydrates,” he says. Other studies, such as one in 2022 at [Stanford](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/keto-diets-fall-short/#:~:text=In%20a%20head%2Dto%2Dhead,diet%20drastically%20restricts%20carbohydrate%20intake.)

    motivated.” She didn’t suggest keto, “but she made clear the volume of sugars
    in bread and pasta, and supposedly healthy things like fruit juice, which is just
    sugar. I gave them up. I didn’t replace them with fat, just more protein, lots
    of vegetables, berries, soya milk and yoghurt, beans and lentils and pasta made

    is safe or effective for people with type 1 diabetes. Because of this, we do not
    recommend low-carb diets to people with type 1 diabetes.” What Taubes would probably
    add is that there isn’t much evidence that they’re unsafe either, because low-carb
    diets haven’t been studied intensively either within or beyond the diabetes research
    community. But diet is incredibly difficult to study – especially in a context
    like diabetes where subjects are also often medicated. One of the tropes of nutritional
    science is that drawing long-term health conclusions from what people eat is nigh
    on impossible, because diet interacts with lifestyle, because people lie, intentionally
    or not, about what they eat, and because longitudinal studies of diet are so expensive.'

    might be a good way to control blood sugars,” she says, “but I am now on an insulin
    pump system that allows me complete freedom over what I eat. If I eat less carbs,
    my insulin stays more in range. I see the impact it has on my blood sugars, but

    thanks to the technology that’s available, in range between 70% and 90% of the
    time on an average day, and that is brilliant. I don’t need to eat low-carb for
    this to be the case.” Having diabetes is also a risk factor for eating disorders
    and Sohal’s relationship with food veered towards unhealthy when she was first

    interaction.” Even in a highly motivated group, like people trying to control
    diabetes, adherence to low-carb is pretty patchy: a 2022 paper tracked this low
    adherence and pointed to cultural, religious and – perhaps most important – economic
    barriers. Keto can be expensive and labour-intensive, as well as socially awkward,

    high-fat, low-carb way of life, so I find his concern surprising. “Well, my world
