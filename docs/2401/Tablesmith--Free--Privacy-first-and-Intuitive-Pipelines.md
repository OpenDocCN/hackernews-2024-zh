## Why Tablesmith

## Spreadsheet Automation

Tablesmith offers six stage types: filter, sort, group, add column, update column, and data extraction. You can combine these to form highly complex pipelines. All stage types are easy to understand and configure. You can add them in seconds, and with the powerful formula editor, you can write formulas using columns and variables. Another cool feature is that you can publish your pipeline as a web app. Check out the demos below; they are all real pipelines.

#### Demo Pipelines

You can run these pipelines without logging in. Download a demo input file first([tracks.csv](https://tablesmith.io/app/assets/assets/tracks.csv) or [tracks.xlsx](https://tablesmith.io/app/assets/assets/tracks.xlsx)). Clicking any pipeline will take you to its shared page where you can simply click **Run** and select the downloaded file. Curious about the pipeline’s inner workings? Just click the **Clone** button.

## Spreadsheet AI
