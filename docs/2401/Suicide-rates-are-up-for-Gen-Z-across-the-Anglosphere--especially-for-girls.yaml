    were in their youth. It turns out that in each of the five Anglosphere nations,
    suicide rates among adolescent girls (ages 10-19) are at all-time highs (since
    modern records have been kept). Suicide rates for Gen Z girls now surpass those
    seen during the adolescent and young adult years of Millennials (born 1981-1995),

    relationships, shifting childhood from one that was (generally) in-person, embodied,
    synchronous, and play-based to one that was (generally) virtual, disembodied,
    largely asynchronous, and phone-based. Since the early 2010s, stable in-person
    communities and relationships have rapidly disintegrated, as transient networks
    of low-investment relationships took their place. Figure 19 shows that American
    teens and young adults were already socially distanced from each other by 2019,
    *before* covid restrictions were imposed on them.'

    leading candidate for being the major cause of the international collapse of adolescent
    mental health. The [evidence of causation](https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic)
    is particularly [strong for girls](https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls).
    In fact, *nobody has yet put forth an alternative theory*—one that can explain
    why the same thing happened at the same time in so many countries. Jean Twenge
    recently considered thirteen such theories that have been proposed to explain
    trends in the U.S., and [she showed that they don’t even work in the U.S.](https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/13-explanations-mental-health-crisis),
    let alone internationally.

    comments. Just make sure your theory applies all over the Anglosphere.
