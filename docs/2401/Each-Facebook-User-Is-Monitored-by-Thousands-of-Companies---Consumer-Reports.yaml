    data collection practices, some of which could be part of a national digital privacy
    law, something that the organization has long advocated for. The recommendations
    specifically aimed at Meta’s technology and the advertisers who use it include:'

    is a mobile app by Consumer Reports that allows users to quickly opt out of and
    delete data from a long list of companies and data brokers on behalf of users;
    the app takes advantage of state privacy laws’ authorized agent provisions.'

    that the burden is on the consumer to take action to prevent this data collection.
    Even a “global opt-out” mechanism allowing users to avoid having their data shared
    is not enough because “that still requires the user to take an action to protect
    their privacy. A lot of people are not going to have the time or knowledge to
    do that,” Fitzgerald said.

    data minimization technologies to keep up with evolving expectations. As we cover
    in our terms, businesses are responsible for getting permission to share people’s
    information with companies like ours.”

    few options. “I think people should be encouraging their elected officials to
    pass privacy laws that require businesses to change some of these business practices
    to stop this ubiquitous tracking of our every click and every movement,” Fitzgerald
    said.
