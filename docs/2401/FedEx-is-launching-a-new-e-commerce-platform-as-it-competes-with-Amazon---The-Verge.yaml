    today that it will launch a new “data-driven commerce platform” this fall [called
    fdx](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fedex.com%2Fen-us%2Fdigital-transformation.html)
    that it says will give online merchants “end-to-end e-commerce solutions.” The
    company’s new platform is aimed at helping businesses manage their supply chain,
    sell to customers, and manage deliveries.

    tools, like access to members of ShopRunner, an e-commerce marketplace FedEx [acquired
    in 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2020/12/14/why-fedexs-shoprunner-deal-wont-help-much-with-its-amazon-problem/),
    with features debuting in the fall like the ability to create a “custom post-purchase
    experience” so brands can give customers more accurate shipment information or
    use insight from FedEx’s shipment network data for order management.

    FedEx has seen as [a threat to its business](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/fedex-now-calls-amazon-a-competitor.html)
    for years. In 2019, FedEx [declined to renew](/2019/6/7/18656813/amazon-prime-fedex-express-delivery-logistics-network-contract-termination-usps-ups)
    a contract to fly Amazon cargo through FedEx Express. Later that year, Amazon
    [forbade its sellers from using FedEx](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/12/18/amazon-blocked-sellers-from-using-fedex-and-now-we-know-why/?sh=c009ae32da13)
    for Prime deliveries during the holidays, blaming declining performance — a ban

    more home package deliveries](https://www.wsj.com/business/amazon-vans-outnumber-ups-fedex-750f3c04)
    in the US in 2022 than either of them. That’s just a few years after the online
    retail giant built up a logistics operation that largely uses tightly controlled
    third-party contractors that Amazon [insists aren’t its employees](/2023/6/18/23765330/amazon-delivery-drivers-union-teamsters).
