- en: Orthic shorthand is a faster way to write. Simply replacing the usual English
    alphabet with its optimized alphabet will let you write 2–3x your usual handwriting
    speed. This one change will let you write at 60–90 words per minute!

- en: Orthic replaces the multi-step letters of your preschool alphabet with a Cambridge
    University-minted alphabet tuned for rapid yet legible writing. It’s quick, compact,
    and still readable over a century later.

- en: Once you’ve got the hang of that **fully-written style,** Orthic’s got extra
    shortcuts to boost your writing speed. The **ordinary style** adds abbreviations
    for common words and endings as well as shortcuts that imply letters without having
    to write them. It’s designed so you could send a snapshot of your writing to another
    Orthic writer, or to yourself in ten years, and have no trouble reading what you
    wrote.

- en: 'To go even faster, you’ll need to master the extreme shortcuts of the **reporting
    style.** This style is not intended to be easily read by anyone other than the
    original writer: it trades universal comprehensibility for maximal compactness
    and expressiveness. The top recorded speed was 190 words per minute.'
