- en: When was the last time you used Microsoft Edge? For some, Windows' default browser
    is their new app of choice for browsing the web, while others haven't seriously
    used Edge since its release. And while there are plenty of [reasons why Microsoft
    Edge is the best browser](https://www.xda-developers.com/5-reasons-microsoft-edge-best-browser/),
    Microsoft still manages to annoy both Edge lovers and haters alike.

    For example, Microsoft is adding a new super drag-and-drop feature that makes
    opening new tabs easy. However, it feels like for every step forward Microsoft
    makes with its browser, it proceeds to take two steps back and undo all the good
    work it does with its browser. Here's how Microsoft is hampering its own browser's
    popularity.

- en: There's a long-running joke in the technology world; Microsoft Edge isn't such
    a bad browser, because it's perfect for downloading Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
    on a new [desktop PC](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-desktop-computers/).
    It seems that Microsoft doesn't like Edge being a glorified third-party browser
    download manager, because it loaded Edge with lots of pester boxes that pop up
    if you try to swap browsers.

- en: If you've never experienced this before, boot up Edge and go through the process
    of downloading Google Chrome. If you search for "Google Chrome" through the address
    bar, it will bring up Bing's search results with a Microsoft Edge header banner
    claiming that "there's no need to download a new web browser." Click on the search
    result for Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge will show a small dialog box in the
    browser asking you to stick with it. Click on the "Download" button, and Edge
    shows another banner advertising itself. The browser's clinginess only makes it
    less appealing for those it's trying to convince.

    rolling out pester boxes that appear if you try to change the default search engine
    to anything but Bing. While this feature hasn't been rolled out to everyone yet,
    the news of its existence annoyed people who otherwise liked using Edge. As such,
    Edge's desire to pester you into doing what it wants is harming its image in the
    eyes of its haters and lovers alike.

    browser of choice, Edge still won't give up without a fight. If you click a link
    within Windows, it will open within Edge, even after you [change the default browser
    in Windows 11](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-change-default-browser-windows-11/).
    This includes anything you click within the "News and Interests" widget and search
    results from the web within Windows Search, which has resulted in me not using
    either of those features.

- en: Users have rallied to try to break Windows' dependency on Edge, including developing
    apps like MSEdgeRedirect. These apps override Windows' decision making so you
    can set whichever browser you prefer for links within Windows. And because it
    has gotten popular, the developers have added extra features to MSEdgeRedirect,
    such as allowing people to remove Edge from their computers. As such, Microsoft's
    desire to have all Windows-based links only open in Edge has strengthened the
    resistance against it.

- en: Microsoft Edge didn't always use Chromium, the framework that runs Google Chrome.
    Beforehand, it used Microsoft's bespoke code. However, Microsoft Edge was lagging
    far behind Chrome in terms of performance and usability, so Microsoft bit the
    bullet and released a new version of Edge that used the Chromium base. It was
    an immediate success, with people praising how good the Chromium-based Edge was
    over the older, Microsoft-developed one.

- en: However, as time has passed, more and more Chromium-based browsers have sprung
    up. Opera, OperaGX, Brave, and Vivaldi are some of the bigger Chromium players,
    and there are countless more alternatives designed to suit everyone's use case.
    Sure, Microsoft Edge's Chromium framework means it runs as well as any other Chromium
    browser, but it also means it doesn't do anything particularly special that draws
    people over to it.

    been a lot of fear online that Manifest V3 will prevent adblocking extensions
    from working, causing people to look for alternatives. Google will also disable
    Manifest V2 extensions in June 2024, leaving people stranded for options.

- en: The problem is that Manifest V3 will affect every browser that currently uses
    Chromium as a framework, including Microsoft Edge. Right now, anyone concerned
    about Manifest V3 is making the pilgrimage over to Mozilla Firefox, the only mainstream
    browser that doesn't use Chromium. And if Manifest V3 does prove unpopular, any
    users Microsoft Edge has garnered over the years may jump ship to another browser.

    with the browser at its base level. However, the way Microsoft tries to force
    Edge on its consumers mars the public's opinion about it, regardless if they want
    to use it or not. And with Manifest V3 on the horizon, Microsoft Edge may get
    left behind in the great browser race.
