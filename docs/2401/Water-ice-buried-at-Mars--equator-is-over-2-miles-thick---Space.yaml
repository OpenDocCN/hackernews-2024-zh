    [Mars](https://www.space.com/47-mars-the-red-planet-fourth-planet-from-the-sun.html)
    for 20 years now. While it's not the first time that evidence for ice has been
    found near the Red Planet's equator, this new discovery is by far the largest
    amount of water ice detected there so far and appears to match previous discoveries
    of frozen water on Mars.

    and are similar to the signals we see from Mars'' polar caps, which we know to
    be very ice rich," said lead researcher Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institution
    in the United States in an ESA statement.'

    a crust of hardened ash and dry dust hundreds of meters thick. The ice is not
    a pure block but is heavily contaminated by dust. While its presence near the
    equator is a location more easily accessible to future crewed missions, being
    buried so deep means that accessing the water-ice would be difficult.

    called the [Medusae Fossae Formation](https://www.space.com/mars-wind-dust-image-esa-mars-express-photo)
    (MFF), but scientists were not sure what those deposits consisted of. Mars' geography
    is split between northern highlands and southern lowlands, and the huge 5,000-km-long
    MMF is situated near the boundary between the two.

    lava flows and was covered in volcanic ash during an era long ago when Mars was
    volcanically active. Today, the MMF is [covered in heaps of dust](https://www.space.com/mars-wind-dust-image-esa-mars-express-photo)

    dust on the entire planet, fuel for the giant [dust storms](https://www.space.com/mars-dust-storms-science-mysteries)
    that can engulf Mars on a seasonal basis. Were the deposits just dust, perhaps
    filling a deep valley?

    Formation (MFF). The MFF consists of a series of wind-sculpted deposits measuring
    hundreds of kilometers across and several kilometers high. Found at the boundary
    between Mars'' highlands and lowlands, the deposits are possibly the biggest single
    source of dust on Mars, and one of the most extensive deposits on the planet.

    it to become compacted under its own weight," said Andrea Cicchetti of the National
    Institute for Astrophysics in Italy in a press statement. "This would create something
    far denser than what we actually see with MARSIS."'

    Sub-surface ice has been found in plentiful quantities on Mars before; NASA's
    Phoenix mission dug up ice just beneath the dusty surface at the lander's polar
    landing site in 2008\. Meanwhile, early in its mission, Mars Express detected
    abundant water-ice extending down into the mid-latitudes, and NASA's [Mars Odyssey](https://www.space.com/18270-mars-odyssey.html)
    even found clues to the presence of water in the MMF in 2009.

- en: The ice's existence could be the result of Mars' wandering axis. Across the
    Red Planet's history, the axial tilt of the planet's poles is understood to have
    varied quite chaotically. Currently Mars' poles are tilted to the ecliptic by
    25 degrees (compared to Earth, which has a tilt of 23 degrees) but in the past
    this could have ranged from as shallow an angle as 10 degrees, to as extreme an
    angle as 60 degrees.

- en: During the periods of high obliquity, when the poles are pointing closer to
    the sun than the equator, water-ice could form in large quantities on the surface
    at the equator. That ice could then be buried by ash and dust falls, to remain
    covered to this day.
