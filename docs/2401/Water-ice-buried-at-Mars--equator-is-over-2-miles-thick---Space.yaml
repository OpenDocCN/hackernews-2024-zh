    a crust of hardened ash and dry dust hundreds of meters thick. The ice is not
    a pure block but is heavily contaminated by dust. While its presence near the
    equator is a location more easily accessible to future crewed missions, being
    buried so deep means that accessing the water-ice would be difficult.

    dust on the entire planet, fuel for the giant [dust storms](https://www.space.com/mars-dust-storms-science-mysteries)

    filling a deep valley?

    Sub-surface ice has been found in plentiful quantities on Mars before; NASA's
    Phoenix mission dug up ice just beneath the dusty surface at the lander's polar
    landing site in 2008\. Meanwhile, early in its mission, Mars Express detected
    abundant water-ice extending down into the mid-latitudes, and NASA's [Mars Odyssey](https://www.space.com/18270-mars-odyssey.html)
    even found clues to the presence of water in the MMF in 2009.

    25 degrees (compared to Earth, which has a tilt of 23 degrees) but in the past
