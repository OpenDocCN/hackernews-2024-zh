- en: The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) does not furnish data specifically tailored
    for litigation. The data describing astronomical phenomena, provided by the USNO,
    are intended for public information and general use. The data are computed and
    are not reports of observed or recorded events. The computations assume certain
    conditions and the data might therefore not be relevant to the facts at issue
    in a specific case. The data are provided without seal or certification regarding
    authority, custody, or authenticity, and acceptance by a court is not guaranteed.

- en: Astronomical data are sometimes needed for civil or criminal court proceedings,
    especially where there is an issue of the amount of natural illumination available
    during the incident in question. Both astronomical and meteorological information
    may be needed in such cases.

    phenomena—for example, observed times of sunrise, sunset, twilight, or Moon phases—
    that might be useful for litigation.** Such observations are not regularly made
    by any agency of the U.S. Government, since the relevant data can be computed
    for past or future dates to sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes. In
    this sense, astronomical data are different from weather data, which must be observed
    and recorded.'

- en: The [Astronomical Applications Department](/index) of the USNO provides Web
    pages where these computations can be made online. For example, the Web page titled
    [Sun and Moon Data for One Day](/data/RS_OneDay) provides sunrise/sunset, moonrise/moonset,
    and twilight times along with Moon phase for any specific date and place. Other
    astronomical information can be found in the department's [Data Services](/data/index)
    pages. There is no charge for these data services. These kinds of astronomical
    computations can also usually be performed by any observatory, planetarium, university
    astronomy department, or other competent authority.

    containing the calculated data, there are several private-sector sources that
    can be used. Resources that can assist you in finding information and expert testimony
    are listed below under [Forensic Services](/faq/lawyers#forensic).
