    students might be so critical of themselves for making mistakes in school assignments,
    that they will postpone doing homework to avoid dealing with the associated negative
    emotions. Similarly, perfectionistic writers might be so worried about their book
    being criticized, that they will delay sending the book for feedback.

    criticism](https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1213374), this can exacerbate

    can lead to procrastination. For example, it can increase the negative emotions
    that people experience when they make mistakes, which leads people to delay their

    the associated [negative emotions](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z).
    Alternatively, perfectionism can substantially increase people’s expectations
    of themselves, which [increases](https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098) the [discrepancy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.02.059)

    For example, this can happen when someone’s perfectionism makes them afraid of
    negative feedback, which causes them to procrastinate, which leads them to perform
    poorly and get negative feedback, which makes them more afraid of getting negative
    feedback again in the future, and so on.

    that’s caused primarily by their perfectionism. For example, an artist can be
