    This extension fixes that.

- en: 'When you''re browsing the replies, and replies-to-replies, of a popular tweet,
    you may be surprised to see that hitting the back button from a ''replies-to-replies''
    thread puts you back at the start of the original reply thread, instead of at
    the position you last were. You now have to scroll down (sometimes a long way
    down) to continue your reading of the original tweet''s replies. This extension
    fixes the user experience by auto-scrolling to your last position in the reply
    thread, and highlighting the tweet you last read. This extension is open-source.
    The source code is here: https://github.com/ackinc/keep-twitter-scroll-position'
