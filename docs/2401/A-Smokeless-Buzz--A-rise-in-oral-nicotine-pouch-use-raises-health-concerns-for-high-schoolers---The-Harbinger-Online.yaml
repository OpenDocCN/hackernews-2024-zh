    circular plastic container. Pulling out a white pouch the size of a piece of gum,
    Miller pops it in her bottom lip and her headache melts away. What looks like
    just a stick of minty gum to her teacher and classmates is really a fix of nicotine
    sprinkled with artificial flavoring and preservatives.

- en: “In the past, if I wanted nicotine during class, I’d have to go to the bathroom,”
    Miller said. “Now with Zyn — and this is probably what makes them so bad — when

    East students, according to an Instagram poll of 200 students and community members.
    Out of the students who responded to the poll, 23% said that they use them during
    school. This mirrors a national trend of teen nicotine pouch use — with Partnership
    to End Addiction reporting in 2020 that 13% of 15-24-year-olds used oral nicotine
    pouches in the past 30 days, and with an increasing number of young people reporting

  zh: 国家反尼古丁组织“真相倡议”副总裁梅根·雅各布斯声称，与吸烟相比，Zyn 和类似的尼古丁袋仍然很危险，尽管它们没有烟草叶。雅各布斯指出的主要误解是，一些人认为
    Zyn 是戒烟的一步，但实际上它并没有像尼古丁贴片或口香糖产品那样作为尼古丁替代品来推广。
- en: “Zyn or other oral nicotine pouches are [just as dangerous as] tobacco products,”
    Jacobs said. “They are produced by big tobacco companies and they’re marketed
    as a recreational kind of nicotine. They’re not regulated like a nicotine replacement
    product.”

- en: Jacobs says that this is due to a few reasons, the first being advertising.
    Leading nicotine pouch brands spent nearly $25 million on ads between January
    2019 and September 2021\. Additionally, Zyn’s popularity in media and pop culture
    has skyrocketed in the past year. Tucker Carlson’s endorsement of the product
    on the “Full Send” podcast, Major League baseball players using nicotine pouches
    to avoid the league’s tobacco bans and trending TikTok videos with millions of
    likes joking about the iconic circular containers and dubbing the pouches “upper-decky
    lip pillows.”

    Carlson在“Full Send”播客上为该产品背书，Major League棒球运动员使用尼古丁袋以避免联盟的烟草禁令，并且在TikTok上有数百万点赞的趋势视频，讽刺象征性的圆形容器，并将袋子称为“上层嘴唇枕头”。

    Smith wasn’t aware that using Zyn delivered *more*nicotine per use than his vape
