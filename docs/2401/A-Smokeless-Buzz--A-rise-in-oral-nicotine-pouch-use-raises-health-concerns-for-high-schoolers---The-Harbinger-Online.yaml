    on the lesson and starts getting a splitting headache.

    circular plastic container. Pulling out a white pouch the size of a piece of gum,
    Miller pops it in her bottom lip and her headache melts away. What looks like
    just a stick of minty gum to her teacher and classmates is really a fix of nicotine
    sprinkled with artificial flavoring and preservatives.

    Miller said. “Now with Zyn — and this is probably what makes them so bad — when
    I’m sitting in class and if I really want to have one, I can have one. It’s really
    easy to just reach in my backpack and sneak a ‘piece of gum.’”

    East students, according to an Instagram poll of 200 students and community members.
    Out of the students who responded to the poll, 23% said that they use them during
    school. This mirrors a national trend of teen nicotine pouch use — with Partnership
    to End Addiction reporting in 2020 that 13% of 15-24-year-olds used oral nicotine
    pouches in the past 30 days, and with an increasing number of young people reporting
    use of the products.

    no tobacco leaf — these are the reasons why Miller almost exclusively uses Zyn

    for the past decade, but only recently blew up in popularity. Zyn usage has doubled
    each year since 2019, according to the American Cancer Society, and sales of nicotine
    pouch products increased from $126.06 million from August to December 2019 to
    $808.14 million from January to March 2022.

    high schoolers and young adults, some experts raise concerns about the perceived
    “safety” of the product.

- en: Vice President of the national anti-nicotine organization Truth Initiative Megan
    Jacobs asserts that Zyn and similar nicotine pouches are still dangerous in comparison
    to vaping, despite their lack of tobacco lead. The main misconception Jacobs points
    out is that some people think Zyn is a step to quit, but it’s actually not marketed
    as a nicotine replacement like nicotine patches or gum products are.

    Jacobs said. “They are produced by big tobacco companies and they’re marketed
    as a recreational kind of nicotine. They’re not regulated like a nicotine replacement
    product.”

    seen a significant increase in number of users at parties and on social media
    these past few months.

    more as time has gone on,” Miller said. “With nicotine usage as a whole, you can
    tell there’s like developments and trends, and this is the new fad I guess. But
    it’s especially getting popular with college-age kids and also at parties I just
    see more people having them.”

    Leading nicotine pouch brands spent nearly $25 million on ads between January
    2019 and September 2021\. Additionally, Zyn’s popularity in media and pop culture
    has skyrocketed in the past year. Tucker Carlson’s endorsement of the product
    on the “Full Send” podcast, Major League baseball players using nicotine pouches
    to avoid the league’s tobacco bans and trending TikTok videos with millions of
    likes joking about the iconic circular containers and dubbing the pouches “upper-decky
    lip pillows.”

    middle school. However, he says that he’s found out that the pouches have worsened
    his nicotine cravings.

    replace vaping, hoping it was a step toward quitting nicotine altogether. However,
    Smith wasn’t aware that using Zyn delivered *more*nicotine per use than his vape
    did. In fact, his 6-milligram Zyn has 100 times more nicotine than the 0.06-milligram
    puff of a vape.

    probably worse in that they were way stronger,” Smith said. “They have more nicotine

    attempted to quit several times. However, each time she tried to quit, she would
    eventually pick it back up a few months later if she was at a party and one of
    her friends brought out their vape.

    these nicotine pouches were better than vaping — and healthier, too.

    “Each time you do it, you gradually lose the buzz. And then finally it gets to
    the point where you’re just addicted and not even getting the buzz anymore. With
    Zyns, you feel the same constant buzz the whole time it’s in your mouth. Every
    time.”

    to things like memory loss or having trouble concentrating, and more easily addicted
    to nicotine or other drugs including alcohol. And the younger you are when you
    start using nicotine products, the more likely it is that you’ll become addicted
    to vaping or cigarettes in the future.”

    two months ago to gradually quit vaping. He had more difficulty with aerobic exercises
    like running and realized that he needed to quit nicotine. However now that he
    doesn’t use his vape as much as he used to, he needs to satisfy his withdrawals
    somehow. That’s where Zyn comes in.
