    agent in fireworks, and is a common component in rocket fuels, explosives and
    certain nitrogen fertilizers. At high levels in drinking water, perchlorate can
    interfere with the function of the human thyroid gland. However, the drinking
    water at Mount Rushmore meets current regulations and is safe for public consumption.

- en: Aerial fireworks displays took place at the memorial around the 1998-2009 Independence
    Days. The USGS and National Park Service studied perchlorate and metals associated
    with fireworks in 106 water and 11 soil samples taken from Mount Rushmore during
    2011-2015\. Perchlorate concentrations were greatest in samples collected from
    the northeast side of the memorial, and the scientists found perchlorate in soil
    where the fireworks were launched and where the debris landed.

    site or agricultural land with applied fertilizers, and the presence of firework
    debris suggest that past fireworks are the perchlorate source,” said Galen Hoogestraat,
    a USGS scientist and the lead author of the report. “Our results can help park
    managers protect water quality at this iconic national landmark.”

- en: A maximum perchlorate concentration of 54 micrograms per liter (µg/L) measured
    in a stream sample, and 38 µg/L measured from a groundwater well. In contrast,
    all groundwater and stream samples collected from sites outside the memorial boundary
    had perchlorate concentrations less than 0.2 µg/L.

    the memorial, indicating little evidence of metal contamination due to human-made
    factors.

    of the perchlorate because perchlorate is not a component of dynamite formulations.

- en: Drinking water is provided to about 3 million visitors to the memorial every
    year and to year-round park personnel. Perchlorate in drinking water is not currently
    regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but the park has planned
    for additional voluntary monitoring and treatment.

    and exceeds current standards,” said Cheryl Schreier, the Mount Rushmore National
    Memorial superintendent. “The USGS was an excellent partner committed to sound
    science throughout the process of sampling, analyzing, reviewing and finalizing
    the report and findings. The park is committed to ensuring the safety of the public
    and all of our employees, and preserving and protecting the natural and cultural
    resources with which we are entrusted.”
