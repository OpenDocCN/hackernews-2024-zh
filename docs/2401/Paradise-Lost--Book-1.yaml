- en: 'This first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole Subject, Mans disobedience,
    and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was plac''t: Then touches the prime
    cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who revolting
    from God, and drawing to his side many Legions of Angels, was by the command of
    God driven out of Heaven with all his Crew into the great Deep. Which action past
    over, the Poem hasts into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels
    now fallen into Hell, describ''d here, not in the Center (for Heaven and Earth
    may be suppos''d as yet not made, certainly not yet accurst) but in a place of
    utter darkness, fitliest call''d Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the
    burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as
    from confusion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer
    of thir miserable fall. Satan awakens all his Legions, who lay till then in the
    same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief Leaders
    nam''d, according to the Idols known afterwards in Canaan and the Countries adjoyning.
    To these Satan directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven,
    but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created, according
    to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven; for that Angels were long before
    this visible Creation, was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the
    truth of this Prophesie, and what to determin thereon he refers to a full Councel.
    What his Associates thence attempt. Pandemonium the Palace of Satan rises, suddenly
    built out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in Councel.'
