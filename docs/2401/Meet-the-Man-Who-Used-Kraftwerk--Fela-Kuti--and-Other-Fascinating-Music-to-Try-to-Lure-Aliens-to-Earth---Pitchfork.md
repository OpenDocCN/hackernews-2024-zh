# Meet the Man Who Used Kraftwerk, Fela Kuti, and Other Fascinating Music to Try to Lure Aliens to Earth | Pitchfork

When NASA launched the Voyager spacecrafts to explore the cosmos in 1977, they sent along [the Golden Record](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1445-meet-ann-druyan-the-woman-who-sent-chuck-berry-and-beethoven-into-space/)—and with it, music from around the world—as a snapshot of humanity, should intelligent lifeforms ever find it. But what if the aliens tuned in to the radio instead?

From 1971 to 1998, a man named John Shepherd probed that hypothetical question with astonishing dedication. Aiming for interstellar contact, he beamed everything from reggae to Steve Reich straight from his grandparents’ living room in rural Michigan, broadcasting between six to eight hours every day. He then expanded his operation—called Project STRAT—into a separate building on his grandparents’ property, complete with scientific equipment of his own design. Though Shepherd eventually ended the radio arm of Project STRAT due to the high cost of maintenance, he is now the subject of a touching new short film, *John Was Trying to Contact Aliens*, which [recently arrived on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81252991).

Shepherd saw music as a way to invite extraterrestrials to connect—to pique their curiosity and draw them close enough to Earth that he could study them. Much of the music he selected was boundary-pushing and globally minded. Albums like jazz-piano legend [Keith Jarrett](https://pitchfork.com/artists/15745-keith-jarrett/)’s *Mysteries*, *Give Me Power!* by the roots reggae group the Itals, the krautrock classic *[Future Days](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11699-future-days-soon-over-babaluma-unlimited-edition-landed/)* by [Can](https://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/), and a late-’70s [Fela Kuti](https://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/) compilation make cameos in the documentary when Shepherd shows off his extensive record collection. He was particularly drawn to instrumental music for his broadcasts, which he organized into hourly programming blocks. These shows varied in theme and tone, but they often delved deep into styles like early electronic music, exploratory jazz, and the ringing percussive music of Indonesian gamelan ensembles.

There is a certain logic to these choices. “You don’t need to translate if something can be felt through the soul, through the mind,” Shepherd tells me over the phone from his home near Kewadin, Michigan. “There’s always that twilight zone in between reality and music that allows you a certain imaginary landscape—you can go there and figure things out, or just sort of relax and cruise with flow.” Though he never made contact with extraterrestrials, he still managed to transmit traces of the unknown through the strange, beautiful music he broadcast.

Pitchfork: Did you start the project from the perspective of a music fan, or did the music aspect of it come later?

John Shepherd: I started putting together the equipment to do research into the phenomenon [of extraterrestrial life]. But then I realized that I should send something out to draw their attention and get them closer to the lab, where we had instruments to measure energy missions and stuff like that. The music influence came from a close friend, Mike Johnston, who had a huge collection of 4,000 or more vinyl LPs. It was everything from early progressive British rock to more spacey music like [Harmonia](https://pitchfork.com/artists/8797-harmonia/), [Cluster](https://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/), [Neu!](https://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/), and a lot of acoustic music groups. Music from Bali, music from India, and music from around the entire world. Thanks to him, I got to hear stuff that most people never heard on the radio, at least in this country.

How did you go about building your DJ sets?

Everything was done on the fly. Whatever happened to be that evening’s broadcasts, I would select music in that area and then with the flow. I would start out, say, with [Kraftwerk](https://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/) and maybe move on to [Tangerine Dream](https://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/) and then Harmonia—a lot of progressive, creative groups. Or I would be doing jazz, so maybe I’d start with [Ornette Coleman](https://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/) and go into [Charlie Parker](https://pitchfork.com/artists/charlie-parker/) and then Lee Morgan, following along that kind of line.
