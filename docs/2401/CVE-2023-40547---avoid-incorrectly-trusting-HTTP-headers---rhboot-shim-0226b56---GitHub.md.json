["```\nWhen retrieving files via HTTP or related protocols, shim attempts to\nallocate a buffer to store the received data.  Unfortunately, this means\ngetting the size from an HTTP header, which can be manipulated to\nspecify a size that's smaller than the received data.  In this case, the\ncode accidentally uses the header for the allocation but the protocol\nmetadata to copy it from the rx buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds\nwrite.\n\nThis patch adds an additional check to test that the rx buffer is not\nlarger than the allocation.\n\nResolves: CVE-2023-40547\nReported-by: Bill Demirkapi, Microsoft Security Response Center\nSigned-off-by: Peter Jones <pjones@redhat.com>\n```"]
