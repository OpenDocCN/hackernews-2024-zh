    [WINE 9.0 was released](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0)
    on Tuesday, almost a year after [we reported on WINE 8.0](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/03/wine_80_dxvk_21/)
    and two years after we [reported on WINE 7.0](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/19/wine_7/).

    those previous installments. Internally, it ["thunks"](https://blogs.stonesteps.ca/1/p/20)
    32-bit Windows API calls to 64-bit ones before it translates them to Unix API
    calls, which the developers call WoW64 after the [Windows feature of the same
    name](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog64/wow64-implementation-details).

    still include support for 32-bit libraries and programs… but all the big players
    are looking at dropping that. Canonical considered [dropping 32-bit app support
    from Ubuntu](https://www.theregister.com/2019/06/24/steam_wine_ubuntu_32_bit/)
    in 2019, but backtracked. Fedora [is still evaluating it](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/10/fedora_inches_closer_to_dropping/).
    It is very likely that Debian's next release, [version 13 "Trixie" will have no
    x86-32 edition](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/19/debian_to_drop_x86_32/),
    and [FreeBSD 15 won't either](https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/24/freebsd_14_rc2/).

    The last release of macOS 10, [10.15 "Catalina"](https://www.theregister.com/2019/10/08/adobe_catalina/)
    dropped 32-bit support back in 2019, and none of the five versions since support
    x86-32 code.

    which can even [be called from within Linux VMs](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/09/apple_linux_support_macos/).
    Folks running Linux on Arm64 will have to provide their own, but the Wine developers
    point at [FEX-Emu](https://fex-emu.com/) for this.

    display protocol:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Much like 32-bit binary support, most Wayland-based distros still support X.11
    apps via XWayland, but a direct Wayland rendering path helps performance. That
    matters to gamers, streamers, and those working with video, and thanks to Valve's
    hard work on SteamOS, [the performance of Windows apps on Linux](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/27/osseu_steam_os_3/)
    is improving rapidly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are lots of other changes in this release. Also improved are Postscript
    handling, 3D graphics, audio and video handling, desktop integration, support
    for `MSHTML` rendering via Gecko, Mon and .NET support, and more.

- en: 'However, you should note that both the 64-bit-only and Wayland support, two
    of the key features, remain optional: you can use them in the stable release version,
    but you will have to explicitly enable them. The stable releases of WINE are cautious
    things, and mostly, its default settings avoid enabling things which might conceivably
    break anything for anyone. *Wine-Stable* is the version you will generally find
    in your Linux distro''s repositories.'

    a separate branch, called [Wine-Staging](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine-Staging).
    If even that isn't fresh enough for you, there is also the `-development` branch,
    which gets a new release about every two weeks, as the [WineHQ FAQ](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_User's_Guide#Wine_from_WineHQ)
    describes.

    check the [Wine Application Database](https://appdb.winehq.org/) first. There
    are also helper apps that make it easier to get stuff running, such as the [Winetricks
    helper script](https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks) which can automatically install
    needed Windows dependencies for specific apps.

    and work – or you want to financially support WINE development – then [as it has
    for decades](https://www.theregister.com/2011/01/29/codeweavers_impersonator/),
    CodeWeavers' CrossOver makes it much easier… on Linux, on ChromeOS, and [on Macs
    as well](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/19/crossover_apple_m1/). ®
