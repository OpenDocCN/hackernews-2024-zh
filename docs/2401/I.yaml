    Huxley[[1](#f1)] gave such publicity in his Belfast address; which the late Mr.
    D. A. Spalding punctiliously made the pivot of all his book-notices in *Nature;*
    which Prof. Clifford fulminated as a dogma essential to salvation in a lecture
    on "Body and Mind"[[2](#f2)] but which found its earliest and ablest exposition
    in Mr. Hodgson's magnificent work, *The Theory of Practice*.[[3](#f3)] The theory
    maintains that in everything outward we are pure material machines.  Feeling is
    a mere collateral product of our nervous processes, unable to react upon them
    any more than a shadow reacts on the steps of the traveller whom it accompanies.  Inert,
    uninfluential, a simple passenger in the voyage of life, it is allowed to remain
    on board, but not to touch the helm or handle the rigging.

    awaken each other by inward congruity or rational necessity, that disappointed
    hopes *cause* sadness, premisses conclusions, &c.  The feelings are merely juxtaposed
    in that order without mutual cohesion, because the nerve-processes to which they
    severally correspond awaken each other in that order. [p. 2]

    who Like Prof. Huxley have openly expressed their belief in Hume's doctrine of
    causality.  That doctrine asserts that the causality we seem to find between the
    terms of a physical chain of events, is an illegitimate outward projection of
    the inward necessity by which we feel each thought to sprout out of its customary
    antecedent.  Strip the string of necessity from between ideas themselves, and
    it becomes hard indeed for a Humian[*sic*] to say how the notion of causality
    ever was born at all.

    theory itself is an inevitable consequence of the extension of the notion of reflex
    action to the higher nerve-centres.  Prof. Huxley starts from a decapitated frog
    which performs rational-seeming acts although probably it has no consciousness,
    and passing up to the hemispheres of man concludes that the rationality of their
    performances can owe nothing to the feelings that co-exist with it.  This is the
    inverse of Mr. Lewes's procedure.  He starts from the hemispheres, and finding
    their performances apparently  guided by feeling concludes, when he comes to the
    spinal cord, that feeling though latent must still be there to make it act so
    rationally.  Clearly such arguments as these may mutually eat each other up to
    all eternity.

    subject, seems due to a sort of philosophic faith, bred like most faiths from
    an aesthetic demand.  Mental and physical events are, on all hands, admitted to
    present the strongest contrast in the entire field of being. The chasm which yawns
    between them is less easily bridged over by the mind than any interval we know.  Why
    then not call it an absolute chasm? And say not only that the two worlds are different,
    but that they are independent? This gives us the comfort of all simple and absolute
    formulas, and it makes each chain homogeneous to our consideration. When talking
    of nervous tremors and bodily actions, we may feel secure against intrusion from
    an irrelevant mental world. When, on the other hand, we speak of feelings, we
    may with equal consistency use terms always of one denomination, and never be
    annoyed by what Aristotle calls "slipping into another kind". The desire on the
    part of men educated in laboratories not to have their physical reasonings mixed
    up with such incommensurable factors as feelings is certainly very strong. Nothing
    is commoner than to hear them speak of conscious events as something so essentially
    vague and shadowy as even doubtfully to exist at all.  I have heard a most intelligent
    [p. 3] biologist say: "It is high time for scientific men to protest against the
    recognition of any such thing as consciousness in a scientific investigation".  In
    a word, feeling constitutes the "unscientific" half of existence, and any one
    who enjoys calling himself a "scientist" will be too happy to purchase an untrammeled
    homogeneity of terms in the studies of his predilection, at the slight cost of
    admitting a dualism which, in the same breath that it allows to mind an independent
    status of being, banishes it to a limbo of causal inertness, from whence no intrusion
    or interruption on its part need ever be feared.'

    craving for unity. The spectacle of an ultimate and inexplicable dualism in the
    nature of things may be as unsatisfying as the obligation to calculate with heterogeneous
    terms.  Two "aspects," *nemine* *adspiciente,* seem uncalled for.  One may well
    refuse, until absolutely overpowered by the evidence, to believe that the world
    contains items which in no wise influence their neighbours; whose existence or
    non-existence need, so far as the remainder go, be taken into no account.  It
    is a smoother and more harmonious thought to imagine all the items of the world
    without exception as interlocked in bonds of action and reaction, and forming
    a single dynamic whole.

    is, then, that neither sthetic motives nor ostensible reasons entitle us to decide
    between the Conscious-Automaton-theory and the theory of Common Sense.  Both alike

    at its maximum in the hypertrophied cerebrum of man, the natural inference is

    higher animals, what strikes us most in them is the determinateness with which
    they respond to a given stimulus.  The addition of the cerebral hemispheres immediately
    introduces a certain incalculableness into the result, and this incalculableness
    attains its maximum with the relatively enormous brain-convolutions of man.  In
    the beheaded frog the legs twitch as fatally when we touch the skin with acid
    as do a jumping-jack's when we pull the string.  The machinery is as narrow and
    perfect in the one case as in the other.  Even if all the centres above the cord
    except the cerebral hemispheres are left in place, the machine-like regularity
    of the animal's response is hardly less striking.  He breathes, he swallows, he
    crawls, he turns over from his back, he moves up or down on his support, he swims
    and stops at a given moment, he croaks, he leaps forward two or three times --
    each and all with almost unerring regularity at my word of command, provided I
    only be an experienced physiologist and know what ganglia to leave and what particular
    spur will elicit the action I desire. Thus if I merely remove his hemispheres
    and tilt my hand down, he will crawl up it but not jump off. If I pinch him under
    the arm-pits, he will croak once for each pinch; if I throw him into water, he
    will swim until I touch his hands with a stick, when he will immediately stop.  Over
    a frog with an entire brain, the physiologist has no such power.  The signal may
    be given, but ideas, emotions or caprices will be aroused instead of the fatal
    motor reply, and whether the animal will leap, croak, sink or swim or swell up
    without moving, is impossible to predict.  In a man's brain the utterly remote
    and unforeseen courses of action to which a given impression on the senses may
    give rise, is too notorious to need illustration.  Whether we notice it at all
    depends on our mental pre-occupations at the moment.  If we do notice it, our
    [p. 5] action again depends on the "considerations" which it awakens, and these
    again may depend as much on our transient mood or on our latest experience as
    on any constant tendencies organised in our nature.

    of the brain are those whose action are least determinate.  It is this very vagueness
    which constitutes their advantage.  They allow their possessor to adapt his conduct
    to the minutest alterations in the environing circumstances, any one of which
    may be for him a sign, suggesting distant motives more powerful than any present
    solicitations of sense. Now it seems as if certain mechanical conclusions should
    be drawn from this state of things.  An organ swayed by slight impressions is
    an organ whose natural state is one of unstable equilibrium. We may imagine the
    various lines of discharge in the cerebrum to be almost on a par in point of permeability
    -- what discharge a given small impression will produce may be called accidental,
    in the sense in which we say it is a matter of accident whether a rain-drop falling
    on a mountain ridge descend the eastern or the western slope.  It is in this sense
    that we may call it a matter of accident whether a woman's first child be a boy
    or a girl.  The ovum is so unstable a body that certain causes too minute for
    our apprehension may at a certain moment tip it one way or the other. The natural
    law of an organ constituted after this fashion can be nothing but a law of caprice.  I
    do not see how one could reasonably expect from it any certain pursuance of useful
    lines of reaction such as the few and fatally determined performances of the lower
    centres constitute within their narrow sphere.  The dilemma in regard to the nervous
    system seems to be of the following kind. We may construct one which will react
    infallibly and certainly, but it will then be capable of reacting to very few
    changes in the environment -- it will fail to be adapted to all the rest. We may,
    on the other hand, construct a nervous system potentially adapted to respond to
    an infinite variety of minute features in the situation; but its fallibility will
    then be as great as its elaboration.  We can never be sure that its equilibrium
    will be upset in the appropriate direction.  In short, a high brain may do many
    things, and may do each of them at a very slight hint.  But its hair-trigger organisation
    makes of it a happy-go-lucky, hit-or-miss affair. It is as likely to do the crazy
    as the sane thing at any given moment. A low brain does few things, and in doing
    them perfectly forfeits all other use. The performances of a high brain are like
    dice thrown for ever on a table.  Unless they be loaded, what chance is there
    that the highest number will turn up oftener than the lowest? [p. 6]

    clearly apprehend the import of such expressions as *useful discharge, appropriate
    direction, right reaction,* and the like, which we have been using.  They all
    presuppose some Good, End or Interest to be the animal's. Until this goal of his
    salvation be posited, we have no criterion by which to estimate the utility of
    any of his reactions. Now the important thing to notice is that the goal cannot
    be posited at all so long as we consider the purely physical order of existence.  Matter
    has no ideals.  It must be entirely indifferent to the molecules of C, H, N and
    O, whether they combine in a live body or a dead one.  What the present conditions
    fatally necessitate that they do with equal infallibility and cheerfulness; whether
    the result of their action be the perfume of a rose or the odour of carrion, the
    words of a Renouvier or the crackling of thorns under a pot, it is brought forth
    with as little reluctance in the one case as in the other.  Good involves the
    notion of less good, necessitates comparison, and for a drop of water either to
    compare its present state with an absent state or to compare its total self with
    a drop of wine, would involve a process not commonly thought of as physical.  Comparison
    requires a *tertium* *quid,* a locus -- call it what you will -- in which the
    two outward existences may meet on equal terms. This forum is what is known as
    a consciousness. Even sensations cannot be supposed, simply as such, to be aware
    of their relations to each other.  A succession of feelings is not (as James Mill
    reiterates) one and the same thing with a feeling of succession, but a wholly
    different thing.  The latter feeling requires a self-transcendency of each item,
    so that each not only *is* in relation, but knows its relation, to the other.
    This self-transcendency of data constitutes the conscious form.  Where we suppose
    it to exist we have mind; where mind exists we have it.

    or survival is the essential or universal good for all living things. The mechanical
    processes of "spontaneous variation" and "natural selection" bring about this
    good by their combined action; but being physical processes they can in no sense
    be said to intend it.  It merely floats off here and there accidentally as one
    of a thousand other physical results.  The followers of Darwin rightly scorn those
    teleologists who claim that the physical process, as such; of evolution follows
    an ideal of perfection.  But now suppose that not only our Darwinian consciousness,
    but with even greater energy the [p. 8] consciousness of the creature itself,
    postulates survival as its *summum* *bonum,* and by its cognitive faculty recognises
    as well as Mr. Darwin which of its actions and functions subserves this good;
    would not the addition of causal efficacy to this consciousness enable it to furnish
    forth the means as well as fix the end -- make it teleologically a fighter as
    well as a standard-bearer?  Might not, in other words, such a consciousness promote
    or increase by its function of efficacity the amount of that "usefulness" on the
    part of the brain which it defines and estimates by its other functions?  To answer

    of the most acute and emphatic of all is that of Ulrici, who in his *Leib* *und
    Seele* and elsewhere exactly reverses the formula of the reigning British school,
    by calling consciousness a discriminating activity -- an *Unterscheidungsvermgen*.
    But even Ulrici does not pretend that consciousness creates the differences it
    becomes aware of in its objects.  They pre-exist and consciousness only discerns
    them; so that after all Ulrici's definition amounts to little more than saying
    that consciousness is a faculty of cognition -- a rather barren result.  I think
    we may go farther and add that the powers of cognition, discrimination and comparison
    which it possesses, exist only for the sake of something beyond themselves, namely,
    Selection.  Whoever studies consciousness, from any point of view whatever, is
    ultimately brought up against the mystery of *interest* and *selective attention.*
    There [p. 9] are a great many things which consciousness *is* in a passive and
    receptive way by its cognitive and registrative powers. But there is one thing
    which it *does, su sponte,* and which seems an original peculiarity of its own;
    and that is, always to choose out of the manifold experiences present to it at
    a given time some one for particular accentuation, and to ignore the the [*sic*]
    rest.  And I shall now show how, from its simplest to its most complicated forms;
    it exerts this function with unremitting industry.

    says is the lowest stage of mentality. What are our senses themselves but organs
    of selection?  Out of the infinite chaos of movements, of which physics teaches
    us that the outer world consists, each sense-organ picks out those which fall
    within certain limits of velocity.  To these it responds, but ignores the rest
    as completely as if they did not exist.  It thus accentuates particular movements
    in a manner for which objectively there seems no valid ground; for, as Lange says,
    there is no reason whatever to think that the gap in nature between the highest
    sound-waves and the lowest heat-waves is an abrupt break like that of our sensations,
    or that the difference between violet and ultra-violet rays has anything like
    the objective importance subjectively represented by that between light and darkness.  Out
    of what is in itself an undistinguishable, swarming *continuum,* devoid of distinction

    we avert our attention are those which are valueless as tokens of the presence
    of objective things. These *things* are called the Objects of perception. But
    what are *they?* Nothing, as it seems to me, but groups of coherent sensations.  This
    is no place to criticise Helmholtz''s treatment of perception, but I may say,
    in passing that I think his rather indefinite and oracular statements about the
    part played by the intellect therein have momentarily contributed to retard psychological
    inquiry.  We find the Kantian philosophers everywhere hailing him as the great
    experimental corroborator of their master''s views.  They say he has proved the
    present sensation to have nothing to do with the construction of the Object that
    is an original act of the intellect which the sensation merely instigates but
    does not furnish forth: it contains ultra-sensational elements.  All that Helmholtz
    really *does* prove is, that the so-called Object is constituted of *absent* sensations.  What
    he has not explicitly noticed is, that among these the mind picks out certain
    particular ones to be more essential and characteristic than the rest.  When,
    for example, on getting a peculiar retinal sensation with two acute and two obtuse
    angles, I *perceive* a square table-top, which thus contradicts my present image;
    what is the *squareness*but one out of an infinite number of possible retinal
    sensations which the same object may yield?  From all these the mind, for sthetic
    reasons of its own, has singled out this one and chosen to call it the object''s
    essential attribute?  Were room here given, I think it might be shown that perception
    involves nothing beyond association and selection.  The antithesis is not, as
    Helmholtz''s admirers would have it, between sensations on the one hand as signs
    and original intellectual products, materially different from [p. 11] sensations
    on the other, as Objects.  It is between present sensations as signs and certain
    absent sensations as Objects, these latter being moreover arbitrarily selected
    out of a large number as being more objective and real than the rest.  The real
    form of the circle is deemed to be the sensation it gives when the line of vision
    is perpendicular to its centre -- all its other sensations are signs of this sensation.  The
    real sound of the cannon is the sensation it makes when the ear is close by.  The
    real colour of the brick. is the sensation it gives when the eye looks squarely
    at it from a near point, out of the sunshine and yet not in the gloom; under other
    circumstances it gives us other colour-sensations which are not signs of this
    -- we then see it looks pinker or blacker than it really is.  The reader knows
    no object which he does not represent to himself by preference as in some typical
    attitude, of some normal size, at some characteristic distance, of some standard
    tint, &c., &c.  But all these essential characteristics, which together form the
    genuine objectivity of the thing and are contrasted with the subjective sensations
    we may happen to get from it at a given moment, are themselves sensations pure
    and simple, susceptible of being fully given at *some* other moment.  The spontaneity
    of the mind does not consist in conjuring up any new non-sensational quality of
    objectivity.  It consists solely in deciding what the particular sensation shall
    be whose native objectivity shall be held more valid than that of all the rest.[[7](#f7)]'

    Europe. One will bring home only picturesque impressions-costumes and colours,
    parks and views and works of architecture, pictures and statues. To another all
    this will be non-existent; and distances and prices, populations and drainage-arrangements,
    door- and window-fastenings, and other useful statistics will take their place  A
    third will give a rich account of the theatres, restaurants, and public balls,
    and naught beside; whilst the fourth will perhaps have been so wrapped in his
    own subjective broodings as to tell little more than a few names of places through
    which he passed. Each has selected, out of the same mass of presented objects,
    those which suited his private interest and has made his experience thereby.

    *rationally* to connect them we find selection again to be omnipotent.  In an
    article on "Brute and Human Intellect " in the *Journal of Speculative Philosophy,*
    July 1878, p. 236 I have tried to show that all Reasoning depends on the ability
    of the mind to break up the totality of the phenomenon reasoned about into partial
    factors or elements, and to pick out from among these the particular one which,
    in our given theoretical or practical emergency, may lead to the proper conclusion.  Another
    predicament will need another conclusion, and require another element to be picked
    out.  The man of genius is he who will always stick-in his bill, as it were, at
    the right point, and bring it out with the right element -- "reason" if the emergency
    be theoretical, "means" if it be *practical-transfixed* upon it? Association by
    similarity I have shown to be an important help to this breaking-up of represented
    things into their elements.  But this association is only the minimum of that
    same selection of which picking out the right reason is a maximum.  I here confine
    myself to this brief statement, but it may suffice to show that Reasoning is but
    another form of that selective activity which appears to be the true sphere of
    mental spontaneity.

    supreme.  An act has no ethical quality whatever unless it be chosen out of several
    all equally possible.  To sustain the arguments for the good course and keep them
    ever before us, to stifle longing for more flowery ways, to keep the foot unflinchingly
    on the arduous path, these are characteristic ethical energies.  But, more than
    these; for these but deal with the means of compassing interests already felt
    by the man to be supreme.  The ethical energy *par excellence* has to go farther
    and choose which interest out of several equally coercive shall become supreme.
    The issue here is of the utmost pregnancy, for it decides a man's entire career.
    When he debates, Shall I commit this crime? choose that profession? accept that
    office, or marry this fortune? -- his choice really lies between one of several
    equally possible future *Selves.* What his entire empirical *Ego* shall become,
    is fixed by the conduct of this moment.  Schopenhauer, who enforces his determinism
    by the argument that with a given fixed character only one reaction is possible
    under given circumstances, forgets that, in these critical ethical moments, what
    consciously *seems* to be in question is the very complexion of the character.  The
    problem with the man is less what act he shall now choose to do, than what kind
    of a being he shall now resolve to become.

    theatre of simultaneous possibilities.  Consciousness consists in the comparison
    of these with each other, the selection of some, and the suppression of the rest
    by the reinforcing and inhibiting agency of attention.  The highest and most elaborated
    mental products are filtered from the data chosen by the faculty next beneath
    out of the mass offered by the faculty below that, which mass in turn was sifted
    from a still larger amount of yet simpler material, and so on.  The highest distillate
    thus *represents* in the last analysis nothing but sensational elements. But this
    is far from meaning that it implies nothing but passive faculty of sensation.  As
    well might one say that the sculptor is passive, because the statue stood from
    eternity within the stone.  So it did, but with a million different ones beside
    it.  The world as a Goethe feels and knows it all lay embedded in the primordial
    chaos of sensations, [p. 14] and into these elements we may analyse back every
    thought of the poet.  We may even, by our reasonings, unwind things back to that
    black and jointless continuity of space and moving clouds of swarming atoms which
    science calls the only real world.  But all the while the world we feel and live
    in, will be that which our ancestors and we, by slowly cumulative strokes of choice,
    have extricated out of this, as the sculptor extracts his statue by simply rejecting
    the other portions of the stone.  Other sculptors, other statues from the same
    stone! Other minds, other worlds from the same chaos!  Goethe's world is but one
    in a million alike embedded, alike real to those who may abstract them. Some such
    other worlds may exist in the consciousness of ant, crab and cuttle-fish.

    the unaided action of the cerebral hemispheres would probably be random and capricious;
    that the nerve-process likely to lead to the animal's interests would not necessarily
    predominate at a given moment. On the other hand, we have found that an impartial
    consciousness is a non-entity, and that of the many items that ever occupy our
    mental stage Feeling always selects one as most congruous with the interests it
    has taken its stand upon.  Collating these two results, an inference is unavoidable.
    The "items" on the mental stage are the subjective aspects of as many nerve-processes,
    and in emphasising the representations congruous with conscious interest and discouraging
    all others, may not Attention actually reinforce and inhibit the nerve-processes
    to which the representations severally correspond?

    analysis by which it has been reached gives it great plausibility.  I shall strengthen
    the probability by further facts in a moment.  But I beg the reader to notice
    here the limitations of the power of Feeling, if power there be.  All the possibilities
    of representation, all the images are furnished by the brain.  Consciousness produces
    nothing, it only alters the proportions.  Even the miraculous action of free will
    can only consist in the quantitative reinforcement of representations already
    given qualitatively.  A sonorous plate has no proper note of its own.  It is most
    impossible by scraping it to reproduce twice an identical tone.  The number of
    Chladni's sand-figures it will furnish is as inexhaustible as the whimsies which
    may turn up in a brain.  But as the physicist's finger pressing the plate here
    or there determines nodal points that throw the sand into shapes of relative fixity,  [p.
    15] so may the accentuating finger of consciousness deal with the fluctuating
    eddies in the cerebral cortex.

    dominant interests or present impressions seems manifest from the phenomena of
    dreaming.  The chaotic imagery there appears due to the unequal stimulus of nutrition
    in different localities.  But if an accidental variation in nutrition is sufficient
    to determine the brain's action, what safeguard have we at any time against its
    random influence? It may of course be reasonably objected that the exceptional
    state of sleep can afford no proper clue to the brain's operations when awake.  But
    Maury in his classic work, *Le Sommeil,* has conclusively proved the passage of
    dreams through "hypnagogic hallucinations" into that meteoric shower of images
    and suggestions, irrelevant to the main line of thought, the continual presence
    of which every one who has once had his *interest awakened* in the subject, will
    without difficulty recognise in himself.  Ordinarily these perish in being born,
    but if one by chance saunters into the mind, which *is* related to the dominant
    pursuit of the moment, presto! it is pounced upon and becomes part of the empirical
    *Ego.* The greatest inventions, the most brilliant thoughts often turn up thus
    accidentally, but may mould for all that the future of the man. Would they have
    gained this prominence above their peers without the watchful eye of consciousness
    to recognise their value and emphasise them into permanence?

    one of the strongest objections to the credibility of the Darwinian theory.  A
    consciousness which should not only determine its brain to prosperous courses,
    but also by virtue of that hereditary influence of habit  (nowadays so generally
    believed in by naturalists) should organise from generation to generation a nervous
    system more and more mechanically incapable of wandering from the lines of interest
    chosen for it at first, would immensely shorten the time and labour of natural
    selection.  Mr. Darwin regards animated nature as a sort of table on which dice
    are continually being thrown. No intention presides over the throwing, but lucky
    numbers from time to time fortuitously turn up and are preserved.  If the ideas
    we have advanced concerning the instability of a complicated cerebrum be true,
    we should have a sort of extension of this reign of accident into the functional
    life of [p. 16] every individual animal whose brain had become sufficiently evolved.  As
    his body morphologically was the result of lucky chance, so each of his so-called
    acts of intelligence would be another; and ages might elapse before out of this
    enormous lottery-game a brain should emerge both complex and secure. But give
    to consciousness the power of exerting a constant pressure in the direction of
    survival, and give to the organism the power of growing to the modes in which
    consciousness has trained it, and the number of stray shots is immensely reduced,
    and the time proportionally shortened for Evolution. It is, in fact, hard to see
    how without an effective superintending ideal the evolution of so unstable an
    organ as the mammalian cerebrum can have proceeded at all.

    consciousness has causal efficacity. It has long been noticed that pleasures are
    generally associated with beneficial, pains with detrimental, experiences.  All
    the fundamental vital processes illustrate this law. Starvation, suffocation,
    privation of food, drink and sleep, work when exhausted, burns, wounds, inflammation,
    the effects of poison, are as disagreeable as filling the hungry stomach, enjoying
    rest and sleep after fatigue, exercise after rest, and a sound skin and unbroken
    bones at all times, are pleasant. Mr. Spencer, in the chapter of his *Psychology*
    entitled "Pleasures and Pains," has suggested that these coincidences are due,
    not to any pre-established harmony, but to the mere action of natural selection
    which would certainly kill off in the long run any breed of creatures to whom
    the *fundamentally* noxious experience seemed enjoyable.  An animal that should
    take pleasure in a suffocation would, if that pleasure were efficacious make him
    immerse his head in water, enjoy a longevity of four or five minutes.  But if
    pleasures and pains have no efficacity, one does not see (without some such *[*sic*]
    *priori* rational harmony as would be scouted by the "scientific" champions of
    the Automaton-theory) why the most noxious acts, such as burning, might not give
    a thrill of delight, and the most necessary ones, such as breathing, cause agony.[[9](#f9)]  The
    exceptions to this law [p. 18] are, it is true, numerous, but relate to experiences
    that are either not vital or not universal.  Drunkenness, for instance, which
    though noxious is to many persons delightful, is a very exceptional experience.  But,
    as the excellent physiologist Fick remarks, if all rivers and springs ran alcohol-instead
    of water, either all men would hate it or our nerves would have been selected
    so as to drink it with impunity.  The only very considerable attempt, in fact,
    that has ever been made to explain the *distribution* of our feelings is that
    of Mr. Grant Allen in his suggestive little work *Physiological sthetics;* and
    his reasoning is based exclusively on that causal efficacity of pleasures and

    standard posited by Desire.  The standard of survival or self-preservation is
    most potent.  But there exist a host of other standards, aesthetic and moral,
    imperative so long as they do not conflict with this one and sometimes imperative
    over this one.  In the preliminary selection by the senses of certain objective
    orders of movement, it is difficult to see what standard [p. 19] is subserved.  The
    utility of not having a sense for magnetism when we have one for heat, is not
    obvious. We may at most suspect a possible sthetic brightness and clearness to
    result, from the wide intervals. But passing by this obscure region we see without
    the least difficulty why we ignore those ingredients of sensation which are not
    signs of things. What the peculiarity is in itself which makes Smith''s voice
    so different from Brown''s,we need never inquire so long as whenever we hear it
    we say, "There is Smith". For our practical interest in recognising whom we have
    to deal with outweighs our interest in the shades of sound *per se*. The selection
    again of certain attitudes, expressions, &c., in Smith, to stand as characteristic
    of him so that when others are present we say, "He does not look like himself,"
    and if he is sitting to us for his portrait we spend an hour perhaps in placing
    him and lighting him so as to bring out with the utmost clearness these selected
    traits -- this selection, I say, is equally explicable by various sthetic standards,
    permanency simplicity, harmony, clearness, and the like.  Passing now from traits
    to *things,* the utility of selection is obviously created and measured by the
    interests the man has made his own. If Edward never walks out without finding
    a four-leafed clover, while Oliver dies of old age without having seen one, this
    is merely due to the fact that Edward has somehow been led to stake his happiness
    on that particular branch of discovery, and out of a visual field identical with
    that of Oliver has picked the details that minister to this somewhat arbitrary
    interest.  Granted the interest, we cannot deny the use of the picking-out power.  That
    Edward, having this interest in common with many others, should finally succeed
    in emphasising certain of those others and suppressing this, would be an example
    of the utility of selection in the ethical field, supposing always that the new
    interest chosen were of a higher order and not, like making puns, for example,
    as trivial an end as the one forsaken.'

    universally recognised.  But it is not so commonly known how, when the interest
    is once fixed upon, the selective activity must ceaselessly work to detect its
    presence or absence in each emergency that turns up.  Take, for example, an inebriate
    struggling with temptation.  The glass is before him, and the act of drinking
    has an infinity of aspects and may be defined in as many ways.  If he selected
    the aspect of its helping him to write an article, of its being only lager-beer,
    of its being the fourth of July, of his needing it as medicine, of his never having

    its giving him the strength to make a much more powerful resolution for the future
    than any of his [p. 20] previous ones, or whatever other sophistries his appetite
    may instigate, he does but accentuate some character really contained in the act,
    but needing this emphasising pressure of his attention to be erected into its
    essence.  But if, out of all the teeming suggestions with which the liquor before
    him inspires his brain, respectively saying, "It is a case of this good, of that
    interest, of yonder end," his mind pounces on one which repeats, "*It is essentially
    a case of drunkenness!"* and never lets that go, his stroke of classification
    becomes his deed of virtue.  The power of choosing the light name for the case

    counter to the selective pressure of consciousness.  Every day of our lives we
    struggle to escape some tedious tune or odious thought which the momentary disposition
    of the brain keeps forcing upon us.  And, to take more extreme cases, there are
    murderous tendencies to nervous discharge which, so far from involving by their

    for solution.  I feel even more strongly than Professors Huxley and Clifford that
    the only *rational nexus* is that of identity, and that feeling  and  nerve-tremor
    are disparate.  I feel too that those who smile at the idea of calling consciousness
    an "organ," on a par with other organs, may be moved by a fundamentally right
    instinct. And I moreover feel that that unstable equilibrium of the cerebrum which
    forms the pivot of the argument just finished may, with better knowledge, be found
    perfectly compatible with an average appropriateness of its actions taken in the
    long run.  But with all these concessions made, I still believe the Common-Sense-theory
    to merit our present credence.  Fragmentary probabilities supported by the study
    of details are more worthy of trust than any mere universal conceptions, however
    tempting their simplicity. Science has won all her credit by the former kind of
    reasoning, Metaphysics has lost hers by the latter.  The impossibility of motion,
    of knowledge, either subjective or objective, are proved by arguments as good
    as that which denies causality to feeling, because of its disparity with its effects.  It
    is really monstrous to see the *prestige* of "Science" invoked for a materialistic
    conclusion, reached by methods which, were they only used for spiritualistic ends,
    would be booted at as antiscientific in the extreme.  Our argument, poor as it
    is, has kept at any rate upon the plane of concrete facts. Its circumstantial
    evidence can hardly be upset until the Automaton-theorists shall have condescended
    to make or invoke some new discoveries of detail which shall oblige us to reinterpret
    the facts we already know. But in that case I feel intimately persuaded that the
    reinterpretation will be so wide as to transform the Automaton-theory as thoroughly
    as the popular one.  The Automaton-theory in its present  state contents itself
    with a purely negative deliverance.  There is a chasm, it says, between feeling
    and act.  Consciousness is impotent.  It exists, to be sure, but all those *manners*
    of existence which make it seem relevant to our outward life are mere meaningless
    coincidences, inexplicable parts of the general and intimate irrationality of

    Spencer one might easily show how the differentiation of sense-organs arose in
    the primitive polyp through this reinforcement by'' a selective attention (supposed
    efficacious) of particular portions of the feeling yielded by an organ already
    nascent.  The integument of the animal might, for instance, at first be affected
    both by light-vibrations and by those far below them. But if the former were picked
    out by the consciousness as most interesting, the nervous movements world soon
    grow more and more harmonious with them, and more and more out of tune with the
    rest. Anoptic nerve and retina would thus result.  One might corroborate this
    reasoning by pointing to what happens in cases of squint.  The squinting eye gives
    double images which are so inconvenient that the mind is forced to abstract its
    attention from them.  This resolute refusal to attend to the sensations of one
    eye soon makes it totally blind. It would seem, indeed, that the attention positively
    suppressed the function of the retina, for the presence of cataract which keeps
    the image from It altogether, results in no such paralysis.  I do not insist on
    this point, partly because such speculation is rather cheap -- "all may raise
    the flowers now, for all have got the seed" -- and partly because there seems
    some reason to doubt whether the usually received explanation of strabismic  blindness
    be correct.**'

- en: '**[7] When I say Objects are wholly formed of associated and selected sensations,
    I hope the reader will not understand me to profess adhesion to the old atomic
    doctrine of association, so thoroughly riddled of late by Professor Green.  The
    association of sensations of which I speak, presupposes comparison and memory
    which are functions not given in any one sensation. All I mean is, that these
    mental functions are already at work in the first beginnings of sensation and
    that the simplest changes of sensation moreover involve consciousness of all the
    categories -- time, space, number, objectivity,causality.  There is not first
    a passive act of sensation proper, followed by an active production or projection
    ("inference") of the attributes of objectivity by the mind.  These all come to
    us together with the sensible qualities, and their progress from vagueness to
    distinctness is the only process psychologists have to explain.  What I mean to
    say in the text is, that this process involves nothing but association and selection,
    all new production of either material or formal elements being denied.'

    it would he dangerous to urge too dogmatically. It may be that restitution of
    cerebral function is susceptible of explanation on drainage-principles, or, to

    breathing.  It, like other motor processes, results from a tendency to nervous
    discharge. When this takes place immediately, hardly any feeling but the rather
    negative one of ease results. When, however, a nervous discharge is checked it
    is a universal law that consciousness of a disagreeable kind is awakened, reaching
    in the case of suffocation the extremity of agony. An Automatist may then say
    that feeling here, so far from playing a dynamic part, is a mere passive index
    or symptom of certain mechanical happenings; and if here, then elsewhere. It may
    be replied that even were this true of completely habitual acts like breathing
    where the nervous paths have been thoroughly organised for generations, it need
    not be true of hesitant acts not yet habitual; it need not be true of pains and
    pleasures, such as hunger and sleep, *not* connected with motor discharge; and
    even in the instance chosen it leaves out the possibility that the nervous mechanism,
    now automatically perfect, may have become so by slowly organised habit acquired
    under the guidance of conscious feeling.'
