    And Other Career Advice](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)".

  zh: 麦肯齐列出了不做的合理理由。就工作满意度而言，他说你可以在大公司里做许多令人兴奋的事情，不仅仅是初创公司。
- en: Here's one thing in favor of startups. A large corporation usually doesn't have
    huge gaping holes that it doesn't know how to deal with or doesn't even notice.
    A startup often does have many such gaping holes, because, well, nothing is established
    yet, they don't even understand what they're doing, and most importantly, they
    are severely understaffed.

  zh: 以下是支持初创公司的一点。大公司通常不会有它不知道如何处理或甚至没有注意到的巨大漏洞。初创公司通常会有许多这样的巨大漏洞，因为，嗯，还没有建立，他们甚至不了解自己在做什么，最重要的是，他们严重人手不足。
- en: This means that you can grab pretty much any responsibility that you want to.
    There will be areas that people are competing to work on everywhere, but in a
    startup doing something hard enough, there will be a ton of hard problems nobody
    is competing to solve because there's not enough time or people for everything.
    You can be the person pointing out that problem and grabbing that responsibility.

  zh: 这意味着你可以拿起几乎任何你想要的责任。人们到处都在争夺要解决的问题，但在初创公司做一些足够困难的事情时，会有大量的困难问题没有人竞争去解决，因为没有足够的时间或人手做所有事情。你可以成为指出问题并承担责任的人。
- en: As companies mature, being able to just work on whatever you want gets harder.
    My metaphor for it is [nomadic programmers](http://www.yosefk.com/blog/the-nomadic-programmer.html)
    moving from problem to problem vs settlers with states and national borders where
    even visiting your neighbor's code may involve a visa.

- en: This isn't a recommendation to work for startups, just one thing worth pointing
    out. The counterpoint is that if you're an orderly person who wants an orderly
    process, then a larger company known for its development culture is probably a
    better idea.

- en: On the other hand, we do spend quite some time at work. The question is, to
    what extent does it make sense to separate "work" from "life" – and to what extent

    of life?

- en: I argue that the "work/life" separation shouldn't be strong enough to separate
    "coworkers" into a distinct category of human beings with whom relationships are

- en: (I'm not arguing that McKenzie's intent was to say the exact opposite of what
    I'm saying, BTW. I'm just commenting on some quotes and the general atmosphere
    of the text as I perceived it. A lot of things simply have different meaning when
    heard by different people; a simple advice like "be wary of others' intentions"
    is great for someone overly trusting, but not for someone already verging on paranoia.
    Some people need to hear that coworkers aren't friends; today I'm writing for
    the other people.)

  zh: 摘要
- en: When I introduce myself, I usually call myself a programmer, regardless of my
    current work on chip architecture and management and stuff. I got into programming
    for the money, so it's not like I'm overflowing with pride when uttering "programmer".
    I just think programming is a great career and the right thing to call myself
    for me.

  zh: 当我介绍自己时，我通常称自己为程序员，无论我当前从事芯片架构和管理等工作。我之所以从事编程是为了赚钱，所以当我说“程序员”时并不是因为我自豪得不得了。我只是觉得编程是一个很好的职业，对于我来说称自己为这个是正确的事情。
- en: There's an alternative approach where you program, but you don't call it that,
    and you use programming as a starting point from which you transition to some
    form of being involved in business as directly as possible.

- en: It sounds a bit roundabout to me – why not just get an MBA instead? – but maybe
    it's the right path for some (especially considering that some prestigious MBA

  zh: 这对我来说有点绕圈子 — 为什么不直接去读MBA呢？ — 但也许对一些人来说这是正确的路径（尤其考虑到一些知名MBA项目要求你在报名前拥有行业经验）。
- en: The important thing is to choose the path that suits your preferences, follow
    it consistently, and realize where your approach is most likely to succeed. Because
    where I work, someone applying for a programming position and not calling himself
    a programmer will not make a good impression.
