- en: Zig Software Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which I am proud
    to say makes **extremely efficient use of monetary resources**. Unlike many of
    our peers, our primary expense is direct payments to contributors for their enhancements
    to the Zig project.

    serving on the board of directors. The other two members of the ZSF board of directors

    $108,000/year (before taxes) and donating the rest to ZSF. In the past I have
    donated an even larger portion. In the future I think it would be nice to be fully
    compensated. |

    due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these

    while others are market-rate Hetzner bare metal machines that we run GitHub Actions

    that the previous year''s travel budget successfully helped grow Zig adoption,
    and raised the budget from $10,000 to $15,000\. In 2023, ZSF spent $10,847 of
    those allocated funds, increasing Zig''s presence in North America (e.g. Seattle,
    Vancouver) and Europe (e.g. Stockholm, Berlin, Amsterdam) as well as keeping up
    relationships with likeminded communities like [Handmade Seattle](https://handmade-seattle.com/).
