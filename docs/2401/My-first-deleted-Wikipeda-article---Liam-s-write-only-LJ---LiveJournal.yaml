    computing, it has been a given that all computers based on Intel x86 family CPUs
    were IBM PC Compatibles. This is not the case and never has been.

- en: From the earliest days of the PC market, there have been other MS-DOS systems
    which were not IBM PC-compatible, such as the Sirius Victor computers and some
    early models of Apricot Computers. These had 8088 or 8086 processors and ran their
    own versions of MS-DOS, but the memory layout, display controllers and other hardware
    were not identical to IBM's components and were located in different areas of
    memory. The companies had anticipated that by producing technically-superior designs
    which could run the popular MS-DOS operating system, they would be able to take
    advantage of the large library of MS-DOS applications software.

    flaw" of the IBM PC was the what is nowadays called Upper Memory Area - the location
    of the I/O area at the top of the memory map (from 640 KiB up to 1 MiB). Locating
    the I/O area at the bottom of the memory map instead made it possible and indeed
    simple to expand these machines' memories. More RAM just appeared at the top of
    the memory map, up to the 1 MiB addressable limit of the 8086 processor. Thus.
    machines such as the Victor could routinely take 800-900 KiB of RAM, considerably
    more than the PC's 640 KiB limit. Other improvements over the IBM PC design were
    high-density 1.2 MiB floppy drives as standard, integrated sound cards and monochrome
    graphics (comparable to the IBM PC's Hercules Graphics Card).

    that is not in reality a commercial success because in its early versions, MS-DOS
    was very basic and provided only meager functionality to applications developers.
    So rather than using DOS' APIs to control the hardware, most software authors
    "hit the metal" and controlled the PC hardware by writing directly to peripherals'
    control registers and so on. This meant that most PC applications could not run
    on other, non-PC-compatible x86 machines.

- en: This would have become irrelevant with the advent of Windows and especially
    Windows NT, as it provided extensive APIs to Windows applications and discouraged
    developers from accessing the hardware registers. However, the first version of
    Windows to be successful was Windows 3.0 in 1990, too late for the proprietary
    DOS machines, although some of the last non-PC-compatible Apricot systems did
    support their own special version of Windows 2.0 and therefore probably ran many
    of the Windows 2.0 applications.

    Concurrent CP/M machine which resembled a minicomputer, supporting only dumb terminals
    - it had no display controller or keyboard interface on the system unit. Another
    was the 3Com 3Server and later 3Server386, which were dedicated PC LAN servers,
    with support for neither displays and keyboards of their own nor even terminals
    - control, setup and administration was done remotely, over the network. These
    ran 3Com''s DOS-based NOS, 3+Share, which contained its own internal multitasking
    system. Although the 3Server achieved some commercial success, it had a less successful
    companion product, a diskless dedicated LAN workstation: the 3Station.'

    and thus be capable of running a full UNIX operating system. Sun Microsystems
    exploited this with the release of the Sun386i, a 386-based UNIX workstation.
    Though based on a processor mainly used in PCs and featuring ISA expansion slots,
    this was nonetheless a workstation, not a PC. Storage was on SCSI devices, it
    accepted a Sun Type 4 keyboard and optical mouse and booted via Sun firmware into
    SunOS 4\. The development codename of these machines was Roadrunner.

- en: Even though is was natively running UNIX, Sun developed this machine with the
    possibility to break into the PC market in mind. The Sun386i generally included
    a PC emulator (emulating an 8086) that could run MS-DOS and so normal DOS applications.
    As it was just a UNIX task more than one instance of the emulator could be used,
    essentially resulting in a multi-tasking DOS system. performance was pretty good,
    but the 386i didn't achieve a big market success. Old UNIX customers preferred
    the Sun-3 line, because most commercial UNIX applications were not available on
    the Sun386i. New customers mainly interested in MS-DOS had no really use for UNIX
    and preferred a real PC which ran MS-DOS natively faster and cheaper. Sun dropped
    the 386i line quickly when their SPARC systems reached the market. A successor
    workstation based on the 80486 processor (codename Apache) made it to prototype
    stage and would have been named the Sun486i; under 200 were made.

    offering and up to NT 4 it ran on systems powered by MIPS, DEC Alpha and later
    PowerPC processors from a variety of manufacturers. This was a spin-off of the
    unsuccessful Advanced Computing Environment initiative and its Advanced RISC Computing
    specification (ARCS).

    CPUs being dropped with the advent of Windows 2000, although for some time, Microsoft
    allegedly maintained the Alpha port internally to ensure that the code remained
    portable.

    in the form of the SGI Visual Workstations. Again, these run workstation firmware
    - in this case, ARCS - and have a totally un-PC-like arrangement of bus, display
    and so on, although it used an x86 processor. This is the first time the HAL in
    Windows NT helped to increase the success of the workstations, since most x86
    applications can run on it, thanks to the HAL.

    Macintosh systems will be generic PC compatibles, but this is not the case --
    final shipping products replaced the traditional BIOS with the newer EFI standard.
    Apple's new computers are merely the latest in a long line of Intel-based computers

    include, but are not restricted to, an IBM-PC-compatible BIOS, a compatible set
    of I/O ports, an Upper Memory Area containing video ROM and RAM and so on; in
    general terms, the detailed arrangement of the memory map of the system, including
    its firmware, its interrupts, its I/O ports and other factors, plus an x86 microprocessor.

    bus and some may have completely incompatible ones - such as the IBM Personal
    System/2 machines. On the other hand, the existence of PC standard slots does
    not mean that a machine is PC-compatible. Many non-PC architectures feature or
    have used ISA slots, including the Commodore Amiga, the Sinclair QL-compatible
    Q40 and Q60 machines and the Peters Plus Sprinter; PCI has been used in PowerPC
    Apple Macintosh machines and Sun workstations and AGP in more recent Macs.

    the presence of an x86 processor and a PC-like expansion bus, and even the ability
    to run Microsoft operating systems, does not mean that a computer is a PC.
