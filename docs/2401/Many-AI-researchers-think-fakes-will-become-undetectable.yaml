- en: Rishi Sunak is [Britain’s prime minister](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/11/23/what-kind-of-legacy-does-rishi-sunak-want-to-leave-behind).
    If some [advertisements on Facebook](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/22/facebook-sells-subscriptions-as-the-ad-business-stumbles)
    can be trusted (which they cannot) he also appears to be flogging get-rich-quick
    schemes. One such advert shows Mr Sunak endorsing an app supposedly developed
    by [Elon Musk](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/12/05/elon-musks-messiah-complex-may-bring-him-down),
    a businessman, into which viewers can make regular “savings”.

- en: The video is fake. Generated with the help of AI, it is just one of 143 such
    advertisements catalogued by Fenimore Harper Communications, a British firm, which
    ran in December and January. It is not just those in the public eye who can have
    their likenesses used for dubious ends. In June 2023 the Federal Bureau of Investigation
    in America warned the public of “malicious actors” using AI to create fake sexually
    themed videos and images of ordinary people, in order to extort money.
