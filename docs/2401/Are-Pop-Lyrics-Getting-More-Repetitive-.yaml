    [The Complexity of Songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complexity_of_Songs),
    which is basically one long joke about the repetitive lyrics of newfangled music
    (example quote: "the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less
    memory, and the ultimate improvement of Theorem 1 has consequently just been announced").'

    of a dataset of 15,000 songs that charted on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1958
    and 2017.

    a number isn''t easy. One thing we might try is looking at the number of unique
    words in a song, as a fraction of the total number of words. But this metric would
    call the following lyric excerpts equally repetitive:'

- en: You may not have heard of the [Lempel-Ziv algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78),
    but you probably use it every day. It's a lossless compression algorithm that
    powers gifs, pngs, and most archive formats (zip, gzip, rar...).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does this have to do with pop music? The Lempel-Ziv algorithm works by
    exploiting repeated sequences. How efficiently LZ can compress a text is directly
    related to the number and length of the repeated sections in that text.

    It turns out, for example, that the entire lyrics of *Cheap Thrills* reduce in
    size 76% when compressed.

- en: You may have noticed the percentages on the x-axis are not evenly spaced. I'm
    using a logarithmic scale with the property that, for any given song, a song that
    compresses half as small is a fixed distance away. For example, the distance between
    20% and 60% is the same as between 98% and 99%. I'll be using this kind of scale
    throughout.

    Several of the familiar entries on this list are essentially novelty songs (Macarena,
    Barbara Streisand, The Thong Song, Cotton Eye Joe...) famed for their silly refrains.
    This inspires some confidence in the metric I'm using.

    in the top 10 above, but it's also a bit overrepresented in my dataset (it's easier
    to find lyrics for recent songs). We'll need to look at a lot more data to be

- en: Genre does seem like a differentiating factor here. In the 00's, our artists
    actually separate pretty cleanly into two clusters, with country music and hip-hop
    (and whatever John Mayer does) on the left, and pop and rock on the right.

- en: The variation between artists is considerable. The Backstreet Boys have an average
    compression ratio of 60%, to Brad Paisley's 38%. In other words, if we asked the
    Backstreet Boys and Brad Paisley to each write a 400 word song, and compressed
    them both, we'd expect Brad's compressed song to be 50% bigger than BSB's.

    between the incessantly repetitive "Hollaback Girl", and the laid-back ballad
    "Cool", which is far less repetitive than the median song in the dataset.
