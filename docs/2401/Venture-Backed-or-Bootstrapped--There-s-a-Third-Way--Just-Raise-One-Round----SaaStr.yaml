- en: There’s so much debate on social media and elsewhere on bootstrapped vs VC.
     Bootstrapped you maintain control, and the unit economics.  But many see it as
    so much harder.  And it’s almost always longer.  VC can let you go faster, but
    it can become an addiction.  And the dilution all-in generally ends up being 60%-70%
    by the time you approach an IPO.

     Raising 2 small VC rounds < $10m or so together can also work.

- en: One round might dilute you from 100% ownership to 70%, but that’s it.  And if
    you raise say $3m, your investors may hope for a $3 Billion IPO.  But realistically,
    any “exit” will make them money,  No one (or at least, almost no one) is going
    to block an exit or create a lot of drama.

- en: Raise $3m, you can sell for $10m, $30m, $100m, whatever you want really.  Maintain
    control.  And still use that $3m to get off the ground and fund the initial core
    team.

    of my two startups and stopping there.  It has its cons.  You have to stay very
    efficient, and the competition can often outspend you.  It’s not always the right
    strategy.

    enough to start that people can eat.
