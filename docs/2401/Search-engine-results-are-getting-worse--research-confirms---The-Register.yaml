    after spending a year reviewing results for 7,392 product review queries on Google,
    Bing and DuckDuckGo, which they said is the first systematic review into the question
    of worsening search engine result quality.

    everyone complaining about Google's declining quality seems to be correct, and
    things are probably only going to get worse with the advent of generative AI -
    [just like we predicted](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/06/internet_ai_gpt_ios/).

    monetized with affiliate marketing, and they show signs of lower text quality,"
    the researchers wrote. They  also found that while a small portion of product
    reviews use affiliate marketing, the majority of search engine results do use
    the tactic, which is only adding to the problem of glum search engine results
    page (SERP) quality.'

    prone to being gamed by large-scale affiliate link spam campaigns, and their efforts
    to subvert such manipulation through algorithm updates have, at best, "a temporary
    positive effect." Google's targeting of SEO and affiliate spam appears to be the
    most effective, the team found.
