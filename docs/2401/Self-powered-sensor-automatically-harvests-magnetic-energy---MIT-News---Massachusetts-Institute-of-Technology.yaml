- en: MIT researchers have developed a battery-free, self-powered sensor that can
    harvest energy from its environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because it requires no battery that must be recharged or replaced, and because
    it requires no special wiring, such a sensor could be embedded in a hard-to-reach
    place, like inside the inner workings of a ship’s engine. There, it could automatically
    gather data on the machine’s power consumption and operations for long periods
    of time.

- en: The researchers built a temperature-sensing device that harvests energy from
    the magnetic field generated in the open air around a wire. One could simply clip
    the sensor around a wire that carries electricity — perhaps the wire that powers
    a motor — and it will automatically harvest and store energy which it uses to
    monitor the motor’s temperature.

    connection to get. And that makes this sensor very easy to install,” says Steve
    Leeb, the Emanuel E. Landsman Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer
    Science (EECS) and professor of mechanical engineering, a member of the Research
    Laboratory of Electronics, and senior author of a paper on the energy-harvesting
    sensor.

    as the featured article in the January issue of the *IEEE Sensors Journal*, the
    researchers offer a design guide for an energy-harvesting sensor that lets an
    engineer balance the available energy in the environment with their sensing needs.

    and control the flow of energy continually during operation.

- en: The versatile design framework is not limited to sensors that harvest magnetic
    field energy, and can be applied to those that use other power sources, like vibrations
    or sunlight. It could be used to build networks of sensors for factories, warehouses,
    and commercial spaces that cost less to install and maintain.

    and shown that it is a practically realizable solution. Now others will hopefully
    use our framework to get the ball rolling to design their own sensors,” says lead
    author Daniel Monagle, an EECS graduate student.

    U.S. Naval Academy who was not involved with this work, studies techniques to
    monitor ship systems. Getting access to power on a ship can be difficult, he says,
    since there are very few outlets and strict restrictions as to what equipment
    can be plugged in.

    crew real-time information on the health of the bearings and mounts, but powering
    a retrofit sensor often requires so much additional infrastructure that the investment
    is not worthwhile,” Donnal adds. “Energy-harvesting systems like this could make
    it possible to retrofit a wide variety of diagnostic sensors on ships and significantly
    reduce the overall cost of maintenance.”

- en: The researchers had to meet three key challenges to develop an effective, battery-free,
    energy-harvesting sensor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the system must be able to cold start, meaning it can fire up its electronics
    with no initial voltage. They accomplished this with a network of integrated circuits
    and transistors that allow the system to store energy until it reaches a certain
    threshold. The system will only turn on once it has stored enough power to fully
    operate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the system must store and convert the energy it harvests efficiently,
    and without a battery. While the researchers could have included a battery, that
    would add extra complexities to the system and could pose a fire risk.

- en: “You might not even have the luxury of sending out a technician to replace a
    battery. Instead, our system is maintenance-free. It harvests energy and operates
    itself,” Monagle adds.

- en: To avoid using a battery, they incorporate internal energy storage that can
    include a series of capacitors. Simpler than a battery, a capacitor stores energy
    in the electrical field between conductive plates. Capacitors can be made from
    a variety of materials, and their capabilities can be tuned to a range of operating
    conditions, safety requirements, and available space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The team carefully designed the capacitors so they are big enough to store the
    energy the device needs to turn on and start harvesting power, but small enough
    that the charge-up phase doesn’t take too long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, since a sensor might go weeks or even months before turning on
    to take a measurement, they ensured the capacitors can hold enough energy even
    if some leaks out over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, they developed a series of control algorithms that dynamically measure
    and budget the energy collected, stored, and used by the device. A microcontroller,
    the “brain” of the energy management interface, constantly checks how much energy
    is stored and infers whether to turn the sensor on or off, take a measurement,
    or kick the harvester into a higher gear so it can gather more energy for more
    complex sensing needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Just like when you change gears on a bike, the energy management interface
    looks at how the harvester is doing, essentially seeing whether it is pedaling
    too hard or too soft, and then it varies the electronic load so it can maximize
    the amount of power it is harvesting and match the harvest to the needs of the
    sensor,” Monagle explains.

- en: Using this design framework, they built an energy management circuit for an
    off-the-shelf temperature sensor. The device harvests magnetic field energy and
    uses it to continually sample temperature data, which it sends to a smartphone
    interface using Bluetooth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The researchers used super-low-power circuits to design the device, but quickly
    found that these circuits have tight restrictions on how much voltage they can
    withstand before breaking down. Harvesting too much power could cause the device
    to explode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid that, their energy harvester operating system in the microcontroller
    automatically adjusts or reduces the harvest if the amount of stored energy becomes
    excessive.

- en: They also found that communication — transmitting data gathered by the temperature
    sensor — was by far the most power-hungry operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Ensuring the sensor has enough stored energy to transmit data is a constant
    challenge that involves careful design,” Monagle says.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the future, the researchers plan to explore less energy-intensive means of
    transmitting data, such as using optics or acoustics. They also want to more rigorously
    model and predict how much energy might be coming into a system, or how much energy
    a sensor might need to take measurements, so a device could effectively gather
    even more data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “If you only make the measurements you think you need, you may miss something
    really valuable. With more information, you might be able to learn something you
    didn’t expect about a device’s operations. Our framework lets you balance those
    considerations,” Leeb says.

    node should internally entail for realistic scenarios. The overall design guidelines,
    particularly on the cold-start issue, are very helpful,” says Jinyeong Moon, an
    assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Florida A&M University-Florida
    State University College of Engineering who was not involved with this work. “Engineers
    planning to design a self-powering module for a wireless sensor node will greatly
    benefit from these guidelines, easily ticking off traditionally cumbersome cold-start-related
    checklists.”
