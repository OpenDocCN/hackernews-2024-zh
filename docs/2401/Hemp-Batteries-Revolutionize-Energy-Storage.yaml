- en: The versatility of hemp seems to know no bounds. Since its legalization for
    growth in the United States, hemp has been utilized in the production of more
    sustainable clothing, construction materials, and medicine. Now, it appears that
    hemp may also revolutionize the world of batteries. Researchers have discovered
    that hemp batteries can potentially last eight times longer than lithium-based
    batteries and outperform graphene at a fraction of the cost.

- en: Most of the batteries used in automobiles today are made from lithium-ion, a
    material known for being expensive and increasingly scarce. In response to these
    limitations, a team of American and Canadian researchers have developed a battery
    using hemp bast fiber - the inner bark of the plant that often ends up as waste
    in landfills.

    they used to build supercapacitors comparable or superior to graphene, the current
    industry gold standard. Graphene, a synthetic carbon material that is both lighter
    than foil and bulletproof, is unfortunately costly to produce.

    spoke to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28770876) about
    his team''s breakthrough: "People ask me: why hemp? I say, why not? We''re making
    graphene-like materials for a thousandth of the price – and we''re doing it with
    waste." Mitlin first published a description of the hemp battery in the [journal
    ACS Nano in 2014](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn400731g).'

    compared the performance of a hemp battery against a lithium-ion battery, and
    the results were astounding: the hemp battery was eight times more powerful. Tesla''s
    new million-mile battery, made from lithium-iron phosphate, is designed to last
    twice as long as conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, even this advanced
    battery cannot compete with the power and renewability of hemp-based batteries.'

- en: The development of hemp batteries offers a more sustainable and affordable alternative
    to lithium-ion and graphene-based batteries. By replacing lithium batteries with
    hemp, electric cars and other gadgets can become significantly more eco-friendly.
    The use of a renewable resource like hemp to create powerful and cost-effective
    batteries has the potential to revolutionize the battery industry, making our
    world more energy-efficient and sustainable.

- en: Hemp continues to prove its incredible versatility, and the development of hemp-based
    batteries is just another example of its potential to transform industries. As
    researchers continue to explore the full extent of hemp's capabilities, we can
    expect even more innovations that will make our world greener and more sustainable.
    With hemp batteries outperforming lithium and graphene at a fraction of the cost,
    the future of energy storage looks bright and environmentally friendly.
