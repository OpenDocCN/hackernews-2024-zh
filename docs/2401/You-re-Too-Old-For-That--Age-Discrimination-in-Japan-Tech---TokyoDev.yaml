  zh: 与招聘相关的诉讼之所以仍然不太突出部分原因是因为正如 Rathbone 所说，“无论如何，解雇都受到严格限制（即使不涉及年龄歧视），而在招聘方面没有明确的法律依据来主张年龄歧视。此外，日本没有发现制度，因此除非雇主明确提到年龄是拒绝雇佣的原因，否则证明招聘中的歧视是困难的。”

    damages awarded by the courts tends to be much lower than in the U.S. or other
    developed countries,” and “therefore, with the exception of lawsuits for invalidation
    of dismissal, there may indeed be fewer court cases based on age discrimination,”

    Chance的Nishi同样的问题。这是他的回答：
- en: The Japanese government has been studying the systems of other countries and
    has been debating for years whether to create a law that directly prohibits age
    discrimination, but no legislation has been enacted so far, and I think this is
    unlikely to change at least in the next several years. With an aging society as
    a backdrop, incorporating the elderly into the workforce is an important social
    issue, and discriminatory treatment on the basis of age without reasonable grounds
    is likely to be subject to more stringent scrutiny going forward.

    believed to be overly reserved in opinion, may be worth pondering… might there

    of cultural relativism (the “when in Rome” approach) is worth examining more closely.
    Could it be that cultural fit in Japan is a more powerful construct? Or, are companies—free
    from the legal constraints of their own nations—simply taking advantage of an
    opportunity to hire young because in Japan they can get away with it? As with

    alike, would agree that doing business in Japan would be virtually impossible
    without adopting the practice. Does gift giving violate a core human value? I

    over Google Meet (as well as via email) was beyond my expectations. Each helped
    shed light on what is, for most, a very hidden and confusing topic regarding the
    world of work here in Japan. To all, I thank you. —Doc*'
