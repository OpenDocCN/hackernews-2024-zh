    materials and waste streams are complex. Not all plastics are the same. And recycled
    plastics are not necessarily “better” – less harmful – than virgin plastics. If
    they contained harmful chemicals to begin with, recycling doesn’t make them less
    harmful. And sometimes they are contaminated by other substances.

    identifying and measuring the concentration of contaminants in recycled pellets
    from 28 small-scale recycling facilities in the global south. Plastic waste is
    often exported from high income countries to less developed countries, with few
    to no requirements for reporting their makeup.

    many others in the recycled plastic pellets. Many of these chemicals could be

    are currently used in the production of plastic materials and products. They can
    include thousands of plastics additives – but also substances that are added unintentionally.
    Some unwanted chemicals form during the production or life of plastics. Thousands
    of these chemicals have dangerous properties. The health risks of some others
    are unknown.

    can cause harm to humans or other organisms. They include pesticides, pharmaceuticals
    and fragrances. Others are chemicals that result from burning natural materials,
    man-made organic chemicals used for industrial applications like paint, and ultraviolet

    the allowable concentration of hazardous chemicals in specific plastic products.
    But only 1% of plastics chemicals are subject to international regulation in existing
    multilateral environmental agreements. Policies don’t adequately address the issue
    of transparent reporting of chemicals in plastics across their value chain. Also,
    there are no laws to govern monitoring of chemicals in recycled materials. This
    is a [serious gap](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk9846) in oversight.
    Stronger and more globally coordinated measures are necessary.

- en: Our findings emphasise the importance of regulating mechanical recycling, as
    many of the substances measured were contaminants and not plastic additives. Many
    of the chemicals we identified may have contaminated the materials during use.
    For example, a jug used for storing pesticides will absorb some of the pesticides
    and will contaminate the recycling waste stream. Plastics in the environment are
    also known to absorb [organic pollutants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005960).

    are present and in what concentrations. This information can guide regulations
    about how recycled plastics may be used. It will also be valuable for plastics
    producers, waste management workers (including recyclers), consumers, and the
    scientific community.
