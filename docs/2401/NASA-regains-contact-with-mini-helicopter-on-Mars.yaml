    aboard the rover Perseverance and became the first motorized craft to fly autonomously
    on another planet.

    communications were suddenly lost during a test flight on Thursday, Ingenuity's
    72nd lift-off on Mars.

    meters) on Flight 72, which was a "quick pop-up vertical flight to check out the
    helicopter's systems, following an unplanned early landing during its previous
    flight."

    early, prior to touchdown," the agency said.

    with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection."
