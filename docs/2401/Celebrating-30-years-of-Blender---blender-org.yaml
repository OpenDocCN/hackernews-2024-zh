- en: Today Blender turns 30 years old! To celebrate this milestone, Blender Foundation
    organized a donation drive during the month of December 2023\. The theme was “a
    gift for Blender”, inviting everyone to contribute with a gift, no matter big
    or small, to show support for the project and to ensure its independence as it
    keeps growing up.

    donations and Development Fund memberships, raising over 200k EUR in one month.
    Thank you to everyone who donated!

    on each step of the way. To express this feeling, the team has put together a
    little video.
