    quarter. It’s even more remarkable considering a year ago they were all but certain
    there’d be a recession by now and the economy would grow at a meager 0.2% rate.

    because [consumer spending](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/economy/retail-sales-december/index.html),
    which accounts for the biggest part of US GDP, has been relentless, even in the
    face of the highest interest rates in 23 years.

    a percentage of GDP on Covid stimulus than the US from 2020 to 2021, according

    when everything was basically closed during the pandemic, meant that people had
    a lot more cash in the bank. When the economy reopened people were spending like
    there was no tomorrow.

    all the stimulus money still flowing through the economy, Joseph Gagnon, a senior
    fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who previously worked
    at the Federal Reserve, told me.

    years, as evidenced by the nation’s declining tax revenue collections, Gagnon
    said. That’s caused the federal government to borrow a lot more money to pay its
    bills.

    the region, including the UK, is a net importer of energy, my colleagues Alicia
    Wallace and Hanna Ziady [previously reported](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/us-economy-china-europe/index.html#:~:text=Gross%20domestic%20product%20in%20the,for%20Oxford%20Economics%2C%20told%20CNN.).
    The UK and euro area economies were heavily exposed to the surge in natural gas
    prices that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
    driving energy bills for households and businesses to record highs.
