    Insurance Corporation surveys households about their connections to the banking
    system and asks people without bank accounts [why they don’t have one](https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021execsum.pdf).
    People can respond with multiple answers. In 2021, the top reason — with over
    40% of respondents choosing it — was that they didn’t have enough money to meet
    the minimum balance.

    to have bank accounts. About one-quarter of those earning less than $15,000 a
    year are unbanked, the FDIC found. Among those earning more than $75,000 a year,
    almost every person surveyed had some type of bank account.

    accounts, fees can be costly for those who can’t maintain a minimum balance. A
    recent Bankrate survey [shows basic monthly service fees](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/checking/checking-account-survey/)
    range between $5 and $15\. Beyond these steady fees, [banks earn $4 to $5](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/consumer-news/2021-12.html)

    checks](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/checking/what-is-a-cashiers-check/#fees-for-a-cashier-s-check).

    People with a bank account but who primarily rely on alternative services such

    U.S. households. Given that [2.5 people live in the average household](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/time-series/demo/families-and-households/hh-6.pdf),
    this means there are over 15 million people living in a home with no connection
    to banks, and 48 million more in homes with only a tenuous connection to banks.

    U.S. has little or no connection to banks or other financial institutions. That
    can leave them shut out from stores, restaurants, transportation and medical providers
    that don’t take cash.

    The questions on being banked or unbanked are supplemental questions [added to
    a survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html) given to people
    at their homes. This means it misses homeless people, transients without a permanent
    address and [undocumented immigrants](https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/population-estimates/unauthorized-resident).

    tax-identification number [to get a bank account](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/bsa/bsa_p5.pdf).
    Given roughly [2.5 million migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/22/1221006083/immigration-border-election-presidential)

    is different in other parts of the world. The [World Bank has created a database](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview)
    that shows the percentage of each country’s population that has access to financial
    services. The World Bank’s definition of being banked is broader than the FDIC’s,

    a bank account.

    For example, Walmart, one of the largest U.S. retailers, [offers a reloadable
    basic debit card](https://www.walmartmoneycard.com/). The card [costs $1 to buy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/6-ways-load-your-walmart-money-card.asp)
