    the docs/ folder. If you encounter problems with the build system please let us
    know, but please note the expectation is that you are able to dig into basic issues
    by yourself. If you have no programming experience, please use the packaged version
    instead.

    you can reproduce them in the packaged version, as the Qt version or other libraries
    on your system can be the cause of some problems.
