    provides insight into the rationale behind the British policy of appeasement in
    the period leading up to World War II. It also serves as a cautionary tale of
    the appeasement strategy’s failure. A policy premised on acquiescing to a tyrant’s
    demands in the hopes of avoiding war accomplished the opposite. Instead, appeasement
    served to increase Hitler’s appetite for conquest and contributed to the eruption
    of the most destructive conflict in human history.

    However, the parallels between Benito Mussolini’s invasion of Abyssinia (modern-day
    Ethiopia) and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are striking. Historical comparisons
    are inherently imperfect. We cannot replicate the political, economic, social,
    and technological conditions that existed in the past. However, we can extract
    and examine themes and notable decisions in history to provide the foundation
    for important lessons for today’s leaders. A reexamination of the Italian conquest
    provides such lessons that underscore mistakes to avoid and the possible consequences
    the West faces if support for Ukraine falters.

    to reclaim dominion over Taiwan. By understanding the dynamics in play in 1935,
    it becomes clear that if the United States and other members of the international
    community want to deter aggression against the island, then it is in their collective
    security interest to continue to support Ukraine. But the China-Taiwan scenario
    is far from the only risk. Other potential aggressors, such as Iran and North
