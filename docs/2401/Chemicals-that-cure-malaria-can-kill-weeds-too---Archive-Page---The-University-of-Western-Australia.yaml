- en: Plant biologists at The University of Western Australia have revealed the relationship
    between plants and the parasite that causes malaria is close enough to mean many
    antimalarial drugs are effective herbicides.

- en: The work offers a new take on an evolutionary connection made in the 1990s when
    herbicides were shown to interfere with processes in the malarial parasite.

    , shows that the extensive knowledge of antimalarial drugs could be applied to
    creating much-needed new herbicides.

    enlisted in the Army Reserve and was assigned to the Australian Army Malaria Institute
    in Brisbane.

- en: Dr Mylne said almost 20 years ago, researchers used herbicides to prove that
    the malarial parasite *Plasmodium* contained an organelle that was essential and
    did many of the same things plant chloroplasts did.

    drugs, but thinking seems not to have extended in the opposite direction,” Dr
    Mylne said.

    differently or have different targets; a feature called the mode of action.”

- en: Dr Mylne, now a principal investigator with UWA’s School of Molecular Sciences,
    affiliated with the national ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology,
    said herbicides were integral for modern day agriculture, but the success of glyphosate
    and spiralling costs to develop new herbicides had stymied progress.

    during a time that over 500 new cases of herbicide resistance have appeared,”
    he said.

    drugs were ideal as starting points because they were non-toxic to humans and
    often had the right chemical properties to also affect plants.

    to use knowledge about antimalarial drugs and even the drugs themselves to develop
    new herbicides against weeds.

    thousands of compounds at the same time,” he said.

    herbicides, it also means you can think about what antimalarial modes of action
    are not being exploited by herbicides and whether they could be.”
