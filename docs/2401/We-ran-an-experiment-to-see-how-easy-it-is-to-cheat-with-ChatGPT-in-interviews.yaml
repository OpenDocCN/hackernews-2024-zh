    is to start a shared doc with your team where every time someone solves a problem
    they think is interesting, no matter how small, they jot down a quick note. These
    notes don’t have to be fleshed out at all, but they can be the seeds for unique
    interview questions that give candidates insight into the day-to-day at your company.
    Turning these disjointed seeds into interview questions takes thought and effort
    — you have to prune a lot of the details and distill the essence of the problem
    into something that doesn’t take the candidate a lot of work/setup to grok. You’ll
    also likely have to iterate on these home-grown questions a few times before you
    get them right — but the payoff can be huge.

  zh: 我们发现非常有用的一件事是提出好的、原创的问题，方法是与你的团队开始一个共享文档，每当有人解决一个他们认为有趣的问题，无论多么小，他们就会写下一个简短的笔记。这些笔记不必完全详细，但它们可以是独特面试问题的种子，可以让候选人了解你公司的日常工作。将这些不连贯的种子转化为面试问题需要思考和努力——你必须剪裁掉很多细节，并将问题的本质提炼成候选人不需要大量工作/设置就能理解的东西。你还可能需要对这些自制问题进行几次迭代，直到你做对为止——但回报是巨大的。
- en: To be clear, we’re not advocating the removal of data structures and algorithms
    from technical interviews. DS&A questions have gotten a bad reputation because
    of bad, unengaged interviewers and because of companies lazily rehashing LeetCode
    problems, many of them bad, which have nothing to do with their work. In the hands
    of good interviewers, those questions are powerful and useful. If you use the
    approach above, you’ll be able to come up with new data structure & algorithmic
    questions that have a practical foundation and component that will engage candidates
    and get them excited about the work you’re doing.
