    in the France and Benelux regions, [took to X](https://twitter.com/ant1monin/status/1737406219361370233)
    this week to decry [a new tax](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/france-proposed-tax-music-streaming-115743209.html)
    that will impose a levy of what is expected to be between 1.5 and 1.75% on all
    music-streaming services, with the proceeds going toward the Centre National de
    la Musique (CNM), [which was established in 2020](https://cnm.fr/en/about-us/)
    to support the French music sector.'

- en: While all the major music-streaming platforms have come together in opposition
    to the new law, including Apple, Google’s YouTube and local player Deezer, Spotify
    has been the most vocal. In the wake of the announcement last week, Spotify [said
    that the move](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/internet/streaming/spotify/taxe-sur-les-plateformes-d-ecoute-de-musique-en-ligne-la-france-ne-sera-plus-une-priorite-pour-spotify-avertit-son-dg_6242370.html)
    was a “real blow to innovation,” and that it was evaluating its next moves.

    Monin noting that it will pull support for [Francofolies de la Rochelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Francofolies_de_La_Rochelle)
    and the [Printemps de Bourges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printemps_de_Bourges)
    festivals starting from 2024, which it has been supporting financially and via
    other on-the-ground resources. Monin added that “other announcements will follow
    in 2024,” though he didn’t elaborate on what those actions might be.

- en: It’s worth noting that Spotify was recently embroiled in a *tête-à-tête* with
    the Uruguayan government over a new law that promises “fair and equitable” remuneration
    for all artists involved in a recording. Spotify argued the law would mean it
    would have to pay rightsholders twice for the same tracks, and it would [thus
    cease operating in the country](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-12-01/spotify-is-being-pushed-out-of-uruguay/).
    The company later [pulled a 180-degree turn](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/spotify-u-turns-on-uruguay-exit-after-government-gives-assurances-on-artist-payments/)
    when the government gave assurances that music-streaming platforms wouldn’t be
    expected to cover any extra costs resulting from the law.

- en: France is different, insofar as it’s likely a much bigger market for Spotify
    and pulling out is not a viable course of action. And as Monin hinted at last
    week, its plan of action is likely to center more around reallocating resources
    to other markets.

  zh: 法国与众不同，因为对于Spotify而言，法国可能是一个更大的市场，退出并不是一个可行的选择。正如Monin上周暗示的那样，其行动计划可能更多地集中于将资源重新分配到其他市场。
- en: “Spotify will have the means to absorb this tax, but Spotify will disinvest
    in France and will invest in other markets,” Monin said [in an interview](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/internet/streaming/spotify/taxe-sur-les-plateformes-d-ecoute-de-musique-en-ligne-la-france-ne-sera-plus-une-priorite-pour-spotify-avertit-son-dg_6242370.html)
