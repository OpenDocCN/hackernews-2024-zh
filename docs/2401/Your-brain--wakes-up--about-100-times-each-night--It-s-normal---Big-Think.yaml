    completely uninterrupted, but a new study conducted on mice — which [share basic
    sleep mechanisms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867320300225)
    with us — suggests that brief, repeated “wake-ups” during sleep are completely
    normal, and may actually augur well for one’s memory. The [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01102-9)
    was recently published in *Nature Neuroscience*.

    characterized by shifting brain patterns, fluids flushing in and out of the skull,
    and a drop in body temperature, all with the apparent aim of restoring the brain
    as its waking functions are disabled.

    appears to play a significant role, even though it’s released at lower levels
    during sleep compared to when we’re awake. Observing the [brains](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/memory-consolidation-sleep/)
    of mice as the critters slept, scientists from the University of Copenhagen watched
    norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline) levels rise and fall in a steady, oscillatory
    pattern, and noticed that this rhythm coincided with frequent, fleeting spurts
    of arousal in the brain.

    a night,” co-first author Celia Kjærby, an assistant professor from the Center

    brief moments is the same as when you are awake. But the moment is so brief that
    the sleeper will not notice,” PhD student Mie Andersen, the other co-first author
    of the study, [added](https://healthsciences.ku.dk/newsfaculty-news/2022/07/stress-transmitter-wakes-you-up-more-than-100-times-a-night--and-it-is-perfectly-normal/).

    had a greater amplitude — meaning a larger disparity between peak levels of the
    hormone and the lowest levels — it led to more complete awakenings but also increased
    the frequency of [sleep spindles](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-spindles),
    [brain wave](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/antidepressants-sleep/) patterns
    experienced during sleep associated with learning and memory processing.

    to store memory when you dive back into sleep,” Maiken Nedergaard, a Professor

    oscillation in mice’s sleeping brains, either through genetic engineering or pharmaceuticals,
    they found that the mice performed worse on memory tests compared to unaltered
    controls.

    that theirs should as similar biological sleep mechanisms are observed among mammals.
    Creating a technique in humans to fine-tune norepinephrine oscillations as we
    sleep “might provide a powerful therapeutic tool in promoting the memory-enhancing
    segments of sleep,” the researchers write.

    seamless. Brief wake-ups, whether noticed or unnoticed, seem to be quite normal
    and are generally not a cause for concern unless triggered by a disorder such
    as [sleep apnea](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-apnea).

    suggests that short-term awakenings are a natural part of sleep phases related
    to memory. It may even mean that you have slept really well,” first author Kjærby
    stated.
