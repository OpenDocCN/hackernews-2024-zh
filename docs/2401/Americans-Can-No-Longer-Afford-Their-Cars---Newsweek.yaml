    vehicles becoming symbols of freedom, independence and even rebellion, as well
    as a necessity. But in 2024, the country's legendary love story with the automobile
    appears to have reached a crucial point of potential no return, as cars have become
    unaffordable to millions.

    Reserve decided to stop hiking rates—new car prices rose by 1 percent to an average
    of $50,364, while used car prices fell by only 2 percent to an average of $31,030.

    10 percent of new car listings are currently priced below $30,000, according to
    CoPilot. Things are not much better in the used car market, where only 28 percent
    of listings are currently priced below $20,000.

    of at least $100,000 to afford a car, at least if they're following standard budgeting
    advice, which says you shouldn't spend more than 10 percent of your monthly income
    on car-related expenses.

    afford to buy a new car, based on Census data. For individuals, the numbers are
    even worse, with 82 percent of people below the $100,000 line.

    at the upper end of the market, and they never fully recovered. Across most brands

    analyst at car consumer guide Edmunds—an online resource for cars inventory and
    information—told *Newsweek*. "In November 2019, the average transaction price
    for a new vehicle was $38,500\. In November of 2023, that figure jumped to $47,939."'

    consumer demand in 2021, really put a strain on vehicle inventory and drove prices

    more profitable, higher-trim vehicles in their lineups, which meant the inventory

    seem to be no more affordable cars in the U.S.—including that automakers are increasingly
