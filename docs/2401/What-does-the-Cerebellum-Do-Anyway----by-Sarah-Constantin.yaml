    working memory, fear extinction learning, mental preparation of imminent actions,
    and procedural learning.

    but these have less well understood functions.

    — you can’t have long chains of interconnected neurons messing around if you want
    to give near-real-time model responses to control immediate action.

    the frontal lobes. The “hindbrain” is for boring, animal stuff, like controlling
    heart rate and hormones. Real thinking happens behind your noble brow.

    imagined or inner speech — passes through both the cerebrum *and* cerebellum.
    (Speech, after all, is motion, and imagined speech is simulated motion. I can
    literally feel subtle movements and tension in my tongue and jaw when I think.)

- en: Most things we do have a cerebellar component, what some neuroscientists call
    a cerebellar *transform*, smoothing and tuning and relating and fluently switching
    between the basic building-block abilities (sensory perception, motion, comprehension)
    that reside in the cerebrum.

- en: The cerebellum regulates rate, rhythm, speed, contextual appropriateness; damage
    it, and the same building block actions are still possible, but all out of whack,
    clumsy and disproportionate.

- en: This is consistent with the “embodied cognition” worldview where sensorimotor
    functions are *on a continuum with* or *of the same kind as* cognitive functions;
    thought is just “inner” motion and/or “inner” sensation. (And even abstract thought
    is built up of motions and sensations, via analogy or metaphor.)

- en: The cerebellum may also inspire artificial-intelligence approaches somewhat,
    especially approaches to robotics or other control, in that it may be be beneficial
    to include a fast feedforward-only predictive modeling step to control real-time
    actions, alongside a slower training/updating pathway for model retraining. (I
    may formalize this more in a later post).
