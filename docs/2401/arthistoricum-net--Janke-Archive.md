Karl Hans Janke grew up as an only child in a lower middle-class family. After graduating from high school (Abitur) in 1941, he entered military service, which he was forced to end in 1943, due to his poor health.
In 1949, he was committed for the first time to a psychiatric clinic in Arnsdorf (Saxony) and was moved a year later to the Hubertusburg State Psychiatric Institution in Wermsdorf (Saxony).

The diagnosis of "chronic paranoid schizophrenia," to which his symptoms of "delusional inventing" and drawing were attributed, meant that he would remain in clinical care for the rest of his life – a time period of nearly 40 years, which resulted in the production of more than 4,000 drawings and models of Janke’s visionary flying objects, as well as other inventions of his.

After the rediscovery of this extraordinary body of graphic work in 2000 by Dr. Peter Grampp, the non-profit organisation [Rosengarten e.V.](http://www.rosengarten-ev.de/ "Zur Homepage des Vereins") was entrusted with the management of Janke’s estate.
