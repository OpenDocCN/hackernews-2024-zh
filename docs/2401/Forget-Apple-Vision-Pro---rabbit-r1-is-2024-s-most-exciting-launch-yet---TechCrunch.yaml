- en: The year is off to a quick start in terms of new product launches and availability,
    even leaving aside the usual mid-tier smorgasbord that is CES. Apple just started
    pre-sales of its [Vision Pro mixed reality headset](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/17/i-spent-the-morning-with-the-apple-vision-pro/),
    with shipments beginning in early February; meanwhile, Samsung debuted the next
    generation of the only viable iPhone competitor out there, the Galaxy S-series.
    Despite these heavyweights trying to front-run the year, however, a startup’s
    oddball take on what the future of personal tech might look like is the most exciting
    thing to happen in gadgets in a long, long while.

- en: I’m talking about the [rabbit r1, the AI-powered hardware](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/can-a-striking-design-set-rabbits-r1-pocket-ai-apart-from-a-gaggle-of-virtual-assistants/)
    unveiled with a fairly impressive, if low-budget impression of an old-school Apple
    keynote in a small conference room deep within the rabbit’s warren of a Las Vegas
    casino during CES. The r1 deserves praise just for its physical design, which
    is a tidy bit of kit created in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the gadget
    “it” brand of young millennials and Gen Z everywhere.

- en: Unlike the Apple Vision Pro, which looks like the lavish, over-slick encumbered
    bit of technology’s past masquerading as technology’s future that it is, the rabbit
    r1 has a pared down, satisfying economy that I think comes much closer to what
    future generations want from their tech. On the functionality side, Vision Pro
    is an exercise in UI over saturation; the r1 aims to be as close as you can currently
    get to having no UI at all.

- en: The premise of the rabbit r1, in case you missed it, is that it does most, if
    not all, of what your smartphone can do, but it uses AI to accomplish all the
    tasks in response to natural language queries. So that could be playing music,
    booking airfare, providing directions, hailing a ride, ordering food, translating
    in real time and much more.

- en: There are tons of questions remaining regarding how the rabbit r1 will work
    in real-world situations, and how rabbit’s business model (which so far seems
    to only involve selling individual units at a flat price of $199, without any
    recurring subscription fees) will work. But the rabbit r1 already has the kind
    of organic hype that would-be competitors like the Humane AI pin wished they’d
    been able to drum up with their carefully tuned, but massively overblown protracted
    promo campaign.

- en: On the other hand, we know quite a lot about how Apple Vision Pro works and
    performs, thanks to a recently expanded hands-on preview program that engaged
    the media and influencers to come and try out the headset in demos occurring in
    the run-up to today’s pre-order day, and everyone seems more than impressed with
    the device’s performance and visual prowess. Reactions are more mixed on everything
    from the complexity of setup, to user interface elements like the visual keyboard,
    to long-term wearability and comfort.

- en: 'The rabbit r1, like the Humane AI pin and other AI-first devices starting to
    come to market doubtless have a ton of kinks to work out before they get to a
    place where they’re overall useful, but generative AI already shares something
    in common with the last major computing paradigm Apple revolutionized — the mobile
    phone. Specifically, it’s being used and appreciated everywhere by average consumers.
    I’ve lost count of how many people tell me they just use ChatGPT daily for their
    actual work, who have nothing to do with the technology industry. The reverse
    is also true: No one I know who isn’t someone professionally connected to tech
    owns or regularly uses a VR headset of any kind.'

    were beginning to fall in love with smartphones. Rabbit is introducing the r1
    when people are already in love with AI, as the term applies to large language
    models like ChatGPT. Apple, meanwhile, is introducing the Vision Pro to a world
    where a decade or so of trying has utterly failed to create any kind of mass uptake
    of virtual, mixed or augmented reality headset use.

- en: If Apple is right and “spatial computing” becomes the next big platform shift,
    I suspect I’ll be too old to care that I was wrong by the time it does. But increasingly,
    I think companies like rabbit are working with a more realistic and viable version
    of computing’s future than some of the legacy players out there who are trying,
    and failing, to shot-call the next big thing.
