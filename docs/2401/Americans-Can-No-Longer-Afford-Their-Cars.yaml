    vehicles becoming symbols of freedom, independence and even rebellion, as well
    as a necessity. But in 2024, the country's legendary love story with the automobile
    appears to have reached a crucial point of potential no return, as cars have become
    unaffordable to millions.

    he told *Newsweek*. "Supply chain disruptions also forced manufacturers to prioritize
    more profitable, higher-trim vehicles in their lineups, which meant the inventory
    available to purchase also carried a higher sticker price."'
