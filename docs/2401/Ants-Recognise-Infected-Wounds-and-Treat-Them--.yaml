    recognise when the wounds become infected and initiate antibiotic treatment.

- en: 'The Matabele ants (*Megaponera analis*), which are widespread south of the
    Sahara, have a narrow diet: They only eat termites. Their hunting expeditions
    are dangerous because termite soldiers defend their conspecifics – and use their
    powerful mandibles to do so. It is therefore common for the ants to be injured
    while hunting.'

    Matabele ants have developed a sophisticated healthcare system: they can distinguish
    between non-infected and infected wounds and treat the latter efficiently with
    antibiotics they produce themselves. This is reported by a team led by Dr Erik
    Frank from Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) Würzburg and Professor Laurent
    Keller from the University of Lausanne in the journal *Nature Communications*.'

    that the hydrocarbon profile of the ant cuticle changes as a result of a wound
    infection," says Erik Frank. It is precisely this change that the ants are able
    to recognise and thus diagnose the infection status of injured nestmates.'

    infected wounds. They take these antibiotics from the metapleural gland, which
    is located on the side of their thorax. Its secretion contains 112 components,
    half of which have an antimicrobial or wound-healing effect. And the therapy is
    highly effective: the mortality rate of infected individuals is reduced by 90
    per cent, as the research group discovered.'

    carry out such sophisticated medical wound treatments," says Erik Frank. Laurent
    Keller also adds that these findings “have medical implications because the primary
    pathogen in ant’s wounds, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, is also a leading cause of
    infection in humans, with several strains being resistant to antibiotics”.'

    wants to explore wound care behaviours in other ant species and other social animals.
    He also wants to identify and analyse the antibiotics used by Matabele ants in
    cooperation with chemistry research groups. This may lead to the discovery of
    new antibiotics that could also be used in humans.

    a Matabele ant can be seen treating a wounded conspecific marked with a white
    dot. It grabs its metapleural gland with a front leg, collects antibiotic substances
    from there and transfers them to the wound.

- en: A few years ago, Erik Frank's research into the African ants that care for their
    injured nestmates sparked the interest of a film production company. The company
    was commissioned by Netflix to find exciting stories for the eight-part nature
    documentary "Life on Our Planet", which focuses on the evolution of life over
    the past 500 million years.

    by Steven Spielberg and the English version is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman.
    The series has been translated into German and numerous other languages. The Matabele
    ants appear in the fifth episode, which is called "In the Shadow of Giants" and
    lasts 51 minutes.

    station of the University of Würzburg in Côte d'Ivoire. "It took three weeks,
    the effort was enormous," says the JMU researcher. The film was shot in the ants'
    natural habitat, but also in artificial nests in the research station's laboratory.
    And Erik Frank's expertise was in constant demand during this time.

    Ants), previously only available in French, has been on the market since October
    2023\. In this autobiographical story, the author describes his research, his
    experiences at the Comoé research station and his time as a doctoral student at
    the University of Würzburg. In France, the book was one of the six works nominated
    as the best books for science communication in 2022\. [Website of the publisher](https://www.cnrseditions.fr/catalogue/societe/une-histoire-de-fourmis/).
