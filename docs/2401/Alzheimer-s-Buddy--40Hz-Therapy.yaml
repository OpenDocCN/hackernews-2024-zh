- en: Come on, this must be a joke, right? No, really. Think about it— your eyes take
    in light which stimulates your retina, which sends pulses through your optical
    nerve, which is connected to... your brain! Your eyes are like a direct port to
    your brain, and can be electrically stimulated through optical stimulation. And
    if you think about it, your ears are quite similar— sound waves come into your
    ear and vibrate bones and hairs that cause neurons to fire electrical signals
    directly into your brain. So, it stands to reason that you could induce electrical
    behavior in your brain by stimulating both sensory modalities at the same time,
    using pulses at the same frequency. Why 40 times a second? That just seems to
    work the best in experiments with animals, but probably doesn't need to be exactly
    at that rate.
  id: totrans-23

- en: But then why should stimulating your brain with induced electrical activity
    help with anything, let alone Alzheimer's? Well, there's an old saying in neuroscience
    that "Neurons that fire together, wire together." By stimulating various parts
    of your brain to fire periodically 40 times a second in a synchronized way, that
    could cause areas of the brain to become better synchronized and connected. Does
    this explain exactly how or why this treatment might work? Of course not, it's
    just a "hand-waving" argument to show intuitively how it might help. But what
    do you have to lose? Unless you have epilepsy, using this should be harmless.
    And Alzheimer's is a horrible disease.
