- en: The post-Cold War era began, in the early 1990s, with soaring visions of global
    peace. It is ending, three decades later, with surging risks of global war. Today,
    Europe is experiencing its most devastating military conflict in generations.
    A brutal fight between Israel and Hamas is sowing violence and instability across
    the Middle East. East Asia, fortunately, is not at war. But it isn’t exactly peaceful,
    either, as China coerces its neighbors and amasses military power at a historic
    rate. If many Americans don’t realize how close the world is to being ravaged
    by fierce, interlocking conflicts, perhaps that’s because they’ve forgotten how
    the last global war came about.

    the part of the war that began with Japan’s strike on Pearl Harbor in December
    1941\. After that attack, and Adolf Hitler’s subsequent declaration of war against
    the United States, the conflict was a single, all-encompassing struggle between
    rival alliances on a global battlefield. But World War II began as a trio of loosely
    connected contests for primacy in key regions stretching from Europe to the Asia-Pacific—contests
    that eventually climaxed and coalesced in globally consuming ways. The history
    of this period reveals the darker aspects of strategic interdependence in a war-torn

    years after Japan initiated the Pacific War by invading China. Second, the United

    globalized from the moment the United States entered it; from December 1941 onward,
    the conflict featured one multicontinent coalition, the Grand Alliance, fighting
    another multicontinent coalition, the Axis, on multiple fronts. (The exception
    was that the Soviet Union remained at peace with Japan from 1941 until 1945.)

    Germany then paid it forward in 1940 by crushing France, putting the United Kingdom

    Asia. Particular tactics also migrated from theater to theater; the use of terror

  zh: 这种情况可能不会发生有很多原因。东亚可能保持和平，因为美国和中国有巨大的激励避免可怕的战争。 乌克兰和[中东](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/middle-east)的战斗可能会减弱。但是思考噩梦般的情景仍然是值得的，因为世界可能只差一次处理不当的危机就会陷入广泛的欧亚冲突，并且美国对此毫无准备。
- en: 'Right now, the United States is straining to support Israel and Ukraine simultaneously.
    The demands of these two wars—fights in which Washington is not yet a principal
    combatant—are stretching U.S. capabilities in areas such as artillery and missile
    defense. Deployments to the waters around the Middle East, meant to deter Iran
    and keep critical sea-lanes open, are taxing the resources of the U.S. Navy. Strikes
    against Houthi targets in Yemen are consuming assets, such as Tomahawk missiles,
    that would be at a premium in a U.S.-Chinese conflict. These are all symptoms
    of a bigger problem: the shrinking ability and capacities of the U.S. military
    relative to its numerous, interrelated challenges.'

  zh: 目前，美国正在竭力支持以色列和乌克兰。这两场战争的要求——华盛顿还不是主要参与者的战斗——正在拉伸美国在炮兵和导弹防御等领域的能力。部署到中东周围的水域，旨在震慑伊朗并保持重要海上通道的畅通，正在消耗美国海军的资源。针对也门胡塞武装目标的打击正在消耗一些在美中对峙情况下将会变得极为宝贵的资产，比如战斧导弹。这些都是一个更大问题的症状：相对于其众多、相互关联的挑战，美国军队的能力和能力正在萎缩。
- en: During the 2010s, the Pentagon gradually shifted away from a military strategy
    meant to defeat two rogue-state adversaries at the same time, opting instead for
    a one-war strategy aimed at defeating a single great-power rival, China, in a
    high-intensity fight. In one sense, this was a sensible response to the extreme
    demands such a conflict would entail. But it has also left the Pentagon ill equipped
    for a world in which a combination of hostile great powers and serious regional
    threats are menacing multiple theaters at once. It has also, perhaps, emboldened
    more aggressive U.S. adversaries, such as Russia and Iran, which surely realize
    that an overstretched superpower—with a military desperate to focus on China—has
    limited ability to respond to other probes.

  zh: 在2010年代，五角大楼逐渐转变了军事战略，不再是同时击败两个流氓国家的策略，而是选择了一个针对单一大国竞争对手——中国的一战战略，旨在进行高强度战斗。在某种意义上，这是对这种冲突所带来的极端要求的一个合理回应。但这也使五角大楼在一个同时威胁多个战区的世界里，缺乏必要的装备。也许更重要的是，这可能激励了更为侵略性的美国对手，如俄罗斯和伊朗，他们肯定意识到，一个军事上渴望专注于中国的超级大国，有限的能力回应其他挑衅。
- en: Of course, the United States wasn’t ready for global war in 1941, but it eventually
    prevailed through a world-beating mobilization of military and industrial might.
    President Joe Biden evoked that achievement late last year, saying the United
    States must again be the “arsenal of democracy.” His administration has invested
    in expanding the production of artillery ammunition, long-range missiles, and
    other important weapons. But the harsh reality is that the defense industrial
    base that won World War II and then the Cold War no longer exists, thanks to persistent
    underinvestment and the broader decline of U.S. manufacturing. Shortages and bottlenecks
    are pervasive; the Pentagon recently [acknowledged](https://www.businessdefense.gov/indpol/docs/ndis/2023-NDIS.pdf)
    “material gaps” in its ability to “rapidly scale production” in a crisis. Many
    allies have even weaker defense industrial bases.

  zh: 当然，美国在1941年并没有为全球战争做好准备，但最终通过对军事和工业力量的卓越动员而取得了胜利。乔·拜登总统在去年年底提到了这一成就，他说美国必须再次成为“民主的军火库”。他的政府已投资于扩大火炮弹药、远程导弹和其他重要武器的生产。但残酷的现实是，赢得第二次世界大战和冷战的国防工业基地已经不复存在，这归因于持续的投资不足和美国制造业的更广泛衰落。短缺和瓶颈普遍存在；五角大楼最近承认其在“迅速扩大生产”能力方面存在“物资缺口”。许多盟友的国防工业基地甚至更为薄弱。

- en: Thus, the United States would have great difficulty mobilizing for a multitheater
    war, or even mobilizing for protracted conflict in a single region while keeping
    allies supplied in others. It might struggle to generate the vast magazines of
    munitions needed for great-power conflict or to replace ships, planes, and submarines
    lost in the fighting. It would surely be hard-pressed to keep pace with its most
    potent rival in a potential war in the western Pacific; as a Pentagon [report](https://www.businessdefense.gov/indpol/docs/ndis/2023-NDIS.pdf)
    puts it, China is now “the global industrial powerhouse in many areas—from shipbuilding
    to critical minerals to microelectronics,” which could give it a crucial mobilization
    advantage in a contest with the United States. If war does engulf multiple theaters
    of Eurasia, Washington and its allies might not win.

  zh: 因此，美国将很难为多战区战争动员，甚至很难在单一地区持续冲突的情况下，同时保持对其他地区盟友的支援。它可能会在为大国冲突提供所需的大量弹药或替换在战斗中损失的舰艇、飞机和潜艇方面遇到困难。在西太平洋潜在战争中，它肯定会难以跟上其最强大的竞争对手；正如五角大楼的一份[报告](https://www.businessdefense.gov/indpol/docs/ndis/2023-NDIS.pdf)所说，中国现在在许多领域已经成为“全球工业强国——从造船到关键矿产到微电子”，这可能使它在与美国的比赛中拥有关键的动员优势。如果战争席卷了欧亚大陆的多个战区，华盛顿及其盟友可能无法取得胜利。
- en: It isn’t helpful to pretend that there is an obvious, near-term solution to
    these problems. Focusing U.S. military power and strategic attention overwhelmingly
    on Asia, as some analysts advocate, would take a toll on American global leadership
    in any circumstances. At a time when the Middle East and Europe are already in
    such profound turmoil, it could be tantamount to superpower suicide. But although
    dramatically ramping up military spending to drive down global risk is strategically
    essential, it seems politically inexpedient, at least until the United States
    suffers a more jarring geopolitical shock. In any case, it would take time—time
    Washington and its friends might not have—for even sizable increases in defense
    outlays to have a tangible military effect. The Biden administration’s approach
    seems to involve muddling through in Ukraine and the Middle East, making only
    marginal, selective increases in military spending, and betting the house that
    China doesn’t become more bellicose—a policy that could work well enough but could
    also fail disastrously.

  zh: 假装这些问题有一个明显的、近期的解决方案是没有帮助的。 把美国军事力量和战略关注重点放在亚洲，正如一些分析人士所主张的那样，在任何情况下都会对美国的全球领导地位造成伤害。
    在中东和欧洲已经处于如此深刻的动荡时期，这可能等于超级大国的自杀。 但是，尽管戏剧性地增加军费以降低全球风险在战略上是必不可少的，但至少在美国遭受更大的地缘政治冲击之前，似乎在政治上是不明智的。
    无论如何，这需要时间——华盛顿及其朋友可能没有的时间——即使国防开支有相当大的增加，也需要时间才能产生切实的军事效果。 拜登政府的方法似乎是在乌克兰和中东靠浑浑噩噩度过，只在军事开支上进行边际的、选择性的增加，赌上一切的是中国不会变得更好战——这种政策可能运行得很好，但也可能灾难性地失败。
- en: The international scene has darkened dramatically in recent years. In 2021,
    the Biden administration could envision a “stable and predictable” relationship
    with Russia—until that country invaded Ukraine in 2022\. In 2023, U.S. officials
    deemed the Middle East quieter than at any time this century—just before a devastating,
    regionally destabilizing conflict broke out. U.S.-Chinese tensions aren’t particularly
    febrile at the moment, but sharpening rivalry and a shifting military balance
    make for a dangerous mix. Great catastrophes often seem unthinkable until they
    happen. As the strategic environment deteriorates, it’s time to recognize how
    eminently thinkable global conflict has become.

  zh: 近年来，国际形势急剧恶化。 在2021年，拜登政府可能设想与俄罗斯有一个“稳定而可预测的”关系，直到那个国家在2022年入侵乌克兰。 在2023年，美国官员认为中东比本世纪的任何时候都要安静，就在一个破坏性的、在地区上造成不稳定的冲突爆发之前。
    美中的紧张局势目前并不特别火热，但是日益加剧的对抗和军事平衡的转变造成了一种危险的混合。 伟大的灾难常常在发生之前看起来是不可想象的。 随着战略环境的恶化，是时候认识到全球冲突变得非常可想象了。
