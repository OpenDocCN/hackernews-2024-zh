- en: Non-lubricated keyholes could be wasting you seconds every day. Now, you might
    argue that the number of seconds required to research, acquire, and implement
    keyhole lubricant would easily outweigh the amount saved through optimal key insertion
    — and you'd probably be right.

    at all.

- en: The seconds you choose to use now, to lubricate your keyholes, will allow you
    to save seconds when you choose to do something more important than lubricating
    your keyholes — and that's to say nothing of the seconds you use just sitting
    around not lubricating anything at all.

    five times — and then again after applying dry keyhole lubricant.

- en: I was surprised by the effectiveness of this intervention. An average of `2.442
    seconds` saved per entry. If I enter that door every day for a year, that amounts
    to around `15 minutes`. The keyhole is one of three, two of which are particularly
    sticky — so more time to save still.

- en: Lubricating your keyholes is easy, but it requires dry graphite powder lubricant.
    Wet lubricant like WD40 will gather dust and could make your keyholes worse, it
    will also give you oily fingers.
