Are you looking to learn a new language, explore musical genres, or improve your poker game in 2024? We’ve compiled 13 free online courses from MIT OpenCourseWare to kick start the new year on a positive note — from Italian, The Beatles, and heavy metal to poker theory, the history of Samurai, and different ways to understand climate change.

# Learn (or create) a new language

Create your own language while considering the basic linguistic characteristics of various languages of the world. This course material explores languages that have been deliberately constructed, including Esperanto, Klingon, and Tolkien’s Elvish.

Learn basic conversational Italian, and discover Italian culture and the Mediterranean diet. Each topic in this course is based on bite-sized acquisition of Italian language and culture, as well as the preparation of a delicious dish.

# Get creative with a music course

Learn everything you ever wanted to know about heavy metal music, including musicology, songwriting tropes, and how the genre tackles some of today’s biggest socio-political challenges — among other topics.

Delve into the music of The Beatles, from the band’s early years to their break-up. Learn how The Beatles’ musical style changed from skiffle and rock to studio-based experimentation. This course explores the cultural influences that helped to shape The Beatles and the band’s influence worldwide.

Watch a recording of a concert of Beethoven violin sonatas on period instruments. This course also includes a discussion about Susanna Ogata and Ian Watson’s performance.

# Take a playful management course

Improve your poker game by exploring theory and the applications of poker analytics to investment management and trading.

Become a seasoned player at Texas Hold’em, one of the most popular variants of poker. This course covers general concepts, as well as the poker and math concepts needed to play the card game on a professional level.

# Travel to the past with a history course

Discover the historical origins of the Japanese warrior class and its reinvention. This course covers the rise of the imperial court, interactions with the broader world, and the establishment of a warrior-dominated state.

# Expand your mind with a science course

Explore cutting-edge tools and techniques designed to revitalize and enhance scientific practices in the cognitive and neuro sciences. This course illustrates how to identify obstacles to conducting robust scientific research, as well as tools to overcome these obstacles.

Learn the three laws of thermodynamics through their connection with climate change. Explore concepts such as entropy and enthalpy, applications like energy conversion and energy storage, and investigate the causes and effects of global warming from a thermodynamics perspective.

This course focuses on how chemistry is connected to important innovations — and sometimes unexpected consequences — in science and in life. You might start with the “Why This Matters” series of short excerpts from the course’s lecture videos to learn about real-world applications and creative directions for research.

# Educational resources beyond the virtual classroom

These resources are made especially for educators who want to integrate climate justice content into courses across many disciplines, and they’re great for anyone exploring the many facets of climate justice.

This one-day, hands-on workshop for high school girls provides an introduction to camera physics and technology. Learn how to tear down old dSLR cameras, build a Raspberry Pi camera, design Instagram filters and Photoshop tools, and run your own version of this workshop.
