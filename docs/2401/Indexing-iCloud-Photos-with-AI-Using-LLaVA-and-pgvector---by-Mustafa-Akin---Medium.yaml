- en: 'I’ve been fascinated about the rise of AI. However, for the most of the part,
    it feels like magic. I like to get to the bottom fo the things as much as possible.
    My favorite courses at CS Undergrad were Digital Design, Computer Architecture,
    Operating Systems and Networking, and I was in the 1% in them (except networking,
    damn Electronics students). I liked them very much. Though my father taught me
    Visual Basic and databases when I was around 10, taking these courses was finally
    when it clicked me. It felt like when Neo finally saw the Matrix being just green
    code in a vertical `<marquee>`, but mine was in a much less cool version of enlightenment:
    “that’s you mean by 64-bit CPU” and “oh okay hyper-threading does mean 2x CPU
    all the time”, and “I know for loop order is important for optimal cache performance
    in some architectures”, “oh internet is 1500 bytes of messages exchanged. it’s
    a miracle it works at this scale” etc.'

- en: But, the AI changed everything for me. To be frank, I have almost no idea what’s
    going on with the latest developments. And this is coming from a CS PhD drop-out
    (*partly due to military obligation postponement and partly due to self-discovery
    process*) that had no choice but to take several classical (in other words, boring)
    AI and Machine Learning courses due to hype and almost no serious professor wanted
    to work on operating systems, distributing systems and networking (which were
    my favorite), but only shiny things like Bioinformatics with 50 people in one
    paper and old machine learning.

    in a single file and operate in less than 8GB RAM in a M1 machine is fucking amazing.
    But, as most of us does not need to deal with CPU architectures all the day, we
    don’t have to really understand how matrix multiplication ends up the sand having
    some sort of artificial intelligence.

    but I did not have strong use cases. Let me put out this for once. Adding an AI/LLM
    powered chatbot to your website for customer support, summarizing documentation
    or converting natural language to SQL is only slightly useful; but yeah it probably
    enables you to say you have “AI” in your product.

    a multi-modal LLM that can understand images, and improve the semantic search
    on my photo archive in iCloud. Apple Photos can already recognize the things on
    the image and provide a full text search on images. However, it can only detect
    objects and colors. I found the Google Photos search much better.

    better that there are state of the art labeling and segmentation algorithms for
    images that perform very well and work much more efficiently than an LLM. But
    I want to try this idea.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How about we ask an LLM and what it sees in an image, and embed the response
    as a vector using a popular algorithm and let the users search on that? Nothing
    state of the art, but it’s an interesting case. Obviously the performance will
    be dependent upon the recognition of the LLM, but can an open-source model be
    good enough to search my photos? If it’s good enough, can it evolve into something
    else? Let’s dive in.
  prefs: []

- en: For starters, if you are using iCloud Photos, all of your Photos thumbnails
    are searchable in a local directory, even if all the Photos are not in your Mac
    due to storage concerns. There is also an SQLite database of your Photos and I
    had a [descriptive blog on it in 2019](/@mustafaakin/how-to-organize-your-messy-albums-on-photos-app-on-macos-with-some-sql-and-image-processing-9e6a2566f6f0),
    however the schemas seem to have changed and you have better luck on the [Simon
    Willison’s blog](https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/).

- en: To keep things simple, I made a code to recursively list the JPEG files in the
    thumbnails folder of iCloud which can be found in **`~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/derivatives**/.
    They are smaller versions of the original photos, but they are more than enough
    for our use case. As an LLM model, I’ve chosen LLaVA with Q4 and used the just
    executable [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) which makes
    deployment extremely easy. This has a REST API that I can call and all I need
    to do is to encode the images.

    I did not have much choice. Since I’m not a PhD student anymore, I will not be
    releasing anything against benchmarks, but I’ll be sharing a few examples on what
    LLaVA generates with different prompts using different temperatures and compare

    around blogs and YouTube **defaults with OpenAI,** and it makes me **sad**. Don’t
    get me wrong, I’m grateful that they exist, but the ability to run a LLM with
    vision on your computer is amazing, and we should not be dependent on a single
    company no matter what they do. I’m an old Linux user and that could not afford
    a Macbook, and without access to Linux, a free operating system and a package
    manager, my programming skills would not progress as much as they did (I felt
    Windows hold back many details). So don’t be a simp for a company with a $100
    billion valuation and go ahead and support open source LLMs, don’t default to
    proprietary. I’m grateful for the work OpenAI does to advance the area, but there
    are even special LLMs that can even work on edge. I also don’t want to upload
    my whole album to a firm with questionable privacy practices.

    more specific things I assume it’d work better, as you can see the extensive descriptions
    with minimal hallucination. If there are lots of objects, LLaVA can generate nice

    other people or give an idea. If I see an actual product being built upon any
    of the ideas here, I would be more than happy. This is my goal. I have no time
    or relevant experience to pursue further on this idea. Otherwise, instead of this
    blog, it’d be on a pitch deck.

    this product will likely search for very specific things, like “blue t-shirt baby
    on Christmas”, not paragraphs of data. However, the LLM outputs are much longer
    than typical user query. I’m not really sure if it is a good idea to run very
    different string lengths using vector embeddings.
