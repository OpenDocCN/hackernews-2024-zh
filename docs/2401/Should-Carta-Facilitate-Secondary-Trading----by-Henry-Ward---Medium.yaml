- en: We started eShares 10 years ago as the “Nasdaq for Private Markets” (we were
    not “the captable company”) because I wanted to solve the liquidity problem for
    founders, employees, and angel investors. The percentage of startups that get
    to IPO is so small that 99% of founders never receive liquidity and spend a decade
    or more paper rich but cash poor. That seemed a problem worth solving.

    business is about $250M/year, fund administration is about $100M, private equity
    is about $20M, and the secondary trading business is about $3M. We have done a
    decent job at building the captable business, an ok job at fund admin (but feeling
    the growing pains), and an abysmal job at the secondary business.'

    — like captables, 409As, fund administration, private equity. But ALL of my ideas
    around liquidity — auctions, investor matching, secondary trading, open tender
    offers, have not worked. I might not be the entrepreneur that can solve this problem.

- en: But I am learning something else — Carta might not be *the company* that can
    solve this problem. Many people think we are best poised to solve liquidity because
    we have captable data. But that same argument is used for data products. People
    say “You have all the data so you should put Pitchbook out of business!” But it
    is precisely *because* we have the data, that we can’t use it. It is our customers’
    data, not ours. That’s why in ten years Carta has never released a data product.
    I use Pitchbook and Techcrunch when I research a company before I meet the CEO.

    disadvantage if people think we use it. For example, if we send emails to prospects
    through publicly available information, how do customers know if we sourced it
    publicly or internally? Will they believe us if we tell them? And does it matter?
    Just the appearance of impropriety is damning.

- en: From the beginning, we have always built for founders. Even in our liquidity
    business, the northstar has been to create systematic founder liquidity, that
    they control, which they can extend to everyone else on the captable. Historically,
    liquidity has not been founder friendly and our goal was to change that. But we
    have not succeeded.

- en: We won’t do anything that threatens the trust of our founders. And so we will
    exit the secondary trading business to eliminate any concern that we are not acting
    in our founders’ best interests. We will focus on what we do best, which is cap
    table and fund administration software. There are many many talented people working
    on the private market liquidity problem. We will enthusiastically cheer for them
    from the sidelines. It is an important problem. I hope someone solves it.
