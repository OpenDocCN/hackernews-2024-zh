- en: On Thursday, [Mashable reported](https://mashable.com/article/youtube-demontizes-public-domain-steamboat-willie-disney-copyright-claim)
    that YouTuber and voice actor Brock Baker had uploaded a video to his channel
    with over 1 million subscribers which was almost immediately hit with a copyright
    claim from Disney.

- en: Baker's video featured the entirety of the 1928 Disney animated short *Steamboat
    Willie*. He had remixed the film, which stars Mickey Mouse, with his own comedic
    audio track playing over the nearly 8-minute cartoon, and released it under the
    title "Steamboat Willie (Brock's Dub)."

- en: After being hit with the claim, Baker's upload became demonetized, meaning the
    YouTuber could not make any money off of it. The claim also blocked the ability
    to embed the video on third-party websites. In addition, the YouTube video was
    given limited visibility, including being blocked from view entirely in certain
    countries.

- en: Baker disputed the copyright claim shortly after receiving it. His case appeared
    strong, as *Steamboat Willie* entered the public domain on January 1, 2024, allowing
    a broad range of creative usage of the film and its contents without Disney's
    permission — including for profit.

- en: There has been lots of speculation online about what exactly can be done with
    *Steamboat Willie* that won't draw the ire of or potential lawsuit from Disney,
    which still holds the trademark (which is different from a copyright) for uses
    of the iconic Mickey Mouse character in certain contexts. According to [TechDirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/youtube-still-blocking-access-to-steamboat-willie-on-behalf-of-disney-in-some-countries/
    "(opens in a new window)"), other *Steamboat Willie* videos have also reportedly
    received copyright claims over the past few days.

  zh: 网上已经有很多关于如何才能在不惹恼迪士尼或潜在诉讼的情况下使用*Steamboat Willie*的猜测，迪士尼仍然在某些情况下持有标志性米奇老鼠角色的商标（这与版权不同）。根据[TechDirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/youtube-still-blocking-access-to-steamboat-willie-on-behalf-of-disney-in-some-countries/
    "(在新窗口中打开)")，据报道，过去几天里，其他*Steamboat Willie*视频也收到了版权索赔。
- en: YouTube, for its part, historically asserts that it does not mediate copyright
    claims. It's up to the copyright holder to make claims via its Content ID tool,
    and it's up to uploaders to dispute those claims when they believe they were incorrectly
    made. According to YouTube, the responsibility to release claims on content that
    has fallen into the public domain is with the Content ID user, who in this case
    is Disney.

  zh: YouTube，从历史上看，坚称不介入版权索赔。由版权持有者通过其内容识别工具提出索赔，并由上传者在认为索赔错误时提出异议。据YouTube称，释放已进入公共领域的内容的责任在于Content
    ID用户，而在这种情况下是迪士尼。
- en: Based on how quickly Baker's video was flagged, Disney's copyright claim on
    his upload was likely automated, drawing from YouTube's Content ID database. Mashable
    has reached out to Disney for more information and will update this piece if we
    hear back.

  zh: 根据贝克的视频被标记的速度，迪士尼对他的上传作出的版权索赔很可能是自动化的，来源于YouTube的Content ID数据库。 Mashable已经联系迪士尼以获取更多信息，如果我们收到回复，我们将更新这篇文章。
- en: But, the way this has played out will likely be genuinely helpful to those looking
    to create new creative works based on the newly public domain title *Steamboat
    Willie*. By releasing the YouTube copyright claim on Baker's video, Disney has
    made what could be its first official public action recognizing that *Steamboat
    Willie* along with this version of Mickey Mouse is indeed public domain.

  zh: 但是，这种发展方式很可能对那些希望基于新公共领域标题*Steamboat Willie*创建新创作的人真正有帮助。通过释放贝克视频上的YouTube版权声明，迪士尼已经做出了可能是其第一个官方公开行动，承认*Steamboat
    Willie*以及这个版本的米奇老鼠确实属于公共领域。
- en: In other words, content like Baker's is allowed, with or without Disney's input.
