- en: On Thursday, [Mashable reported](https://mashable.com/article/youtube-demontizes-public-domain-steamboat-willie-disney-copyright-claim)
    that YouTuber and voice actor Brock Baker had uploaded a video to his channel
    with over 1 million subscribers which was almost immediately hit with a copyright
    claim from Disney.

- en: Baker's video featured the entirety of the 1928 Disney animated short *Steamboat
    Willie*. He had remixed the film, which stars Mickey Mouse, with his own comedic
    audio track playing over the nearly 8-minute cartoon, and released it under the
    title "Steamboat Willie (Brock's Dub)."

- en: After being hit with the claim, Baker's upload became demonetized, meaning the
    YouTuber could not make any money off of it. The claim also blocked the ability
    to embed the video on third-party websites. In addition, the YouTube video was
    given limited visibility, including being blocked from view entirely in certain
    countries.

- en: Baker disputed the copyright claim shortly after receiving it. His case appeared
    strong, as *Steamboat Willie* entered the public domain on January 1, 2024, allowing
    a broad range of creative usage of the film and its contents without Disney's
    permission — including for profit.

    Baker told us, referencing YouTube''s policies which gave Disney an entire month

    behind the scenes."'

- en: There has been lots of speculation online about what exactly can be done with
    *Steamboat Willie* that won't draw the ire of or potential lawsuit from Disney,
    which still holds the trademark (which is different from a copyright) for uses
    of the iconic Mickey Mouse character in certain contexts. According to [TechDirt](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/03/youtube-still-blocking-access-to-steamboat-willie-on-behalf-of-disney-in-some-countries/
    "(opens in a new window)"), other *Steamboat Willie* videos have also reportedly
    received copyright claims over the past few days.

    claims. It's up to the copyright holder to make claims via its Content ID tool,
    and it's up to uploaders to dispute those claims when they believe they were incorrectly
    made. According to YouTube, the responsibility to release claims on content that
    has fallen into the public domain is with the Content ID user, who in this case
    is Disney.

- en: Based on how quickly Baker's video was flagged, Disney's copyright claim on
    his upload was likely automated, drawing from YouTube's Content ID database. Mashable
    has reached out to Disney for more information and will update this piece if we
    hear back.

    to create new creative works based on the newly public domain title *Steamboat
    Willie*. By releasing the YouTube copyright claim on Baker's video, Disney has
    made what could be its first official public action recognizing that *Steamboat
    Willie* along with this version of Mickey Mouse is indeed public domain.
