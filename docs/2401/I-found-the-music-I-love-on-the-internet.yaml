- en: I was born in the late 80s and grew up in the 90s. My musical journey started
    with tapes. First it was *The Traveling Wilbury's Vol. 1*, my parents playing
    that until the tape snapped. That tape lived in an old brown van we had, the interior
    covered in shag carpet, a bench seat in back. Next up was Nirvana's *Unplugged
    in New York* that made it from my dad's old Chevy Nova to the Honda Civic that
    replaced it.

- en: Eventually we graduated to CDs, my first MP3 player being a near-indestructible
    [Dell Digital Jukebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Digital_Jukebox). That
    was the first time I ripped a CD and realized I should tag the MP3s — a two disc
    compilation of Led Zeppelin's greatest hits. When I was old enough to drive those
    MP3s were burned to CD-Rs, kept in clumsy cases on the sun visors and yellowed
    with age. I traded mixed CDs with friends at school. I didn't understand the quality
    implications of re-ripping CDs for my clumsily assembled collection until l got
    a bit older.

    I called and bugged their staff to special order CDs for me. I checked the local
    Borders and Barnes and Noble when it made sense (which was rare). I ripped the
    CDs, I bought a shelf to store them in, I loaded them on my Juke Box.

- en: I found forums frequented by kids my age. I hung out in the music sections.
    I slowly gravitated towards the metal sections. I found European power metal bands.
    I loved [Blind Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Guardian). I never
    quite got Iron Maiden, I still don't and I don't know why, but music is subjective.
    I branched out to metal-focused forums — some bands hosted their own and I saw
    a few posters older than myself getting logos and art tattooed.

- en: I went back to Borders, I picked up *[Deliverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverance_%28Opeth_album%29)*
    by [Opeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opeth) expecting it to sound like *[Damnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnation_%28album%29)*.
    I joined [Last.fm](http://Last.fm), cycled through accounts and began tracing
    similar artists to find new bands. I found [Encyclopaedia Metallum](https://www.metal-archives.com/)
    and, if there was a band I liked, I'd click over to the members tab and listen
    to the other projects the musicians in the band participated in. I'd go back to
    [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) and sift through the similar artists for those projects.
    I bought those CDs, I swapped my Digital Jukebox for an iPod and swapped [Musicmatch
    Jukebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicmatch_Jukebox) and WinAmp for iTunes.

- en: I found more forums, this time geared towards more extreme metal as my taste
    edged in that direction — I set aside the power metal and started picking up music
    like Cynic's *[Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_%28Cynic_album%29)*,
    challenging myself to pick it apart with repeat listens until it sunk in. I found
    online CD distributors and music shops like The End records. I fell in love with
    [Agalloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agalloch)'s music and bought everything
    they released until they broke up.

- en: I found [Augury](https://augurymetal.com/) as a recommendation for fans of [Cynic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynic_%28band%29)
    and I helped them set up their Facebook fan page when pages launched. I helped
    them with their website, I helped Cynic with their site and their pages. I found
    [Gorguts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorguts) and [Atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_%28band%29)
    and briefly did the same. I interned for Augury's record label — I flew to Montreal
    for the release of their second LP. I crashed with the band and I got to see them
    rehearse, meet their fans, buy an unreasonable amount of merch and hang out at
    the local record shop.

    trolling, posted [their marquee LP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_%28album%29)
    on a forum asking if it was the best punk album ever or **the** best album ever.

    switch to Rdio and then moved to Spotify. I sold my CDs and I kept my MP3s. I
    stopped collecting audio files (like most folks have). I stopped using [Last.fm](http://Last.fm)
    and I stopped visiting the local record stores.

- en: I tried Apple Music when it launched — it performed horribly, duplicated tracks
    and even overheated a phone to the point the battery had to be swapped. I went
    back to Spotify. I met my wife and we bonded over a mutual love of [The National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_%28band%29).
    We met [Matt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Berninger) backstage at a show
    once and we mentioned this to him — he remarked that he wished he could blame
    [Michael Stipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe) whenever anything
    went wrong in his marriage. He was gracious and kind. My wife tolerates all of
    the death and black metal. We drove 500+ miles to see [Tom Waits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits)
    play live. He hasn't played another show since.

    internet keeps churning, often feeling like it's inexorably getting worse but,
    at least, there's always more music.
