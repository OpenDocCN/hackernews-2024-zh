- en: Mozilla has decided to be more vocal about the ways in which Apple, Google,
    and Microsoft set technical requirements that have hindered development of its
    Firefox web browser, and therefore harmed competition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the competitive barriers have been discussed for years – in technical
    circles, and behind closed doors with regulators. During those years, Firefox's
    30 percent of the global browser market share slipped steadily. Today, [just over
    three percent](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202306)
    of browser users favor Firefox – the impact of platform rules and of relentless
    marketing.

    for [Europe's Digital Markets Act](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/26/apple_ios_browser/)

    to address these issues," the development group [declared](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/01/19/platform-tilt/).
    "With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we think
    it''s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent process and tools

    and GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/mozilla/platform-tilt/issues) that
    enumerate and explain the technical barriers imposed by rival browser makers that
    put Firefox at a competitive disadvantage.

    by actual importance – is [Rule 2.5.6](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements)
    of the Apple App Store Review Guidelines, which requires that all browsers on
    iOS use Apple's WebKit rendering engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The consequence of that requirement is that all browsers for iOS are essentially
    Apple's WebKit under the hood – making it hard for developers to differentiate
    their products.

- en: Lack of browser competition and differentiation on Apple's iOS has been a sore
    point for Mozilla – and for Google, which drives development of the Chromium browser
    engine that powers both its own Chrome browser and Microsoft's Edge. Or at least
    it does on every platform bar Apple’s.

- en: For example, iOS [disallows](https://github.com/mozilla/platform-tilt/issues/2)
    third-party apps from using Safari's multi-process architecture unless they do
    so through WebKit. Also, iOS [doesn't allow](https://github.com/mozilla/platform-tilt/issues/3)
    the creation of memory regions that are both writable and executable – yet it
    makes an exception for WebKit and other Apple applications.
