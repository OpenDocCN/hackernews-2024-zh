    the ways of automated exploit discovery & analysis at A.R.P. Syndicate.

    more precisely & stealthily you hit, the better you get & the faster you achieve
    multiple hits, the best you get to be. That‚Äôs the kind of intelligent offensive
    fuzzing automation I wanted to build since I was 16.

    on who is navigating it. As a lazy navigator in the mysterious realms of offensive
    cybersecurity, the exploit discovery aspect used to disappoint me the most. I
    felt like it just needed to be easier & quicker. So, I decided to work on evolving
    it.

    & popular cutting-edge platforms like [Vulners](https://vulners.com) but none
    of them were either capable or just interested in being what I needed them to
    be. That‚Äôs why [Exploit Observer](https://exploit.observer) came into existence.

    uses Exploit Observer to not only to keep track of public exploits but also curate

    very great on its own right now but it‚Äôs definitely a real time saver.'
