    riddle submissions. For this commemorative occasion, each participant was given
    a theme related to the meaning of one of the *kanji* characters in Kasetsu’s name
    (“wave”, “moon”, “flower”, or “snow”), which was then combined with one of the
    five elements (“wood”, “fire”, “earth”, “metal”, or “water”). It is not easy to
    interpret the images, but Satoyuki’s theme was “flower and metal” and Doryū’s
    “moon and wave [water]”. Others are even more cryptic: a woman soaking pieces
    of paper with writings on them in a washbasin is “wave and water”, a man nodding
    to sleep is “flower and metal”, as is a woman brandishing a sword with her foot
    raised.'
