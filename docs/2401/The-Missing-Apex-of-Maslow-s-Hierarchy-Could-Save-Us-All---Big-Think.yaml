    died, he wasn’t quite finished with his famous hierarchy of human needs.

    published in *Psychological Review*. Here’s the hierarchy as it seemed to him
    when it was published in 1943.

    final thoughts on the matter. In his later years, he added a [new apex to the
    pyramid](http://the-mouse-trap.com/2007/12/14/maslows-eight-basic-needs-and-the-eight-stage-devlopmental-model/):
    *self-transcendence*.'

    of Willow Group, recently spent a summer at [Singularity University](https://su.org),
    whose mission is to be “a global community using exponential technologies to tackle
    the world’s biggest challenges.” While there, she had the opportunity to hear
    talks by a stream of experts and forward-thinkers. At the end, she came away convinced
    that the most serious problems facing humanity aren’t technical: Although engineering
    our way out of trouble *is* possible, it can’t happen until we transcend ourselves,
    seeing beyond our own individual well-being to the needs of us all.'

    needs at the bottom of the pyramid, having worked on our emotional needs in its
    middle and worked at achieving our potential, Maslow felt we needed to transcend
    thoughts of ourselves as islands. We had to see ourselves as part of the broader
    universe to develop the common priorities that can allow humankind to survive
    as a species.'

- en: Maslow saw techniques many of us are familiar with today — mindfulness, flow
    — as the means by which individuals can achieve the broader perspective that comes
    with self-transcendence. Given the importance of coming together as a global community,
    his work suggests that these methods and others like them aren’t just tweaks available
    for optimizing our minds, but vitally important tools if we hope to continue as
    a living species.
