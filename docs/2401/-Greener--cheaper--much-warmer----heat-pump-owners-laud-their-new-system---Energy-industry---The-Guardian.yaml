- en: Gillian Woodward, 50, says her house has been “completely transformed for the
    better” by installing an air source heat pump. Woodward, a community nurse in
    north Wales, was “astounded” to discover that she was eligible for a government-backed
    means-tested grant that covered the whole cost of insulating and installing a
    heat pump in her home.

    “But the technology has improved a lot and satisfaction levels, even in old homes,
    are high. I thought it was worth the risk.”

    were 83%, challenging the idea that the heating technology is only suited to those

    EPC F rating, previously relied on a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) combination
    boiler. During the winter, Woodward used to get through a £75 gas bottle every
    10 days, on top of monthly electricity costs of about £100 this time last year.
    “The costs of heating were astronomical even for the most minimal amount,” she
    says.

    pump in his 1962 three-bed dormer bungalow in Staffordshire, after installing
    it in August 2022\. “We knew we would need a new boiler in the next year or two
    and went for a heat pump instead because of the CO[2] savings. Overall we’re very
    happy with the system and it has kept us warm even in cold weather,” says the
    32-year-old, adding that he has replaced a few of the property’s radiators and
    his home already had cavity wall insulation and some loft insulation.

    that works differently from the previous gas boiler. “It’s a different sort of
    heat and more comfortable overall. The key thing is to keep it on as long as possible
    in cold weather, including overnight. If you’re away it needs to either be left
    on at low level or started several days before returning. The lower flow temperatures
    mean it would take several days to warm the house from stone cold.”

    with running costs, according to Nesta, and Corkley says he has not seen a noticeable
    change in his overall energy costs after accounting for price rises. But he does
    not know if he will recoup the costs of installation – he spent £7,000 on top
    of his £5,000 government grant **–** “unless the price of electricity falls relative
    to gas”. Since Corkley installed the system, the government has [increased heat

    research shows they have been largely popular with owners. “Heat pumps are a hit
    with people who have them installed. Three in four people are as, or more, happy
    with their heat pump compared with their previous heating system. Our research
    also found that high satisfaction with heat pumps was the same whether the house
    was a new-build or an older property.

    “they would benefit from more information on how to best use their heat pump”.

    since taking the plunge and investing in a heat pump in late 2014 in an early
    18th-century cottage in Herefordshire that she renovated with her partner. “We
    wanted to future-proof the cottage, having rescued it from complete dereliction
    in 2012,” Black, 67, says. “We have no access to mains gas and wanted to reduce
    our impact on the environment.”

    source heat pump’s running costs have been high, and as the cottage is Grade II-listed,
    they are not allowed to have standard double glazing. After a thermal imaging
    survey, they retrofitted the home with further insulation after the heat pump
    was installed, which has helped cut energy usage, but they now rely on a wood
    burning stove for heating, the pump for hot water, and solar panels for some of
    their electricity.

    – we found unless we had it cranked up to an enormously high level, it doesn’t

    lasted three days. That’s another factor in us not wanting to completely rely
    on a heat pump.
