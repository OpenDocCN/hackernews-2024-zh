    to some of our colleagues. This is a difficult process, but it is one that will
    best enable Blizzard and Xbox to deliver ambitious games for our players on more
    platforms and in more places than ever before. We are moving forward with a more
    focused strategy across Microsoft Gaming that sets us up for sustainable growth
    and aligns our talent and resources to our top priorities.

    future and some of his personal passions for some time. As many of you know, Mike
    previously spent more than 20 years at Microsoft. Now that he has seen the acquisition
    through as Blizzard’s president, he has decided to leave the company. As we move
    forward, we will continue to build on the positive momentum that Mike created
    and strive to continue exceeding the expectations of Blizzard’s players. I want
    to thank Mike for his leadership and for his partnership and counsel since the
    deal closed. I know he plans to travel and spend more time with his family. We
    wish him the very best.

    As one of Blizzard’s cofounders, Allen has had a broad impact on all of Blizzard’s
    games. His influence will be felt for years to come, both directly and indirectly
    as Allen plans to continue mentoring young designers across the industry.

    the challenging day ahead, anyone who is set up to work from home and would prefer
    to, can work remotely today. Due to time zones and local holidays, some impacted
    employees in APAC and EMEA will be informed later this evening and into early
    next week. After the notifications are complete, leaders will bring their teams
    together. Please be mindful of this process in your conversations and outreach
    during these next few days.

- en: The changes announced today reflect a focus on products and strategies that
    hold the most promise for Blizzard’s future growth, as well as identified areas
    of overlap across Blizzard and Microsoft Gaming. Today’s actions affect multiple
    teams within Blizzard, including development teams, shared service organizations
    and corporate functions. As part of this focus, Blizzard is ending development
    on its survival game project and will be shifting some of the people working on
    it to one of several promising new projects Blizzard has in the early stages of
    development.

    like these affect the lives of colleagues and friends, and we are all grateful
    for their meaningful contributions to Blizzard and its world class lineup of games.
    As Phil stated, we will provide our full support to those who are impacted during
    the transition, including severance benefits informed by local employment laws.

    I haven’t met many of you yet, and hearing about these decisions from me may be
    difficult. Today, I am here on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, and I am personally committed
    to supporting you as teams and individuals, keeping you informed, and approaching
    this transition period with care and transparency.
