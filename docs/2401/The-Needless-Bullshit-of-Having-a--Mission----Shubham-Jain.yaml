    themselves to a noble goal. Asana is a project management tool. It is helping
    humanity, somehow? At best, Lyft is a better taxi service, but no, that’d be too
    uninspiring. We should thank the company’s leadership that they stopped short
    of saying that they are reducing income inequality.

    noble mission is essential to motivate employees. Personally, I haven’t seen it
    happen. In fact, I’d say most of the employees easily sense the BS behind them
    and care less about the company. Do Instagram’s dark patterns go well with Meta’s
    mission to “bring the world closer together”? I hope not and don’t think employees
    who worked on them say otherwise.

    of autonomy employees have, the quality of products being shipped, and having
    impressive people as seniors and leaders, who have good product vision. In short,
    it’s the work itself, not how it’s tied in humanitarian goals.'

    the world. It’s impressive for multiple reasons: the number of genre-defining
    titles they have shipped, the breadth of their work (VR, Steam, Hardware), and
    how it has maintained its flat structure over the years. When they were working
    on Half-Life 2, this is what Gabe Newell had to say:'

    is basically pointless? If Half-Life 2 isn’t viewed as the best PC game of all
    time, it’s going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team.

    to fund the project himself if necessary. This is the kind of thing that drives
    employees to do their best: “to create the best FPS world has ever seen”, not
    wrapping a crappy product in some altruistic goal.'

    some of them do make sense and describe the company’s culture and the products
    they ship.

- en: However, I would appreciate if startups just cut the crap about socially concerned
    goals. Asana’s mission could be about building the best set of productivity tools.
    Lyft’s could be about creating an accessible and affordable taxi service. What
    matters isn’t the grandiosity of the mission but being honest and doing justice
    to what the startup does.
