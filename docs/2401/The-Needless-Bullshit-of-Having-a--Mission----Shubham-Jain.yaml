    themselves to a noble goal. Asana is a project management tool. It is helping
    humanity, somehow? At best, Lyft is a better taxi service, but no, that’d be too
    uninspiring. We should thank the company’s leadership that they stopped short
    of saying that they are reducing income inequality.

    noble mission is essential to motivate employees. Personally, I haven’t seen it
    happen. In fact, I’d say most of the employees easily sense the BS behind them
    and care less about the company. Do Instagram’s dark patterns go well with Meta’s
    mission to “bring the world closer together”? I hope not and don’t think employees
    who worked on them say otherwise.

    it’s the work itself, not how it’s tied in humanitarian goals.'

    the world. It’s impressive for multiple reasons: the number of genre-defining
    titles they have shipped, the breadth of their work (VR, Steam, Hardware), and
    how it has maintained its flat structure over the years. When they were working
    on Half-Life 2, this is what Gabe Newell had to say:'

    is basically pointless? If Half-Life 2 isn’t viewed as the best PC game of all
    time, it’s going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team.

    to fund the project himself if necessary. This is the kind of thing that drives
    employees to do their best: “to create the best FPS world has ever seen”, not
    wrapping a crappy product in some altruistic goal.'

    goals. Asana’s mission could be about building the best set of productivity tools.
    Lyft’s could be about creating an accessible and affordable taxi service. What
    matters isn’t the grandiosity of the mission but being honest and doing justice
    to what the startup does.

  zh: 但是，我希望创业公司可以停止对社会关注的目标进行花言巧语。Asana的使命可以是建立最好的生产力工具集。Lyft的使命可以是创建一个易于接触且价格实惠的出租车服务。重要的不是使命的宏大，而是诚实并对创业公司所做的事情进行公正的对待。
