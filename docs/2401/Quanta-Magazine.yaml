    But the deepest water sample contained so much gas that as it surfaced, bubbles
    formed in the tube, a phenomenon similar to what happens when you crack open a
    fresh can of soda.

    enormous number of samples — studying the water chemistry, identifying microbes,
    characterizing the rocks, and more. “People are going to do a whole alphabet soup
    of elemental analyses on these rocks,” said [Andrew McCaig](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1409/dr-andrew-mccaig),
    a geologist at the University of Leeds who co-led the expedition.

    even reach 122 degrees Celsius, the currently known limit for life (though [some
    studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967063721001436)
    suggest that the limit might sit even higher). Lang cautions that the models require
    confirmation because they’re based on measurements taken when the borehole temperatures
    were slightly suppressed by the cool waters circulating during drilling. If conditions
    are confirmed to be this extreme, though, the depth would allow scientists to
    study life-fueling chemical reactions without the muddling influence of microbes.

    origins. “On Earth today, it’s really hard to witness abiotic or prebiotic chemistry
    because life dominates; life is everywhere,” said [Laurie Barge](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/barge/),
    an astrobiologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not part of the
    expedition.

    the borehole water. Formate is one of the simplest compounds that can form abiotically,
    from reactions between carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and it may mark an initial
    step toward the first glimmers of life on early Earth.

    reactions with formate could produce larger organic compounds like amino acids,
    which can be strung together into molecules essential for life, such as enzymes
    and other proteins.

    deep in the borehole may have formed without microbial help, as it has in the
    shallower subsurface nearby, but more testing is needed to be sure. The water
    also contains methane, a compound that some scientists think was vital for early
    metabolisms and one that could be generated abiotically from reactions with hydrogen.
    But how methane forms at Lost City is another mystery — it’s “complicated and
    confusing,” Brazelton said.

    testing prebiotic chemistry, where researchers can tweak the conditions to more
    closely simulate early Earth or other worlds, Barge explained. “Lost City is a
    really special place,” she said.

- en: Even if the deep borehole isn’t devoid of life, the almost unprecedented quantity
    of recovered rocky cores will help scientists link shifts in water chemistry and
    rock types to the few microbes that may eke out a living underground. Studying
    how microbes survive amid scarce subsurface resources — perhaps by eating hydrogen
    and other abiotically formed compounds — could help sharpen our picture of early
    life.

    to turn hydrogen and small organic compounds into energy. “The whole idea here
    is that you have chemistry going on in rocks, and at some point, that chemistry
    turns into life,” Brazelton said. Those enzymes might just be the knob that helps
    researchers rewind the evolutionary clock to decipher how the earliest metabolisms
    came to be.

    catch deep microbes in action, explained [Fengping Wang](https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/en/szTeachers/4029.html),
    the geomicrobiologist leading this work at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Wang
    has been studying life in the subsurface for almost two decades, but she and other
    deep-biosphere researchers have largely searched for microbes hiding in ocean
    sediments. “We know very little about the rock microbes,” she said. “It’s one
    of the last questions in the deep biosphere: What’s in the hard rocks?”'
