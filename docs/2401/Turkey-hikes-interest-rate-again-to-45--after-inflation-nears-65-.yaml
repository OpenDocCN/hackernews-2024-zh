    if they are to have success in bringing inflation back down to single digits,"
    Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at London-based firm Capital Economics
    wrote in a note. "Our baseline view remains that the central bank will keep rates

    the underlying trend of monthly inflation and until inflation expectations converge

    loose monetary policy by the Ankara government. The lira is down 38% against the
    dollar year to date and has lost more than 80% of its value against the greenback
    over the last five years.
