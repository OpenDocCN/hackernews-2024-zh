    Research on job postings found that remote work is far more common for higher
    paid roles, for roles that require more experience, for full-time work, and for
    roles that require more education. Managers should be aware of this divide, as
    it has the potential to create toxic dynamics within teams and to sap morale.  <content

    work has exploded since the pandemic struck, and employees like it. In speaking
    to hundreds of managers about this development, one concern crops up again and
    again: The shift to remote work is highly unequal. Front-line staff with modest
    paychecks rarely enjoy the benefits of working from home. Instead, they commute
    every workday to engage customers and coworkers, operate machinery, and look after
    facilities. In contrast, highly paid professionals and managers often work from
    home two or three days a week — saving time, money, and aggravation. Business
    leaders rightly worry that this divide could hurt morale among front-line staff,
    undermine perceived fairness, and create new rifts in the workforce.</content>'
