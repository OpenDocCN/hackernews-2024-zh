    In 1988, the French sociologist Michel Maffesoli wrote a book called *The Time
    of the Tribes*, arguing that the next era will see more agency exercised in groups
    defined by common interests, rather than common history or blood and soil. More
    recently, Balaji Srinivasan wrote *The Network State*, arguing that communities
    defined by common interests can start off as purely online discussion forums,
    but then “materialize” into in-person hubs over time. From the perspective of
    economic democracy, David de Ugarte’s *Phyles* advocated for cultural and economic
    collaboration between transnational groups that would coordinate both online and
    offline.

    conferences fit thousands of people, but each conference only lasts a week. That
    is enough time to have serendipitous meetings, but not enough to have connections

    many of those who left are Russia’s best and brightest, serving the function of
    weakening an aggressive power and setting an example to others who might do the
