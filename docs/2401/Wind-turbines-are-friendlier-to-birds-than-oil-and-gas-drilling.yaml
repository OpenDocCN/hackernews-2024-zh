- en: BIRDERS GET nervous when they see landscapes covered in wind turbines. When
    the wind gets going, their blades can spin at well over 200km per hour. It is
    easy to imagine careless birds getting chopped to bits. Campaigners often point
    to the possibility when opposing the building of new wind farms.

- en: No one doubts that wind turbines do indeed kill at least some birds. But a new
    analysis of American data, published in *Environmental Science & Technology*,
    suggests the numbers are negligible, and have little impact on bird populations.
