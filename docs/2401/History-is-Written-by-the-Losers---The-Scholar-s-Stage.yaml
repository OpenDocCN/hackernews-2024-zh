    it in Greece; Sima Qian did it in China. Of the other great civilizations—the
    Mesoamericans, the Egyptians, Summerians, and their descendants, the Andean kingdoms,
    the early rulers of the Eurasian steppe, the great empires that sprouted up along
    the Indus and Ganges rivers, along with their cultural satellites across South
    and Southeast Asia—history is nowhere to be found. I remember my shock when I
    discovered our knowledge of ancient India relies more on ancient Greek historians
    than ancient Indian historians. Traditional Indic civilization simply did not
    have any. In ancient India, playwrights, poets, lyricists, grammarians, philosophers,
    story-tellers, mathematicians, military strategists, religious authorities, and
    religious upstarts all put pen [to palm frond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript),
    leaving a treasury of Sanskrit literature for the future. This literature is sophisticated.
    It is meaningful. Even in translation, much of it is beautiful. But search as
    you may, nowhere in this vast treasury will you ever find a work of history. That
    a great thinker could profitably spend his time sorting through evidence, trying
    to tie together cause and effect, distinguishing truth from legend, then present
    what is found in a written historical narrative—it is an idea that seems to have
    never occurred to anyone on the entire subcontinent. Only in Greece and in China
    did this notion catch hold. The work of every historian who ever lived finds its
    genesis in one of these two places—and with one of these two people.

    The best of men die to avoid disgrace to their forbears; the next best to avoid
    disgrace to their persons; the next to avoid disgrace to their dignity; the next
    to avoid disgrace to their word. And then there are those who suffer the disgrace

    commit suicide before submitting to the procedure. Everyone expected Sima Qian

    class, a group whose power was slowly stripped away as Tacitus wrote his chronicles.
    Sima Guang, the second most significant historian of Chinese history, only finished
    his massive [*Zizhi Tongjian*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizhi_Tongjian) after
    court rivalries had forced him to retire. The history of the Mongols was written

    man in this war to receive the official honors of Sparta” (2.25). Brasidas, whose
    strategems almost defeated the Athenians at sea (2.86-87). Brasidas, the daring
    leading who almost stormed the fort at Pylos (4.12). Brasidas, the savior of Megara

    Thessaly into revolt (4.84). Brasidas, the general who defeated Thucydides.

    part mankind is not so talented. Sima Guang would never have finished his history
    had he not been shunted out of Song court politics. Had Thucydides defeated Brasidas,
    he would be known today not as a historian, but as a military strategist, a strategist
    who never had the time to travel the world and collect the material needed to
    write his history. Even winning historians need time in defeat to write their
    histories—had Churchill’s party not been kicked out of power by British voters
    after the Second World War was over, Churchill’s famous account of that war would
    never have been written.

    power denied, there is little one can do about it—except write. History is thus
    rarely a “weapon of the weak.” The judgments of the historian do not serve the
    margins. They do not even serve the masses. They are a weapon in the hand of defeated
    elites, the voices of men and women who could be in power, but are not. What was
    true in Thucydides day is true in our own. The simplest explanation for modern
    academics’ hostility to 21st century capitalism’s  “structures of power” is their
    complete exclusion from them.

    Cleon’s name remember him as terrible; those who recognize the name Brasidas think
    immediately of daring brilliance. I am sure nothing would have made Thucydides
    happier. As he wished they would be, this loser’s scathing judgments have lasted
