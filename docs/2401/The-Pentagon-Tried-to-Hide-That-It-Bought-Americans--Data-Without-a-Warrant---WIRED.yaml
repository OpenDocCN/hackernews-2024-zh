- en: United States officials fought to conceal details of arrangements between US
    spy agencies and private companies tracking the whereabouts of Americans via their
    cell phones. Obtaining location data from US phones normally requires a warrant,
    but police and intelligence agencies routinely pay companies instead for the data,
    effectively circumventing the courts.

- en: Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, informed the nation’s intelligence chief,
    Avril Haines, on Thursday that the Pentagon only agreed to release details about
    the data purchases, which had always been unclassified, after Wyden hindered the
    Senate's efforts to appoint a new director of the National Security Agency. “The
    secrecy around data purchases was amplified,” Wyden wrote, “because intelligence
    agencies have sought to keep the American people in the dark."

    for years, uncovering multiple ties between the Department of Defense and what
    the senator refers to as “shady companies" committing “flagrant violations” of
    people's privacy. The companies' practices are “not just unethical, but illegal,”
    he says.

    include the Defense Intelligence Agency and the NSA, among others. Wyden's letter,

- en: Wyden's disclosure comes amid a fight in the US House of Representatives over
    efforts to outlaw the purchases entirely. Last month, members of the House Judiciary
    Committee attached legislation doing so, known as the *Fourth Amendment Is Not
    For Sale Act*, to a bill reauthorizing a contentious surveillance program known
    as Section 702.

    during a showdown with rival legislation introduced by the House Intelligence
    Committee that does not seek to ban the purchases. Congressional sources tell
    WIRED the vote was called off at the last minute after Biden administration officials
    and members of the intelligence committee staged a campaign against the privacy-enhancing
    measures.

    their aides aiming to discourage support for the judiciary bill—the *Protect Liberty
    Act*—alleging that new warrant requirements would be overly burdensome for law
    enforcement, despite a slew of exemptions for cyberwarfare, terrorism, and espionage
    threats.

    members used images of Hamas militants in presentations to drive home its argument
    for relaxing limits on domestic surveillance. The message, Republican aides said,
    was, “it could happen here.” Three Democrats who attended meetings with representatives
    from the FBI, CIA, and NSA, among other agencies, described the presentation as
    a “scare tactic.”

    the passing of routine legislation, has largely focused on Section 702, an authority
    under which the government monitors the calls, texts, and emails of foreign nationals.

    Reform and Reauthorization Act*—aim to reauthorize Section 702 into the future.
    In how that''s accomplished the bills are radically different. With access by
    the FBI to foreign intelligence for domestic investigations being the biggest
    point of contention, federal lawmakers can now effectively be divided into two
    factions: people who support surveillance warrants and people who don''t.'

    month, with its provisions banning the government from buying data as a means
