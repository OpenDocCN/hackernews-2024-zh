    should have been impossible, and a valve was left open, a pipe ruptured, a technician
    was trapped in a crawlspace, and a small fire destroyed several workstations.
    At first the alarm was discounted: false alarms commonly rang and flashed through
    the plant like birds in a tropical rain forest. Once the seriousness of the accident
    was appreciated, the rescue crew discovered that a soft drink dispenser waiting
    to be sent out for repair blocked the room in which the radiation suits were kept.
    After moving it and entering the storage room, they learned that several of the
    oxygen tanks had been left uncharged. By the time they reached the lab the fire
    was nearly out, but smoke laced with elements from the actinide series filled
    the unit. Lying on his back above the ceiling, staring at the wormlike pattern
    of surface corrosion on the tin duct a few centimeters from his face, Timofey
    had inhaled the fumes for an hour and forty minutes. In that time he had tried
    to imagine that he was inhaling dollar bills and that once they lodged in his
    lungs and bone marrow they would bombard his body tissue with high-energy dimes,
    nickels, and quarters.'

    transfiguring secrets of the atom. For most of that life, he had been exhilarated
    by the reactor’s song of nuclear fission, the hiss of particle capture and loss.
    Highly valued for his ingenuity, Timofey carried in his head not only a detailed
    knowledge of the plant’s design, but also a precise recollection of its every
    repair and improvised alteration. He knew where the patches were and how well
    they had been executed. He knew which stated tolerances could be exceeded and
    by how much, which gauges ran hot, which ran slow, and which could be completely
    ignored. The plant managers and scientists were often forced to defer to his judgment.
    On these occasions a glitter of derision showed in his voice, as he tapped a finger
    significantly against a sheet of engineering designs and explained why there was
    only a single correct answer to the question.

    a few years earlier at the hands of a visiting scientist. No one remembered the
    details, except that she had proposed slightly altering the reaction process in
    order to produce a somewhat greater quantity of a certain isotope that she employed
    in her own research. Hovering in his stained and wrinkled white coat behind the
    half dozen plant officials whom she had been addressing, Timofey objected to the
    proposal. He said that greater quantities of the isotope would not be produced
    in the way she suggested and, in fact, could not be produced at all, according
    to well established principles of nuclear physics. Blood rushed to the woman’s
    square, fleshy, bulldog face. “Idiot!” she spat. “I’m Nuclear Section Secretary
    of the Academy of Sciences. I fucking *own* the established principles of nuclear
    physics. You’re a *technician!”* Those who were there recalled that Timofey tried
    to stand his ground, but as he began to explain the flaw in her reasoning his
    voice lost its resonance and he began to mumble, straying away from the main point.
    She cut him off, asking her audience, “Are there any other questions, any educated
    questions?” As it turned out, neither Timofey nor the scientist was ever proved
    right. The Defense Ministry rejected the proposal for reasons of economy.

    he usually joined the others in his unit at lunch in the plant’s low-ceilinged,
    windowless buffet. The room rustled with murmured complaint. Timofey could hardly
    be counted among the most embittered of the technical workers — a point sagely
    observed later. All joked with stale irony about the lapses in safety and the
    precipitous decline in their salaries caused by inflation; these comments had
    become almost entirely humorless three months earlier, when management followed
    a flurry of assuring memos, beseeching directives, and unambiguous promises with
    a failure to pay them at all. No one had been paid since.

    workplace in an old Zhiguli that he had purchased precisely so that he could arrive
    home a half hour earlier than if he had taken the tram. Against the odds set by
    personality and circumstance, he had married, late in his fourth decade, an electrical
    engineer assigned to another unit. Now, with the attentiveness he had once offered
    the reactor, Timofey often sat across the kitchen table from his wife with his
    head cocked, listening to their spindly, asthmatic eight-year-old son, Tolya,
    in the next room give ruinous commands to his toy soldiers. A serious respiratory
    ailment similar to the boy’s kept Marina from working; disability leave had brought
    a pretty bloom to her soft cheeks.

    tower with crumbling front steps and unlit hallways. In this rotted box lay a
    jewel of a two-bedroom apartment that smelled of fresh bread and meat dumplings

    by grilled shashlik in the summer, home to deer, rabbits, and even gray wolves,
    the forest stretched well beyond their sight, all the way to the city’s double-fenced

    crawlspace. He was conscious, but dazed, his eyes unfocused and his face slack.
    Surrounded by phantoms in radiation suits, Timofey saw the unit as if for the
    first time: the cracked walls, the electrical cords snaking underfoot, the scratched
    and fogged glass over the gauges, the mold-spattered valves and pipes, the disabled
    equipment piled in an unused workstation, and the frayed tubing that bypassed
    sections of missing pipe and was kept in place by electrical tape. He staggered
    from the lab, took a shower, vomited twice, disposed of his clothes, and was briefly
    examined by a medic, who took his pulse and temperature. No one looked him in
    the eye. Timofey was sent home. His colleagues were surprised when he returned
    the next day, shrugging off the accident and saying that he had a few things to
    take care of before going on the “rest leave” he had been granted as a matter
    of course. But his smile was as wan as the moon on a midsummer night, and his
    hands trembled. In any case, his colleagues were too busy to chat. The clean-up
    was chaotically underway and the normal activities of the plant had been suspended.'

    within the appropriate ministries (it was not known anywhere else), Timofey was
    sitting at a café table in the bar off the lobby of a towering Brezhnevera hotel
    on one of the boulevards that radiated from Moscow’s nucleus. A domestically made
    double-breasted sports jacket the color of milk chocolate hung from his frame
    like wash left to dry. He was only fifty years old but, lank and stooped, his
    face lined by a spiderwork of dilated veins, he looked at least fifteen years
    older, almost a veteran of the war. His skin was as gray as wet concrete, except
    for the radiation erythema inflaming the skin around his eyes and nose. Coarse
    white hair bristled from his skull. Set close beneath white caterpillar eyebrows,
    his blue eyes blazed.

    the gypsies and touts milling outside the entrance had in any case already mitigated
    the hotel’s grandeur. He recognized that the lounge area was meant to approximate
    the soaring glass and marble atria of the West, but the girders of the greenhouse
    roof impended two stories above his head, supported by walls of chipped concrete
    blocks. A line of shuttered windows ran the perimeter above the lounge, looking
    down upon it as if it were a factory floor. The single appealing amenity was the
    set of flourishing potted plants and ferns in the center of the room. As Timofey
    watched over a glass of unsipped vodka that had cost him a third of his remaining
    rubles, a fat security guard in a maroon suit flicked a cigarette butt into the
    plant beds and stalked away.

    huddled over the stained plastic tables, blowing smoke into each other’s faces.
    Occasionally they looked up from their drinks and eyed the people around them.

    a low-cut, short black dress and black leggings scowled at a newspaper.

    decided that this hick would be incapable of getting a girl on his own. Not that
    there would be too many girls around this early. He wondered if Timofey had any
    money and whether he could make him part with it. Certainly the mark would have
    enough for one of the kids in ski parkas waving down cars on the boulevard. The
    young man, called Shiv by his Moscow acquaintances (he had no friends), got up

    his cheeks and the arches beneath his eyes jutted askew. The youth wore a foreign
    blazer and a black shirt, and what looked like foreign shoes as well, a pair of
    black loafers. His dark, curly hair was cut long, lapping neatly against the top
    of his collar. Jewelry glinted from his fingers and wrists. It was impossible

    evening was still in its adolescent hours, alive to possibility. As the two cars
    lurched into the swirl of traffic on the Garden Ring road, Timofey could taste
    the unburned gasoline in the hoodlum’s exhaust. He had never before driven in
    so much traffic or seen so many foreign cars, or guessed that they would ever
    be driven so recklessly. Their rear lights flitted and spun like fireflies. At
    his every hesitation or deceleration the cars behind him flashed their headlights.
    Their drivers navigated their vehicles as if from the edges of their seats, peering
    over their dashboards, white-knuckled and grim, and as if they all carried three
    hundred grams of weaponsgrade plutonium strapped to their chests. Driving among
    Audis and Mercedes-Benzes would have thrilled Tolya, who cut pictures of them
    from magazines and cherished his small collection of mismatched models. The thought

    innocent, stabbed at him.

    though there was nothing triumphant about it, except for its big Philips billboard
    advertisement. Were all the advertisements on the Garden Ring posted in the Latin

    The few foreign goods that found their way into the city’s state-owned shops arrived
    dented and tattered, as if produced in Asian, European, and North American factories
    by demoralized Russian workers. Well, these days 16 was much less of a city. It
    was not uncommon to see chickens and other small livestock grazing in the gravel
    between the high-rises, where pensioners and unpaid workers had taken up subsistence

    as original sin. Since its first synthesis in 1941 (what did Seaborg do with that
    magical, primeval stone of his own creation? put it in his vault? was it still
    there?) more than a thousand metric tons of the element had been produced. It
    was still being manufactured, not only in Russia, but in France and Britain as
    well, and it remained stockpiled in America. Nearly all of it was locked in steel
    containers, buried in mines, or sealed in glass — safe, safe, safe. But the very
    minimal fraction that wasn’t secured, the few flakes that had escaped in nuclear
    tests, reactor accidents, transport mishaps, thefts, and leakages, veiled the
    entire planet. Sometime within the next three months Timofey would die with plutonium
    in his body, joined in the same year by thousands of other victims in Russia and
    around the world. His body would be brought directly to the city crematorium,
    abstractly designed in jaggedly cut, pale yellow concrete so as to be vaguely
    “life-affirming,” where the chemistry of his skin and lungs, heart and head, would
    be transformed by fire and wind. In the rendering oven, the Pu-239 would oxidize
    and engage in wanton couplings with other substances, but it would always stay
    faithful to its radioactive, elemental properties. Some of it would remain in
    the ash plowed back to the earth; the rest would be borne aloft into the vast
    white skies arching above the frozen plain. Dust to dust.

    a chromosome sequence is deleted, an oncogene is activated. It would show up only
    in statistics, where it remained divorced from the lives and deaths of individuals.
    It was just as well, Timofey thought, that we couldn’t take in the enormity of
    the threat; if we did, we would be paralyzed with fear — not for ourselves, but
    for our children. We couldn’t wrap our minds around it; we could think of it only

    soaked in pesticides, the liquefied remains of electrical batteries, leaded gasoline
    exhaust, dioxin, nitrates, toxic waste metals, dyes, and deadly viral organisms
    generated in untreated sewage — the entire carcinogenic and otherwise malevolent
    slough of the great Soviet industrial empire. Like Homo Sovieticus himself, Timofey

    bone, fragmented membranes, and oxygen-deprived blood. Perhaps his nation’s casual
