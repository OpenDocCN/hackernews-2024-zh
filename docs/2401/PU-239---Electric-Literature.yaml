    should have been impossible, and a valve was left open, a pipe ruptured, a technician
    was trapped in a crawlspace, and a small fire destroyed several workstations.
    At first the alarm was discounted: false alarms commonly rang and flashed through
    the plant like birds in a tropical rain forest. Once the seriousness of the accident
    was appreciated, the rescue crew discovered that a soft drink dispenser waiting
    to be sent out for repair blocked the room in which the radiation suits were kept.
    After moving it and entering the storage room, they learned that several of the
    oxygen tanks had been left uncharged. By the time they reached the lab the fire
    was nearly out, but smoke laced with elements from the actinide series filled
    the unit. Lying on his back above the ceiling, staring at the wormlike pattern
    of surface corrosion on the tin duct a few centimeters from his face, Timofey
    had inhaled the fumes for an hour and forty minutes. In that time he had tried
    to imagine that he was inhaling dollar bills and that once they lodged in his
    lungs and bone marrow they would bombard his body tissue with high-energy dimes,
    nickels, and quarters.'

    transfiguring secrets of the atom. For most of that life, he had been exhilarated
    by the reactor’s song of nuclear fission, the hiss of particle capture and loss.
    Highly valued for his ingenuity, Timofey carried in his head not only a detailed
    knowledge of the plant’s design, but also a precise recollection of its every
    repair and improvised alteration. He knew where the patches were and how well
    they had been executed. He knew which stated tolerances could be exceeded and
    by how much, which gauges ran hot, which ran slow, and which could be completely
    ignored. The plant managers and scientists were often forced to defer to his judgment.
    On these occasions a glitter of derision showed in his voice, as he tapped a finger
    significantly against a sheet of engineering designs and explained why there was
    only a single correct answer to the question.

  zh: 蒂莫菲一直在16号工作，几乎他整个成年生活都在那里，被信任掌握着原子的丰富、变换的秘密。在他的大部分生活中，他被反应堆的核裂变之歌所激励，被粒子捕获和损失的嘶嘶声所鼓舞。由于他的聪明才智而备受重视，蒂莫菲不仅头脑中装着工厂的设计细节，还对每一次维修和临时修改都有精确的回忆。他知道补丁在哪里，以及它们执行得有多好。他知道哪些规定容忍度可以超出，以及超出多少，哪些仪表跑得快，哪些跑得慢，哪些可以完全忽略。工厂的经理和科学家们经常不得不听从他的判断。在这些场合，他的声音中会闪烁出一丝嘲讽，他用手指重重敲击着一张工程设计图，并解释为什么只有一个正确答案。
- en: After Timofey’s death, his colleagues recalled a dressing down he had received
    a few years earlier at the hands of a visiting scientist. No one remembered the
    details, except that she had proposed slightly altering the reaction process in
    order to produce a somewhat greater quantity of a certain isotope that she employed
    in her own research. Hovering in his stained and wrinkled white coat behind the
    half dozen plant officials whom she had been addressing, Timofey objected to the
    proposal. He said that greater quantities of the isotope would not be produced
    in the way she suggested and, in fact, could not be produced at all, according
    to well established principles of nuclear physics. Blood rushed to the woman’s
    square, fleshy, bulldog face. “Idiot!” she spat. “I’m Nuclear Section Secretary
    of the Academy of Sciences. I fucking *own* the established principles of nuclear
    physics. You’re a *technician!”* Those who were there recalled that Timofey tried
    to stand his ground, but as he began to explain the flaw in her reasoning his
    voice lost its resonance and he began to mumble, straying away from the main point.
    She cut him off, asking her audience, “Are there any other questions, any educated
    questions?” As it turned out, neither Timofey nor the scientist was ever proved
    right. The Defense Ministry rejected the proposal for reasons of economy.

  zh: 蒂莫菲去世后，他的同事们回忆起几年前一位访问科学家对他的严厉批评。没有人记得具体细节，只记得她曾提出稍微改变反应过程以产生某种同位素的建议，而这种同位素在她自己的研究中使用。站在她面前的半打工厂官员中，蒂莫菲穿着污渍斑斑、皱巴巴的白大衣，反对了这个提议。他说，按照核物理学的成熟原理，不可能按照她建议的方式产生更多的同位素，实际上根本不可能产生更多。女人的方方正正、肉感、斗牛犬般的脸上涌上了血色。“白痴！”她吐了口唾沫。“我是科学院核物理学部的秘书。我他妈的
    *掌握* 核物理学的成熟原理。你是一个 *技术人员*！”在场的人回忆起蒂莫菲试图坚持立场，但当他开始解释她推理的错误时，他的声音失去了共鸣，开始喃喃自语，偏离了主要观点。她打断了他，问她的听众，“还有其他问题吗，有受过教育的问题吗？”事实证明，无论是蒂莫菲还是科学家都没有被证明是正确的。国防部因为经济原因拒绝了这项提议。
- en: Timofey’s relations with his coworkers were more comfortable, if distant, and
    he usually joined the others in his unit at lunch in the plant’s low-ceilinged,
    windowless buffet. The room rustled with murmured complaint. Timofey could hardly
    be counted among the most embittered of the technical workers — a point sagely
    observed later. All joked with stale irony about the lapses in safety and the
    precipitous decline in their salaries caused by inflation; these comments had
    become almost entirely humorless three months earlier, when management followed
    a flurry of assuring memos, beseeching directives, and unambiguous promises with
    a failure to pay them at all. No one had been paid since.

- en: Every afternoon at four Timofey fled the compromises and incompetence of his
    workplace in an old Zhiguli that he had purchased precisely so that he could arrive
    home a half hour earlier than if he had taken the tram. Against the odds set by
    personality and circumstance, he had married, late in his fourth decade, an electrical
    engineer assigned to another unit. Now, with the attentiveness he had once offered
    the reactor, Timofey often sat across the kitchen table from his wife with his
    head cocked, listening to their spindly, asthmatic eight-year-old son, Tolya,
    in the next room give ruinous commands to his toy soldiers. A serious respiratory
    ailment similar to the boy’s kept Marina from working; disability leave had brought
    a pretty bloom to her soft cheeks.

    first time: the cracked walls, the electrical cords snaking underfoot, the scratched
    and fogged glass over the gauges, the mold-spattered valves and pipes, the disabled
    equipment piled in an unused workstation, and the frayed tubing that bypassed
    sections of missing pipe and was kept in place by electrical tape. He staggered
    from the lab, took a shower, vomited twice, disposed of his clothes, and was briefly
    examined by a medic, who took his pulse and temperature. No one looked him in
    the eye. Timofey was sent home. His colleagues were surprised when he returned
    the next day, shrugging off the accident and saying that he had a few things to
    take care of before going on the “rest leave” he had been granted as a matter
    of course. But his smile was as wan as the moon on a midsummer night, and his

- en: Early one evening a week after the “event,” as it was known in the plant and
    within the appropriate ministries (it was not known anywhere else), Timofey was
    sitting at a café table in the bar off the lobby of a towering Brezhnevera hotel
    on one of the boulevards that radiated from Moscow’s nucleus. A domestically made
    double-breasted sports jacket the color of milk chocolate hung from his frame
    like wash left to dry. He was only fifty years old but, lank and stooped, his
    face lined by a spiderwork of dilated veins, he looked at least fifteen years
    older, almost a veteran of the war. His skin was as gray as wet concrete, except
    for the radiation erythema inflaming the skin around his eyes and nose. Coarse
    white hair bristled from his skull. Set close beneath white caterpillar eyebrows,
    his blue eyes blazed.

    the gypsies and touts milling outside the entrance had in any case already mitigated
    the hotel’s grandeur. He recognized that the lounge area was meant to approximate
    the soaring glass and marble atria of the West, but the girders of the greenhouse
    roof impended two stories above his head, supported by walls of chipped concrete
    blocks. A line of shuttered windows ran the perimeter above the lounge, looking
    down upon it as if it were a factory floor. The single appealing amenity was the
    set of flourishing potted plants and ferns in the center of the room. As Timofey
    watched over a glass of unsipped vodka that had cost him a third of his remaining
    rubles, a fat security guard in a maroon suit flicked a cigarette butt into the
    plant beds and stalked away.

    huddled over the stained plastic tables, blowing smoke into each other’s faces.
    Occasionally they looked up from their drinks and eyed the people around them.

    decided that this hick would be incapable of getting a girl on his own. Not that
    there would be too many girls around this early. He wondered if Timofey had any
    money and whether he could make him part with it. Certainly the mark would have

    his cheeks and the arches beneath his eyes jutted askew. The youth wore a foreign
    blazer and a black shirt, and what looked like foreign shoes as well, a pair of
    black loafers. His dark, curly hair was cut long, lapping neatly against the top

- en: Plutonium. There was no exit for the stuff. It was as permanent and universal
    as original sin. Since its first synthesis in 1941 (what did Seaborg do with that
    magical, primeval stone of his own creation? put it in his vault? was it still
    there?) more than a thousand metric tons of the element had been produced. It
    was still being manufactured, not only in Russia, but in France and Britain as
    well, and it remained stockpiled in America. Nearly all of it was locked in steel
    containers, buried in mines, or sealed in glass — safe, safe, safe. But the very
    minimal fraction that wasn’t secured, the few flakes that had escaped in nuclear
    tests, reactor accidents, transport mishaps, thefts, and leakages, veiled the
    entire planet. Sometime within the next three months Timofey would die with plutonium
    in his body, joined in the same year by thousands of other victims in Russia and
    around the world. His body would be brought directly to the city crematorium,
    abstractly designed in jaggedly cut, pale yellow concrete so as to be vaguely
    “life-affirming,” where the chemistry of his skin and lungs, heart and head, would
    be transformed by fire and wind. In the rendering oven, the Pu-239 would oxidize
    and engage in wanton couplings with other substances, but it would always stay
    faithful to its radioactive, elemental properties. Some of it would remain in
    the ash plowed back to the earth; the rest would be borne aloft into the vast
    white skies arching above the frozen plain. Dust to dust.

    a chromosome sequence is deleted, an oncogene is activated. It would show up only
    in statistics, where it remained divorced from the lives and deaths of individuals.
    It was just as well, Timofey thought, that we couldn’t take in the enormity of
    the threat; if we did, we would be paralyzed with fear — not for ourselves, but
    for our children. We couldn’t wrap our minds around it; we could think of it only

    bone, fragmented membranes, and oxygen-deprived blood. Perhaps his nation’s casual

  zh: “听着，我只是试图向你解释” — Shiv 思考了一会儿 — “这个物质的放射性质。”
- en: Shiv was too close to be surprised, it happened too quickly. In one moment he
    was trying to reason with Andrei, intimidate him, and was only beginning to appreciate
    the seriousness of the problem, and had just observed, in a casual way, that the
    entire time of his life up to the moment he had stepped out of Timofey’s car seemed
    equal in length to the time since then, and in the next moment he was unconscious,
    bleeding from a large wound in his head.

  zh: Shiv 离得太近，以至于没有感到惊讶，一切发生得太快。在某一刻，他试图与安德烈理论，威胁他，刚刚开始意识到问题的严重性，刚刚以一种随意的方式观察到，他一生中的所有时间直到他从
    Timofey 的车里走出来的那一刻似乎与那时以来的时间长度相等，下一刻他就失去了意识，头部有一个大口子在流血。
- en: “Well, fuck you,” said Andrei, or, more literally, “go to a fucked mother.”
    He had never shot a man before, and he was surprised and frightened by the blood,
    which had splattered all over Shiv’s clothes, and even on himself. He had expected
    that the impact of the shot would have propelled Shiv off the bridge, but it hadn’t.
    Shiv lay there at his feet, bleeding against the rear tire. The sound of the little
    gun was tremendous; it continued roaring through the woods long after Andrei had
    brought the weapon to his side.

  zh: “去你的吧，”安德烈说，更确切地说是“去他妈的”。他从未开枪打过人，他对这血迹感到惊讶和害怕，血迹洒满了希夫的衣服，甚至还弄到了自己身上。他本来以为枪击的冲击会把希夫推下桥，但没想到没有。希夫倒在他脚边，靠在后轮胎上流血。那支小枪的声音很响亮，即使在安德烈把武器放在身边之后，它仍在林间长时间地轰鸣。
- en: Neither brother said anything for a while. In fact, they weren’t brothers, as
    everyone believed, but were stepbrothers, as well as in-laws, in some kind of
    complicated way that neither had ever figured out. From Yegor’s silence, Andrei
    guessed that he was angry with him for shooting Shiv. They hadn’t agreed to shoot
    him beforehand. But Yegor had allowed him to carry the gun, which meant Andrei
    had the right to make the decision. Yegor couldn’t second-guess him, Andrei resolved,
    his nostrils flaring.

  zh: 有段时间，两个兄弟都没有说话。事实上，正如大家所认为的那样，他们并不是兄弟，而是继兄弟，也是某种复杂关系中的姻亲，这种关系他们从未理清。从叶戈的沉默中，安德烈猜到他对自己枪击希夫感到愤怒。他们之前没商量好要枪击他。但叶戈允许他携带枪支，这意味着安德烈有权做出决定。安德烈下定决心，叶戈不能质疑他，安德烈的鼻孔微扩。
- en: But Yegor broke the long silence with a gasped guffaw. In the bark of his surprise
    lay a tremor of anxiety. “Look at this mess,” he said. “You fucking near tore
    off his head.”

- en: Andrei scowled but quickly ran his hands through Shiv’s trousers, jacket, and
    coat anyway. The body stirred and something like a groan bubbled from Shiv’s bloodfilled
    mouth. Some of the blood trickled onto Andrei’s hand. It was disgustingly warm
    and viscid. He snatched his hand away and wiped it on Shiv’s jacket. Taking more
    care now, he reached into the inside jacket pocket and pulled out a gold-colored
    money clip with some rubles, about ten twenty dollar bills, a few tens, and a
    creased five. He slipped the clip and four or five of the twenties into his pocket
    and, stacking the rest on the car’s trunk, announced, “Not much, just some cash.”

  zh: 安德烈皱起眉头，但还是快速地把手伸进希夫的裤子、夹克和外套中。尸体动了一下，从希夫满是血的嘴里冒出类似呻吟的声音。一些血液滴在安德烈的手上。那令人恶心的温热黏稠。他抽回手，用希夫的夹克擦拭。现在更加小心地，他伸手进内侧夹克口袋，拿出一个金色的钱夹，里面有一些卢布、大约十张二十美元的钞票、几张十元钞票和一张折痕明显的五元钞票。他把钱夹和四、五张二十美元的钞票塞进口袋里，将其余的叠放在汽车后备箱上宣称，“不多，就是些银子。”

- en: He placed it next to the money and pulled off the top, revealing inside a coarse,
    silvery gray powder. Yegor grimaced. It was nothing like he had ever seen. He
    wet his finger, poked it into the container, and removed a fingerprint’s worth.
    The stuff tasted chalky.

  zh: 他把它放在钱旁边，拔掉顶部，露出里面的一种粗糙的、银灰色的粉末。叶戈尔皱了皱眉头。这根本不像他以前见过的任何东西。他把手指弄湿，戳进容器里，取出了一个指纹的份量。这东西的味道有点像白垩。

    stuff up to his face. He loved doing this. From the moment he had pulled the gun
    on Shiv he had felt as if he were in Chicago or Miami. He sniffed up the powder.

  zh: 安德烈伸手进去，捏了一小撮粉末，放在左手背上。然后他用手指捏住右鼻孔，把东西放到脸上。他喜欢这样做。从他拔枪指向希夫的那一刻起，他就感觉自己仿佛身处芝加哥或迈阿密。他吸了一口气。
- en: It burned, but not in the right way. It was as if someone — Yegor — had grabbed
    his nostril with a pair of hot pliers. The pain shot through his head like a nail,
    and he saw stars. Then he saw atoms, their nuclei surrounded by hairy penumbrae
    of indeterminately placed electrons. The nuclei themselves pulsed with indeterminacy,
    their masses slightly less than the sum of their parts. Bombarded by neutrons,
    the nuclei were drastically deformed. Some burst. The repulsion of two highly
    charged nuclear fragments released Promethean, adamantine energy, as well as excess
    neutrons that bounced among the other nuclei, a cascade of excitation and transformation.

  zh: 它燃烧了，但不是正确的方式。就像有人——叶戈尔——用一把热钳子抓住了他的鼻孔一样。疼痛像一根钉子穿过他的头，他看到了星星。然后他看到了原子，它们的核被毛茸茸的不确定地放置的电子包围着。核本身充满了不确定性，它们的质量略小于其部分之和。受中子轰击，核被严重变形。一些核爆炸了。两个高度带电的核碎片的排斥释放出普罗米修斯、坚硬的能量，以及多余的中子在其他核之间弹跳，形成了一系列的激发和变换。

    with a grunt and a cry, hurled it far into the night sky. The canister sailed.
    For a moment, as it reached the top of its ascent beyond the bridge, it caught
    a piece of moonlight along its sides. It looked like a little crescent moon itself,
    in an eternal orbit above the earth, the stuff forever pluming behind it. And
    then it very swiftly vanished. Everything was quiet for a moment, and then there
    was a distant, voluptuous sound as the container plunged into the river. As the
    two brothers turned toward each other, one of them with a gun, everything was
    quiet again.
