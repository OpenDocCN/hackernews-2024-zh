- en: IF WALT DISNEY were still alive, he would be dismayed at the new film role given
    to his signature character, Mickey Mouse, as a slasher hunting teenagers in an
    old arcade. The trailer for “Mickey’s Mouse Trap” was released on January 1st.
    That is the day the copyright of “Steamboat Willie”, the short film that introduced
    Mickey Mouse’s character in 1928, expired. This early version of Mickey is now
    [in the public domain](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/a-treasure-trove-of-hollywood-intellectual-property-is-heading-for-the-public-domain).

- en: Even before the arrival of a murderous mouse, the field of copyright has been
    full of dramatic turns, as a new book, “Who Owns This Sentence?”, recounts. That
    is because “copyright is an edifice of words resting on a long and complicated
    string of metaphors and double meanings,” write the authors David Bellos, a professor
    at Princeton, and Alexandre Montagu, a lawyer. Over centuries artists, authors,
    lobbyists, publishers and public officials have defined and redefined the meaning
    of copyright, with debate and legal changes happening beyond the public eye.
