- en: Since we introduced Google Assistant seven years ago, it’s been incredible to
    see how voice technology has transformed the way we get things done at home and
    work. Today, Assistant helps hundreds of millions of people around the world cross
    off their to-do lists.

- en: Over the years, we’ve made it even easier to accomplish your tasks with Assistant
    — thanks, in large part, to your feedback. And in order to keep improving your
    experience and build the best Assistant yet, we’re making a few changes to focus
    on quality and reliability — ultimately making it easier to use Assistant across
    devices.

- en: First, as we continue to make Google Assistant more helpful, we're prioritizing
    the experiences you love and investing in the underlying technology to make them
    even better — which means that some underutilized features will no longer be supported.
    You can find [a list](http://support.google.com/assistant/?p=assistant_is_changing)
    of these features, including suggestions of what you can use in place of them
    (where alternatives are available). Beginning on January 26, when you ask for
    one of these features, you may get a notification that it won’t be available after
    a certain date.

    The microphone icon will now trigger Search results in response to your queries,
    which is its most popular use case. You can continue to activate Assistant as
    you always have: Just say “Hey Google” or long press on the home or power button
    (on select phones) on [Android](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7172657),
    or open the Google Assistant app on [iOS](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7172657?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=0).
    But you’ll no longer be able to use the [microphone icon](https://support.google.com/websearch?p=mic_update)
    in the Search bar to complete actions like “turn on the lights” or “send a message.”
    This includes the microphone in the Pixel Search bar, which will now activate
    Voice Search instead of Assistant. And to ensure you have access to the best,
    most up-to-date version of Google Assistant, you’ll be prompted to upgrade the
    Google app if you’re using an older version (v12 and older).'

    transitions as smooth as possible. While Google Assistant has evolved a lot over
    the last seven years, one thing remains true: Our improvements are driven by your
    feedback. And we want to hear it. Just say, “Hey Google, send feedback” and share
    your comments with us.'
