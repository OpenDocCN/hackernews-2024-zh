    Hallam, a former communications director for the Chicago Bulls. In the spring
    of 1991, the Bulls were preparing for their first NBA Finals, against Magic Johnson’s
    aging Lakers, when Hallam approached Michael Jordan, the team’s superstar, to
    ask him for a kindness. If, as expected, the Bulls won, would Jordan give him
    a shoe from the clinching game? Jordan agreed, the Bulls won, and, in the confetti
    frenzy of tears and champagne that followed, he made good. Then, after the Bulls
    won their second championship 12 months later, Jordan did it again. Perhaps unwilling
    to displease or otherwise disturb the hidden cosmic operations that had delivered
    him to the apex of the basketball world, he made the gift into a ritual: After
    the final buzzer sounded on each of the six titles he won with the Bulls, he’d
    pull off one of his shoes, sign it, and hand it over to Hallam.'

    company is calling it the “dynasty collection” and billing it as the most significant
    set of Air Jordan sneakers ever brought to market. “It’s an unparalleled collection,”
    Dylan Dittrich, an analyst at Altan Insights who covers collectible shoes, told
    me. “It’s hard to even believe that it exists. These are shoes worn by the most
    important athlete of the century during the most pivotal games of his career.”
    For basketball fans, these are relics of the True Cross.

    has been available for purchase. Last March, Sotheby’s sent the same shoes out
    on tour to chum the waters for a private sale. They stopped in cities known for
    billionaire foot traffic: Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai. A prominent collector told
    *The Wall Street Journal* that they would go for at least $20 million. He indicated
    that he would not be surprised if they fetched *$100 million*. Those predictions
    do not appear to have panned out, because Sotheby’s now has the shoes back on
    the block for just $7–10 million. Maybe the timing for these sales has been off.
    The sports-memorabilia market has certainly come off its pandemic highs. Or maybe,
    after a nearly 10-year boom, the mystique of the Jordan brand has begun to dim.'

- en: Jordan is arguably the most successful male model in history. His brand first
    became a force in the 1980s, during his early playing career, when he embodied
    cool in his physique and in nearly everything that he wore. The first shoe to
    bear his name, the Jordan 1, was released in 1985, when “signature shoes for basketball
    players weren't really a thing,” says Russ Bengtson, the author of *A History
    of Basketball in 15 Sneakers*. It brought in $126 million in revenue. Sneakerheads
    will talk about a shoe’s “silhouette,” its three-dimensional shape stripped of
    color and texture. The Jordan 1 had the sweetest silhouette in sneaker history
    when it debuted, and may never have relinquished that title. That’s why people
    still feel comfortable wearing Jordan 1s, not only with basketball shorts, but
    with jeans, skirts, dresses, or suits. No other basketball player has so successfully
    transformed a shoe built for the court into a staple of everyday casual gear.
    Following his untimely death, Kobe Bryant’s shoes have become particularly popular,
    Bengtson told me. But people don’t wear Kobes—or LeBrons—for trips to the grocery
    store *and* the [presidential inauguration](https://www.gq.com/story/air-jordan-1-diors-inauguration)
    alike.

    continued to be popular while he was playing. After he stopped playing, the brand’s
    signature shoes became less popular, Dittrich says. Fans weren’t yet nostalgic
    for Jordan at his greatest with the Bulls. They were still seeing the afterimages
    of his more human closing years with the Washington Wizards, when he was merely
    good for his age. Jordan struggled to remain a symbol of pure victory in retirement.
    He kept releasing shoes, but they [tended](https://www.flightclub.com/air-jordan-22-og-black-dark-amber-white-010525)

    The Jordan 19s—which came out the year after he stopped playing—were even [veiled](https://stockx.com/jordan-19-og-chrome),
    as though embarrassed. Under normal circumstances, Jordan’s induction into the
    Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2009, might have brought him a surge of goodwill,
    and perhaps renewed interest in his brand. But it didn’t, in part because he gave
    a bizarrely [ungracious acceptance speech](https://www.sbnation.com/2009/9/12/1027147/jordans-speech-was-petty-ugly),
    full of score-settling and bitter grievance. Perhaps worst of all, for shoe sales,
    he was no longer regarded as being particularly stylish. To the contrary, he was
    [mocked](https://wtfismikewearing.tumblr.com/page/2) for clinging too long to
    loud sports coats, baggy jeans, and other ’90s trends.

- en: Fortunately for Jordan, a surge of interest in retro basketball sneakers was
    about to begin. Black Americans were alive to the athletic shoe as an aesthetic
    object long before the white cultural mainstream tuned in. Hobbyists, primarily
    from the hip-hop community, had for decades been collecting the most beautiful
    and resonant basketball sneakers. But the market for these shoes was small and
    fragmented. In the mid-2010s, two dedicated online marketplaces—StockX and GOAT—launched,
    and enthusiasts suddenly had an easier way to sell their Foamposite Penny Hardaways,
    or their old Air Maxes, or, most coveted of all, their retro Jordans.

    home, with nothing to do but await packages. The money printer was going *brrr*.
    [*The Last Dance*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/04/michael-jordan-the-last-dance-nba-savior/610687/),
    ESPN’s documentary about Jordan, was a staple of early COVID monoculture, and
    it played like an eight-hour commercial for his greatness. On the first three
    Sundays when episodes aired, traffic to Jordan shoes on StockX increased by more
    than 60 percent. Nike saw an opportunity, Bengtson said, and fire-hosed retro
    releases into the world. After social-distancing restrictions were lifted, you
    couldn’t go anywhere without seeing people wearing them. Most popular of all were
    the original Jordan 1s.

    Last Dance* aired. Nike could release them in almost any color combination imaginable,
    including [truly](https://www.nicekicks.com/air-jordan-1-high-og-heirloom-555088-202/)
    [terrible](https://sneakernews.com/2021/10/07/air-jordan-1-retro-high-og-volt-summer-2022-release-info/)
    ones, and count on them to sell out. Unless you were rapidly refreshing your Nike
    app on release date, you’d have to buy them for a higher price on StockX or GOAT.
    In 2020, new Jordan 1 colorways fetched a 61 percent premium over their retail
    price, Dittrich, the shoe-market analyst, told me. The 2021 releases sold at a
    50 percent premium. The shoe’s cultural currency was so potent that Amazon green-lighted
    a feature film, [*Air*](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/04/air-movie-review-nike-ben-affleck-matt-damon/673664/),
    about its origin story. Matt Damon starred as Sonny Vaccaro, a schlubby white
    executive who helped sign Jordan to Nike. Ben Affleck, who directed, played Phil
    Knight, the company’s CEO. Jordan himself is a minor character. His face is never
    shown, and he has only a single line. This movie is about *shoes*.

- en: But by the time *Air* made it to the big screen last May, the fervor for retro
    Jordans was already starting to fade. Bengtson blames Nike for flooding the market.
    “There are just so many releases every single week,” he said. Tastemakers have
    noted the glut. The fashion newsletter Blackbird Spyplane recently placed retro
    Jordans at their “Lowest Point of Coolness ever,” especially in “non-O.G. colors,
    but also, sorry, just all of them … [[Jordans] have never looked as costumey &
    washed on foot](https://www.blackbirdspyplane.com/p/spyplane-best-of-2023-slappy-awards).”
    The resale market has also shown strong symptoms of Jordan fatigue. In 2022, the
    release premium on new Jordan 1 colorways dipped to 23 percent, Dittrich told
    me. (Anecdotally, my son, who does some light reselling, reported this same downswing.)
    Through the first half of 2023, Jordan 1s actually resold at a 2 percent *discount*.

    expect Jordan fever to return, and whether it will be as intense the next time
    it strikes. Bengtson is bearish. “We’re moving further away from Jordan’s playing
    career,” he told me. “It’s gone from consumers having direct memory of watching
    him play, to stories from older brothers and friends, to stories from parents.”
    Jordan’s highlight packages still do numbers on TikTok, but there is something
    qualitatively different about consuming an algorithmic drip feed of 30-year-old
    clips while you’re on your iPhone in bed. That’s not an experience that imprints
    visceral memories. Gen Xers and even some Millennials can remember where they
    were when Jordan [elevated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ChoqrQCrE), according
    to some higher physics, and stuck a game winner on the Cleveland Cavaliers’ Craig
    Ehlo. They can still hear the involuntary way that announcer Marv Albert’s voice
    rose—[“ a *spectacular* move”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiSdb16N_Dg)—as
    Jordan soared through a forest of Lakers, moving the ball fluidly from his right
    hand to his left.

    brand,” Dittrich told me. “Somebody who is 18 years old doesn’t know the brand
    because MJ [laced up the Concord 11s](https://www.complex.com/sneakers/a/brandon-richard/air-jordan-xi-11-first-time-1995)
    when he came back to the NBA. They know the brand because Jordan shoes have recently
    sold out or have otherwise been very hard to buy.” In other words, young people
    know Jordan’s shoes. They know the formally elegant Jumpman logo. But they may
    not know much about the man himself. If the brand is going to capture a new generation,
    it will need to put out fresh products, Dittrich said: “They can’t keep leaning
    on the same old Jordans from the ’90s.”'

- en: It’s not clear whether this latest swoon has been (or will remain) a drag on
    the dynasty collection’s value. A mass-market fashion brand has to cater to fickle
    youth, but Sotheby’s doesn’t. Today’s top memorabilia buyers come from the older
    generations, who watched Jordan in his prime. Having just made partner or sold
    a business, they may be newly inclined to see something of themselves in Jordan’s
    story. In September 2022, a jersey that Jordan wore in the first game of his last
    NBA Finals went up for auction. It was estimated to sell for “only” $5 million,
    but the bidding war was more intense than anticipated, and it ultimately went
    for a higher price—$10.1 million—than even the jersey that Diego Maradona wore
    while scoring his “Hand of God” goal in the 1986 World Cup. The Jordan jersey,
    which did not come from a particularly remarkable game, is now the most expensive
    game-worn garment ever sold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recent sales of Jordan’s shoes haven’t come close to that jersey’s selling price,
    despite how central they are to his mythology. Last April, a pair that he wore
    in his last NBA Finals sold for $2.2 million, a record for sneakers but the bottom
    end of its estimated range. The ones that he wore during his famous “flu game”
    also recently came up for auction. Any basketball fan above a certain age can
    easily summon to mind the image of a sickened and exhausted Jordan slumping over
    onto Scottie Pippen on his way to the bench, having just gutted out 38 points.
    But the shoes that were on his feet at that moment sold for only $1.4 million.
    Perhaps footwear just doesn’t pop like a jersey on the illuminated wall of a plutocrat’s
    man cave. Or perhaps the very popularity of the Air Jordan brand, its continual
    reinvention and readoption by the young, has widened the psychic distance between
    the shoes and the original experience of Michael Jordan. Older collectors bid
    up his jersey because it reminds them of how he played the game. The shoes may
    now seem like trendy objects, artifacts that belong more squarely to the history
    of fashion than to basketball.
