    [delivered to the United Nations](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session)
    Ad Hoc Committee, clearly outlining civil society non-negotiable redlines for
    the [proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty](https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Documents/A_AC.291_22_Rev.1_E.pdf),
    and asserting that states should reject the proposed treaty if these essential
    changes are not implemented.

    to human rights law and standards. Initially focused on cybercrime, the proposed
    Treaty [has alarmingly evolved](https://www.euractiv.com/section/cybersecurity/opinion/un-cybercrime-treaty-a-menace-in-the-making/)
    into an expansive surveillance tool.

- en: The proposed treaty needs more than just minor adjustments; it requires a more
    focused, narrowly defined approach to tackle cybercrime. This change is essential
    to prevent the treaty from becoming a global surveillance pact rather than a tool
    for effectively combating core cybercrimes. With its wide-reaching scope and invasive
    surveillance powers, the current version raises serious concerns about cross-border
    repression and potential police overreach. Above all, human rights must be the
    treaty's cornerstone, not an afterthought. If states can't unite on these key
    points, they must outright reject the treaty.

    and security researchers, suppress dissent and whistleblowers, endanger human
    rights defenders, limit free expression, and justify unnecessary and disproportionate
    state surveillance measures. We are concerned that the proposed Treaty, as it
    stands now, will exacerbate these problems. The proposed treaty [concluding session](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/ad_hoc_committee/ahc_concluding_session/main)
    will be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from January 29 to February 10th.
    EFF will be attending in person.

- en: The [joint statement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/joint-statement-proposed-cybercrime-treaty-ahead-concluding-session)
    specifically calls States to narrow the scope of criminalization provisions to
    well defined cyber dependent crimes; shield security researchers, whistleblowers,
    activists, and journalists from being prosecuted for their legitimate activities;
    explicitly include language on international human rights law, data protection,
    and gender mainstreaming; limit the scope of the domestic criminal procedural
    measures and international cooperation to core cybercrimes established in the
    criminalization chapter; and address concerns that the current draft could weaken
    cybersecurity and encryption. Additionally, it requires the necessity to establish
    specific safeguards, such as the principles of prior judicial authorization, necessity,
    legitimate aim, and proportionality.
