    consequences—for example, that our simulation might get shut down, or we might
    find a bug or a memory overflow or a floating point error or whatever—well then,
    *of course* I care. So far, however, none of the claimed empirical consequences
    has impressed me: either they’re things physicists would’ve noticed long ago if
    they were real (e.g., spacetime “pixels” that would manifestly violate Lorentz
    and rotational symmetry), or the claim staggeringly fails to grapple with profound
    features of reality (such as quantum mechanics) by treating them as if they were
    *defects* in programming, or (most often) the claim is simply so resistant to
    falsification as to enter the realm of conspiracy theories, which I find boring.'

    asked me to respond to the quantum field theorist [David Tong](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/),
    who [gave a lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPMn7SuiHP8) arguing against
    the simulation hypothesis on an unusually specific and technical ground. This
    ground is the [fermion doubling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion_doubling):
    an issue known since the 1970s with simulating certain quantum field theories
    on computers. The issue is specific to [chiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(physics))
    QFTs—those whose fermions distinguish left from right, and clockwise from counterclockwise.
    The [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) is famously
    an example of such a chiral QFT: recall that, in her studies of the weak nuclear
    force in 1956, [Chien-Shiung Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chien-Shiung_Wu)
    proved that the force acts preferentially on left-handed particles and right-handed
    antiparticles.'

    see [Tong’s lecture](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QPMn7SuiHP8), or [this old paper](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/pubs/preskill-1986-lattice.pdf)
    by Eichten and Preskill). Suffice it to say that, when you put a fermionic quantum
    field on a lattice, a brand-new symmetry shows up, which forces there to be an
    identical left-handed particle for every right-handed particle and vice versa,
    thereby ruining the chirality. Furthermore, this symmetry *just stays there*,
    no matter how small you take the lattice spacing to be. This doubling problem
    is the main reason why Jordan, Lee, and Preskill, in their [important](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3633)
    [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7115) on simulating interacting quantum field
    theories efficiently on a quantum computer (in [BQP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP)),
    have so far been unable to handle the full Standard Model.

    issue with mathematically defining the Standard Model at all. In that respect
    it’s related to, though not the same as, other longstanding open problems around
    making nontrivial QFTs mathematically rigorous, such as the [Yang-Mills existence
    and mass gap problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium/yang-mills-the-maths-gap/)
    that carries a $1 million prize from the Clay Math Institute.'

    QFT on a lattice … and therefore, to simulating physics on a computer at all?

- en: 'Briefly: no, it almost certainly doesn’t. If you don’t believe me, just listen
    to [Tong’s own lecture](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QPMn7SuiHP8)! (Really, I recommend
    it; it’s a masterpiece of clarity.) Tong quickly admits that his claim to refute
    the simulation hypothesis is just “clickbait”—i.e., an excuse to talk about the
    fermion doubling problem—and that his “true” argument against the simulation hypothesis
    is simply that Elon Musk takes the hypothesis seriously (!).'

- en: It turns out that, for as long as there’s been a fermion doubling problem, there
    have been known methods to deal with it, though (as often the case with QFT) no
    proof that any of the methods always work. Indeed, Tong himself has been one of
    the leaders in developing these methods, and because of his and others’ work,
    some experts I talked to were optimistic that a lattice simulation of the full
    Standard Model, with “good enough” justification for its correctness, might be
    within reach. Just to give you a flavor, apparently some of the methods involve
    adding an extra dimension to space, in such a way that the *boundaries* of the
    higher-dimensional theory approximate the chiral theory you’re trying to simulate
    (better and better, as the boundaries get further and further apart), even while
    the higher-dimensional theory itself remains non-chiral. It’s yet another example
    of the general lesson that you don’t get to call an aspect of physics “noncomputable,”
    just because *the first method you thought of* for simulating it on a computer
    didn’t work.

    the other two!** As far as I can see, there aren’t even nontrivial implications
    among them. For example, even if it turned out that lattice methods couldn’t properly
    simulate the Standard Model, that would say little about whether *any* computational
    methods could do so—or even more important, whether any computational methods
    could simulate the ultimate quantum theory of gravity. A priori, simulating quantum
    gravity might be harder than “merely” simulating the Standard Model (if, e.g.,
    Roger Penrose’s [microtubule theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction)
    turned out to be right), but it might also be *easier*: for example, because of
    the finiteness of the [Bekenstein-Hawking entropy](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy),
    and perhaps the Hilbert space dimension, of any bounded region of space.'

    2 and 3\. Even if our laws of physics were *computable* in the Turing sense, that
    still wouldn’t mean that anyone or anything external was *computing* them. (By
    analogy, presumably we all accept that our spacetime can be curved without there
    being a higher-dimensional flat spacetime for it to curve in.) And conversely:
    even if Penrose was right, and our laws of physics were Turing-uncomputable—well,
    if you still want to believe the simulation hypothesis, why not knock yourself
    out? Why shouldn’t whoever’s simulating us inhabit a universe full of post-Turing
    hypercomputers, for which the [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)
