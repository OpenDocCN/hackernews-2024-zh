His daughter, Leigh, just sent me the news that Dave passed away peacefully
on January 17, 2024\. He was such an iconic element of the early Internet.
Network Time Protocol, the Fuzzball routers of the early NSFNET, INARG
taskforce lead, COMSAT Labs and University of Delaware and so much more.

R.I.P.
