    the future directly against the CVE database with no middle man, and also that
    we have a scope for CVEs that is our territory: curl and libcurl. No one else
    can now register CVEs for our products – without involving us. (There’s an appeals
    process so someone can still actually file CVEs for issues even if we say no,
    but at least there’s a process where both sides will argue their points.)'
