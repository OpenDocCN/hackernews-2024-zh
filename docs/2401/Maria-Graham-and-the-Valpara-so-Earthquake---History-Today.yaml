- en: '‘Small Earthquake in Chile, Not many dead.’ The journalist Claud Cockburn supposedly
    won a prize for dreaming up this notoriously dull newspaper headline, although
    it seems never to have been used. In contrast, the very real Valparaiso earthquake
    of 19 November 1822 was immensely newsworthy: it killed or injured around 500
    people, razed entire villages to the ground and prompted a tsunami. One on-the-spot
    eye-witness, Maria Graham, described how a 100-mile stretch of coast had been
    lifted several feet above its former level so that ‘the ancient bed of the sea
    laid bare and dry, with beds of oysters, muscles, and other shells adhering to
    the rocks on which they grew, the fish being dead and exhaling most offensive
    effluvia.’'
