- en: Mozilla, the company behind Firefox and Thunderbird, has talked a lot in recent
    years about the unfair advantages that platforms give to their first-party web
    browsers. Platform Tilt is a new effort from Mozilla to show how Firefox and other
    third-party browsers stack up against Chrome on Android, Safari on iPhone, and
    other platform pairings.

- en: 'Mozilla said in a blog post, "There’s a long history of companies leveraging
    their control of devices and operating systems to tilt the playing field in favor
    of their own browser. This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making
    it harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or resetting
    a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities to the first-party
    browser, or requiring the use of the first-party browser engine for third-party
    browsers."'

- en: Mozilla is now outlining these "tilts" in a new "Platform Tilt" issue tracker
    database, while encouraging other web browsers to publish their concerns in a
    similar fashion. The main purpose is to call more attention to how platforms like
    iOS and Windows favor their own web browser over the competition, which is useful
    information in the various [antitrust legal actions](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-apple-epic-fortnite-antitrust-iphone-c412553d88f8798acd7d5e1cbb5826bc)
    against Apple, Microsoft, and other big tech companies.

- en: There are ten issues listed with Apple, including the Apple App Store [forbiding
    third-party browser engines](https://www.howtogeek.com/184283/why-third-party-browsers-will-always-be-inferior-to-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/),
    no option to import browser data on iPhone and iPad from other web browsers, and
    difficult beta testing. On Android, Mozilla points out it can't import browser
    data, some features open Chrome instead of the default web browser, and Google
    search results on Android are worse.

- en: Mozilla also highlighted three issues with Microsoft. The process for setting
    the default browser on Windows is still difficult, and some Windows features forcibly
    open links in Edge instead of the default web browser. Microsoft also reverts
    the default browser to Edge during some Windows setup interactions. Most of those
    issues were [recently made illegal by the European Union](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23859537/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-links-eu-eea-changes),
    but Microsoft is free to continue doing them in other regions, like the United
    States.

- en: The new database is a bit like [Mozilla's WebCompat project](https://webcompat.com/),
    which documents the problems that popular websites have in Firefox and other less-popular
    web browsers. However, instead of specific sites creating a worse experience for
    Firefox users, Platform Tilt is about software platforms creating a worse experience.

  zh: 这个新数据库有点像[Mozilla 的 WebCompat 项目](https://webcompat.com/)，该项目记录了流行网站在 Firefox
    和其他不太流行的网络浏览器中存在的问题。但是，与特定网站为 Firefox 用户创建更糟糕的体验不同，平台倾斜是关于软件平台为用户创建更糟糕的体验。

    It will likely continue to be updated as Mozilla sorts through its issue trackers.
