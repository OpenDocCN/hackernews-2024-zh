- en: Scientists with Japanese space agency JAXA were [reportedly initially subdued](https://news.sky.com/story/japan-moon-landing-live-brace-for-20-minutes-of-terror-as-sniper-probe-attempts-historic-mission-13051414)
    after the landing as they waited to make contact with the spacecraft. JAXA’s director
    later declared that the probe had managed a successful soft landing since it was
    sending data back to Earth. Without functional solar panels, the probe’s battery
    will last only a few hours, but scientists expressed hope that the panels could
    generate electricity once the angle of the sun changes over the coming weeks.

    The SLIM’s (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) attempt isn’t Japan’s first:
    In November 2022, a lander called OMOTENASHI, operating as part of NASA’s Artemis
    I mission, made a landing attempt but did not meet its destination.'
