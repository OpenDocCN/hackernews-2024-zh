    dioxide and other environmentally harmful fossil fumes. Propane made from fossil
    fuels emits less carbon than coal or diesel, but more than natural gas when burned
    as fuel, [according to the US Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php).
