The default **US** shipping option is USPS Media Mail (6-8 business days).

**Big Babies** Books are not yet stocked in the Netherlands or the UK, so orders that include the Big Babies books ship internationally.

**UK** orders, that only include CE for Babies, ship from a fulfillment center in the UK and generally take 2-3 business days.

**NL, DE, and BE** orders, that only include CE for Babies, ship from the Netherlands and generally take 3-4 business days.

For **all other countries OR orders that include BIG Babies,** you can expect it to take anywhere from 1-6 weeks. Generally EU countries are closer to 2 weeks (and ship under the IOSS scheme, so you shouldn't have to pay any extra taxes or fees). Australia is usually about two weeks. While Norway and Sweden seem to usually take at least 6 weeks.
