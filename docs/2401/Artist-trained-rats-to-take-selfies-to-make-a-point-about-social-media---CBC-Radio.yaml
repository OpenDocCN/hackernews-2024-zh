    point the lens at humanity.

    for sweet treats. But over time, he says, they started doing it purely for the pleasure.

    the likes, but eventually just to trigger a flood of feel-good chemicals in our
    brains.

    *As It Happens* host Nil Köksal. "How we take images and why we take images, and
    why we interact with different devices, like phones, mainly, and apps."'

    Lignier acquired two male rats from a pet store, which he named Augustin and Arthur

    scientist B.F. Skinner to conduct learning experiments on rats.
  prefs: []

- en: In the original Skinner box experiments, rats would push a lever to dispense
    food pellets. In Lignier's box, when Arthur and Augustin pushed the lever, a camera
    would snap their picture and display it on a screen in front of them.

    selfies with sweets.

    "And they start to play more and more with it."'

    experiment's parameters. Sometimes taking a picture would yield a piece of sugar,
    and sometimes would not.

    After awhile, he says they largely stopped bothering to eat the sugar, even when
    it came out.

- en: Lignier says the installation draws a connection between how the rats use the
    photo box and how humans use social media. At first, he says, humans are incentivized
    by measurable rewards — namely likes or other engagements on posts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Many behavioural experts and researchers have said that what really keeps people
    scrolling and posting is dopamine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dopamine is a chemical produced in the brain when we do something pleasurable,
    like eating, exercising and having sex. It motivates us to continue that pleasurable
    behaviour, which is why it's also connected with addiction.

    a "modern-day hypodermic needle."'
