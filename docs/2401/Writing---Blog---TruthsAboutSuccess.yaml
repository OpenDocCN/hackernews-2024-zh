  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of the time when it comes down to doing something, people convince themselves
    away from doing it on counts of risk, on counts of time, on counts of effort and
    difficulty. While all these points hold weight, they are typically massively overestimated
    and overblown.

- en: As the most basic example of this, in an 8 hour day of work, people tend to
    only do 1-2 hours of "real" work, but often this "real" work isn't effective or
    successful work because it's terribly mismanaged in large corporations.

- en: There is a common element about programmers... they start projects and do not
    finish them. The same is said of Game Developers, Artists, Musicians etc. While
    there's something to be said of starting a project for study, exercise or improvement
    of your skills... most people simply do not finish their projects.

- en: Sturgeon's law says 90% of everything is crap. Personally, my standards of quality
    are much higher so I'd be much more aggressive about this, and say 95% of everything
    is crap. As a result of this, you will also find success if you produce something
    of quality.

- en: Most people don't know how to market themselves. Admittedly, I am the same so
    I cannot offer advice on how to market well- but I observe this fact, and this
    hurts a further 90% of projects.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Pareto principle is the 80/20 rule. As a result, one can observe that 80%
    of the work is done for 20% of the effort. While this doesn't always hold, as
    a general point it holds. This also interacts interestingly with "value-action"
    gap, where announcing your plans and intentions tends to hurt your efforts on
    them as you get "social dopamine" from this. As a result of the final 20% of the
    work requiring 80% of the effort to reach that very high bar of quality... if
    you're running for that dopamine, you will suffer with regards to Truth 2.

    and it will succeed".'

    iterative, each success rebounds with further bigger successes. Similarly each
    failure rebounds with bigger failures.

    you can multiply these out to find out how many people will typically be successful.
    0.05 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.005% of the population. As a fraction, that is 1/20000.

    healthy dollop of creativity, and creativity is already one of those qualities
    that is typically doomed from the outset as nature's offshoot mutation in individual
    strategy that typically face-plants and fails.

    world and the geographic history of the world to see how this relates to the "great"
    people of history. There is also probably a cultural coefficient that worsens
    or improves certain nations. America for example, with its liberties and capitalist
    reward in line with the Matthew effect provides good reward to the good people.

    but most living creatures are leeches in terms of how they acquire resources to
    live, so it's natural that it's a strategy for living for people.
