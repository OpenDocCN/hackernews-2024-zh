- en: I recently learned how to generate text using a simple [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).
    The generated text is readable but is also complete nonsense; as prose it’s not
    worth much, but for predicting the next word like your phone keyboard’s suggestions,
    it’s surprisingly useful.

- en: I learned about this algorithm in chapter 3 of Kernighan and Pike’s book [*The
    Practice of Programming*](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/), where
    they implement such a generator in various programming languages to discuss program
    design and data structures.

    list of the possible words that come after the word pair.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’ve built that data structure, you can generate as much or as little
    output as you want. Start with any pair of words that occurs in the input, and
    then randomly pick one of the possible third words. Then move along, so the second
    word in the pair is the word you just generated, randomly pick another word, and
    so on.

    tends to reproduce the input text verbatim. For English text, using two words

    “bear”, or “covet” as the next word. Because “covet” appears twice in the list

    This keeps the word-splitting simpler, but it also means the generated output

    actually occurred in the input. It’s quite a neat trick!

    similar design choices are hiding in existing programs, waiting to be simplified?
