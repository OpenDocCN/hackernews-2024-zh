- en: Hertz initially [ordered 100,000 cars from Tesla](https://www.thedrive.com/news/42862/hertz-just-ordered-100000-teslas-in-supposed-4-2b-deal),
    but has since pushed back its EV adoption for a multitude of reasons. The company
    blamed high repair costs and recent price cuts on new Teslas for the decision
    in an earnings call reported by [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html).
    It's possible that the arrival of [the 2024 Model 3's "Highland" facelift](https://www.thedrive.com/news/2024-tesla-model-3-with-new-face-and-interior-finally-arrives-in-us)
    may also have pushed Hertz to liquidate. In fact, Hertz is already offloading
    excess Teslas, sometimes for less than half what they cost new.

  zh: 赫兹最初从特斯拉[订购了10万辆汽车](https://www.thedrive.com/news/42862/hertz-just-ordered-100000-teslas-in-supposed-4-2b-deal)，但因为多种原因推迟了其电动汽车的采用。该公司在由[*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html)报道的一次盈利电话中，将高昂的维修费用和新特斯拉的最新价格下调归咎于这一决定。赫兹汽车的[2024款Model
    3的“Highland”改款](https://www.thedrive.com/news/2024-tesla-model-3-with-new-face-and-interior-finally-arrives-in-us)的到来也可能促使赫兹汽车进行清算。事实上，赫兹已经开始清理多余的特斯拉，有时价格不到原价的一半。

    portal, which have been listed for as low as $17,800 according to a screenshot
    published on [*Electrek*](https://electrek.co/2024/01/10/tesla-model-3-hertz-cheap-used-rental/).
    Accounting for [the $4,000 federal tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit)
    available for used EVs, that takes the net cost down to $13,800\. The cheapest
    cars depicted have already sold, so the lowest we found at time of publication
    was $20,500\. Still, that's just $16,500 accounting for the tax credit.

- en: No matter how you slice it, that's a strong value proposition for EV buyers.
    Sure, they're former rentals, meaning they'll have been mistreated by everyone
    who has touched them. And because they're Teslas, their interiors are Tupperware,
    repairs are expensive, and driving one will make your fellow motorists think you're
    into The Joe Rogan Experience and dubious supplements.

  zh: 不管怎么说，对于电动汽车买家来说，这都是一个强有力的价值主张。当然，它们是之前的租赁车，意味着它们被所有接触过它们的人都对待过。而且因为它们是特斯拉，它们的内饰就像塑料盒子，维修费用昂贵，开一辆会让你的同行司机认为你喜欢《乔·罗根体验》和可疑的补品。
- en: Still, from what we've seen of [Teslas in commercial use](https://www.thedrive.com/news/43788/this-932000-mile-tesla-model-s-is-still-hanging-in-there),
    even constant fast-charging won't ruin a battery until you're nearing 200,000
    miles. Your regular user will likely get a much longer lifespan out of theirs,
    and won't have to worry about an imminent [$16,000 replacement](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38915/it-costs-nearly-16000-to-replace-a-tesla-model-3-battery-pack).
    Considering the range, the price, and the access to the Supercharger network,
    it's hard not to see these Hertz Teslas as solid buys for those ready for an EV.

  zh: 尽管我们已经从[商用特斯拉](https://www.thedrive.com/news/43788/this-932000-mile-tesla-model-s-is-still-hanging-in-there)中看到了一些情况，即使是持续快速充电，也不会损坏电池，直到你接近20万英里。普通用户的电池寿命可能会更长，而且不必担心即将到来的[$16,000更换](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/38915/it-costs-nearly-16000-to-replace-a-tesla-model-3-battery-pack)。考虑到续航里程、价格和超级充电站网络的使用权，对于已准备好购买电动汽车的人来说，很难不把这些赫兹特斯拉看作是不错的选择。
