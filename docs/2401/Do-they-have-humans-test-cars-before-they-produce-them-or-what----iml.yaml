- en: Living in the city, I don’t own a car. But I rent one quite a lot if I want
    to go somewhere for a weekend or do odds and ends.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result is I’ve driven a fair number of cars over the past two years. Probably
    close to 70 or so. As a side effect, I have a lot of comparison points of features
    I like, feel indifferent about, and hate with a passion of 1,000 suns.
  prefs: []

- en: The overarching lesson I’ve learned from these rentals is just how user hostile
    these cars have become and how it’s become a displeasure to operate a lot of them.
    I've documented some of them here. Forgive any foul language.

    the way, because (and maybe I have weak fingers or something) it's more difficult
    to open it with an open hand than a closed hand.

    a "open trunk" button, so I needed to find the latch to open the trunk. I looked
    for the latch in the usual places: the center. I found nothing. After that, I
    was feeling around the car for something like a latch (still in the center). If
    you were an onlooker, it might have looked as though I was having a love affair
    with this car.'

    85,000 views. Even if it wasn''t all unique people, that means people had to REWATCH

    bite. Easy. Let me just shift it into par — OH SHIT IT'S IN REVERSE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polestar, if you aren't familiar, is an electric car. Overall, it's not bad,
    but it's shifter is a problem for someone like me that doesn't use the car a lot.
    It's an actual danger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Instead of the shifter moving in a singular direction across gears: P -> R
    -> N -> D, it uses a button for park (fine, I''ve used that before), and (more
    crucially) centers the shifter in a quasi-neutral position. You can shift up or
    down to get into neutral. Although, there isn''t really any up and down, the shifter
    remains stationary and only takes the direction of the shift. So, there''s no
    indication of where it is aside from an extremely small indicator on the dashboard
    showing the gear.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, if you aren''t familiar with the shifter (like me), you go to park and
    think it might operate like a regular shifter. You shift it all the way forward
    thinking that might get you into park, but surprise: you''re in reverse and about
    to hit little ol'' Bertha with her Dunkin'' Donuts.'

    that decided to brake when I lifted my foot off the gas. I tried looking through

    or if it was even a setting.

    that's enough to give you the spot. But if I have a car that is being a little
    wimp, and aggressively braking on me when I KNOW I got the room, it is costing
    me a coveted spot that will be snatched up within 10 seconds by the next car.
