    got this idea! I'm not talking about only Hacker News, but a combination of Hacker
    News, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com).
    Do you need it? I don't know. Maybe this idea is nothing but rubbish. However,
    I have a business plan too. So let's get into the idea.

    the website from any technology. I prefer something like [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
    or [React](https://react.dev). Anyway, I'm not a front-end developer, so any front-end
    developer can suggest the technology.
  prefs: []

- en: The mobile application is just a front-end as well as the website. We can build
    it using any technology that a front-end developer suggests. I haven't framed
    into any technologies for both the website and mobile application yet. This is
    just a high-level explanation of the system that I'm talking about.
  prefs: []

- en: From the client-side, users are allowed to register into the system, log in
    to their accounts, and post anything like in Reddit. So they can post articles
    or links. When saying articles, I'm not talking about [microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging)
    but real [blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog). This is where Reddit-ness
    comes into play. In Hacker News, we can't do blogging. I have a reason to post
    articles in this system. Let's talk about that later.
  prefs: []

- en: The client, website, or mobile application is joined to the API server through
    a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). This is my idea. If you have
    other alternatives, suggestions are always welcome. Whatever technology we use
    here, anyone should have the freedom to create clients on their own. So the API
    server should be publicly accessible. This means, as a decentralized system, anyone
    should be able to create their own client for any instance. This should be an
    open network. That's what was in my mind. If the instance owner needs to make
    their instance private, they should host it in a private network, where outsiders
    don't have access.

    [Python](https://www.python.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [PHP](https://www.php.net),
    and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) in my mind. Since this is the engine of
    this system, the API must be able to process lots of data. So, not like in the
    front-end, the technology will be crucial here. We should use maintainable, solid
    technology for this.

- en: All the user's data will be stored in the database. We can use separate storages,
    something like an [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) bucket, for storing files. I
    don't have any specific technology to use as the database. We can use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org),
    [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org), or even a no-SQL database like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
    This is open to suggestions as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need a cache to optimize the user experience as well as the federation across
    the instances. When an outer instance sends a request to this system, the cache
    server will serve the data. The internal database is not open to the outer instances.
    Maybe we can use something like [Redis](https://redis.io) for this. I don't know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The API server is connected to the courier server via something like a REST
    API. And again, the mentioned technology is just an example. We can use whatever
    we like.
  prefs: []

- en: The courier server
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use the courier server to do the federation among the instances. Mastodon
    uses the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) protocol to do this.
    We also can use that or we can just use a REST API with a standardized structure.
    As always, I'm open to any suggestion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The courier server is a two-way server, which means it sends requests and receives
    requests at the same time. When an external instance requests data from this instance,
    the request is sent from the courier server of the external instance. That request
    was received by the courier server of this instance. After that, the internal
    requests made within the internal courier server, internal API server, cache,
    and database. After that, the response will be sent to the external courier server.
    Only courier servers communicate with each other. Endpoints, which are not available
    for the front-end, will be only opened to the internal courier server. External
    courier servers can't communicate directly with other API servers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We might need to use some kind of authentication system across the internal
    API server and internal courier server. Since courier servers are externally accessible
    from other courier servers, we also might need to add an authentication layer
    for courier servers. Courier servers should not be publicly accessible for anyone
    but other courier servers. I'm still working on what kind of authentication system
    we should implement for this. Suggestions are always welcome.

    [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention), and other stuff. We can do things
    like Webmention in this system. Each instance will act like an independent blog.
    Just like Mastodon, but for blogging.
