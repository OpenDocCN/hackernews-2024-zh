At Tillitis, we’re all about crafting Open Source cybersecurity products, with transparency as our core value. As a startup, we’re hands-on and dive into whatever it takes, even beyond our usual expertise. We’re problem solvers, with a focus on product development (HW/FW/SW) and solving customer security needs.

We wear many hats: handling web shop orders, shipping products, writing documentation (dev handbook, website, internal docs), planning releases, and fostering a great office atmosphere.

We are flexible, but do have a nice office that we like to use. If this clicks with you, reach out!
