- en: The police regularly force Netherlands residents to give up footage recorded
    by their doorbell cameras for crime investigations. Communication with the public
    always focuses on voluntary cooperation between the police and citizens, but in
    practice, the police almost always use coercion, [BNR](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/juridisch/10538281/deurbelcamera-maakt-burgers-tot-doelwit-dwangmiddelen-politie)
    reports after its own investigation. “The rise of the smart doorbell has made
    citizens the target of coercive measures on a large scale,” the broadcaster concluded.

- en: A resident of the Randje Ondiep neighborhood in Utrecht got two police officers
    on her doorstep after an explosion nearby. The cops spotted her smart doorbell
    from the street. “If you could provide images, that would be very nice,” they
    told her. She gave them her email address and, within a few hours, received a
    demand email containing threatening legal language. She had to submit images within
    seven days. Refusing is a punishable offense. “I wasn’t even sure I had images,
    so I’m worried about what will happen if I can’t provide any,” she told BNR.

- en: Inquiries by BNR at ten regional police forces, the National Police, and the
    Public Prosecution Service (OM) showed that requisitioning footage from owners
    of doorbell cameras is now standard practice. After a crime, police officers walk
    the neighborhood and check for cameras door to door. Refusing a demand for footage
    is a punishable offense that can lead to a fine or a prison sentence of up to
    three months. The OM told BNR that it has “not yet happened” that the owner of
    a doorbell camera refused to comply with a demand.

- en: The implication is that anyone with a doorbell camera can become a target of
    such a demand, risking prison or a fine if they refuse. “The fact that the police
    can demand images fits in with a broader trend,” Vincent Böhre, lawyer and director
    of the Privacy First Foundation, told the broadcaster. “Namely, that citizens
    and companies increasingly seem to be becoming an extension of the police and
    judiciary.” Böhre worries about “a development towards a kind of police state.”

    in criminal files as a result of the footage they provide. Suspects have the right
    to see all evidence against them, including the demand for footage, which shows
    the name and address of the doorbell camera’s owner. Such information can only
    be blocked out under exceptional circumstances, police spokesperson Luna van Heerwaarden
    said. For example, when “there have already been unpleasant experiences with the
    perpetrator.”

- en: According to BNR, a search through the online register of legal cases on Rechtspraak.nl
    showed that doorbell camera owners’ names and addresses do end up in criminal
    files. For example, footage from a doorbell camera was used as evidence in the
    fatal stabbing of a woman in Hengelo on 24 December 2019\. The camera owner’s
    name and address are included in the verdict.
