***Updated January 25**: VMware has now deleted the KB ("Knowledge Base") advisory that we sourced the below from. It has clarified its intentions a in fresh KB.* [*Our updated article is here*](https://www.thestack.technology/vmware-clarifies-portfolio-rationalisation-after-deleting-a-post-that-shocked-customers/)*.*
