    team through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5V7qcs3X88) or at [support@kagi.com](mailto:support@kagi.com).
    We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration
    process.

- en: To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT
    will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state)
    and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT
    obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT
    that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb
    this on behalf of our customers.
