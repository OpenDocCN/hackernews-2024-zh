    but in an important way, they are just like every other method of managing weight:
    They work only to a point for weight loss. The pounds melt off quickly at first
    and then gradually and then not at all. You can’t lose any more no matter what
    you do. You’ve hit the weight-loss plateau.'

- en: It happens with dieting. It happens with bariatric surgery. And it happens now
    with both semaglutide (better known as Ozempic or Wegovy, depending on whether
    it’s prescribed for diabetes or weight loss) and tirzepatide (better known as
    Mounjaro or Zepbound). Weight loss triggers a set of powerful physiological changes
    in the body, which evolved over millions of years to keep us alive through periods
    of food scarcity. “Everybody plateaus,” says Jamy Ard, an obesity doctor at Wake
    Forest University. Exactly when varies quite a bit from person to person, but
    it happens after losing a certain percentage of body weight—meaning some people
    might plateau while still meeting the criteria for obesity.

    usually more than a year into starting the drug. For Zepbound, it’s about [20
    percent](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038). These numbers are
    higher than is sustainable through diet and exercise alone, but they also do not
    reach the [30 percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112115/)
    achievable via the [gold standard of bariatric surgery](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/weight-loss-surgeons-arent-worried-about-ozempic/673853/).

    is not permanently fixed. Recent advances in understanding the gut hormones that
    these drugs are designed to mimic hint at a possibility of even more powerful
    weight-loss drugs. Scientists are now testing ways to push the plateau down further;
    a drug could one day be even more effective than bariatric surgery.

    says Jonathan Campbell, who studies gut hormones at Duke. In studies, even 5 to
    15 percent weight loss can [substantially reverse](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12406040/)
    high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol. Yet a patient who

    a joint replacement that requires a BMI below 40, [flawed as BMI](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/11/bmi-health-obesity-drugs/676171/)
    may be. Or they may simply want to look thinner. The explosion of weight-loss
    drugs has reopened thorny questions about how they should be used, but nevertheless,
    pharmaceutical companies are racing ahead to develop more and more powerful ones.'

    against it. “Your brain doesn’t know you’re trying to lose weight on purpose,”
    Ard says. And once it notices, “it thinks that something is wrong.” So your body
    tries very, very hard to compensate.

- en: First of all, you become hungrier, obviously. And not just because you want
    to eat as much as you did before; you actually want to eat more than you did prior
    to losing weight. “With every one kilogram you lose, your appetite goes up above
    baseline by 90 or so calories per day,” says Kevin Hall, who studies metabolism
    at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. At the
    same time, your body looks for ways to conserve energy. Your muscles work more
    efficiently, for example, Ard says, so walking that normally burned 100 calories
    might now burn only 90\. By making you want to eat more and burning fewer calories,
    your body is eventually able to slow weight loss down to zero. Here is your plateau.
    This is, all told, a remarkably elegant and robust system, if what you wanted
    to do is to maintain your weight.

    frustrating. The same diet, the same exercise routine, the drug on which you were
    just losing weight will seem to have stopped working—but they haven’t. (If they
    did actually stop working, you would be regaining weight.) But your body is now
    fighting so hard against the weight loss that it requires a persistent effort
    just to keep the weight off, Hall says. Should you ease up, the weight will come
    right back, as seen in yo-yo dieting or weight regain after stopping Wegovy or
    Zepbound.

    Doctors might recommend, for example, bariatric surgery *and* a weight-loss drug.
    But in the future, novel drugs might be able to pharmacologically up the intensity.
    The progression from Wegovy to the more effective Zepbound has in fact already
    brought us one step closer.

- en: Wegovy and Zepbound both belong to a class of drugs that mimic a gut hormone
    called GLP-1\. Both of these drugs bind GLP-1 receptors in the brain, which seems
    to reduce hunger. Zepbound goes a step further, though. It can also bind receptors
    for a second gut hormone, called GIP. Years ago, researchers noticed that [bariatric
    surgery changes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978115002454?via%3Dihub)
    the balance of gut hormones in the body, including GLP-1 and GIP. This—and not
    just the physical shrinking of the stomach—is now understood to be a key driver
    of weight loss, to the point that bariatric surgery is sometimes called “metabolic
    surgery.” These observations inspired research into drugs that target not just
    GLP-1 but also GIP and other hormones. Essentially, they’re performing metabolic
    surgery with a drug rather than a scalpel.

- en: 'Exactly why Zepbound outperforms Wegovy is still unclear. One obvious hypothesis
    is that it mimics a second gut hormone; the more hormonal pathways it can influence,
    perhaps, the more body parts it affects and the more weight loss it triggers.
    And a recent clinical trial of [retatrutide](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972),
    a further modified derivative of Zepbound that mimics a third hormone called glucagon,
    demonstrated even greater weight loss: 24 percent at the highest dose.'

- en: 'A second hypothesis suggests that the difference between Wegovy and Zepbound
    still goes back to GLP-1\. Although both drugs bind that receptor, they tickle
    it slightly differently, setting off slightly different chain reactions. Wegovy
    seems to also activate some cellular machinery that acts as a brake, possibly
    limiting its efficacy. This suggests another strategy for fine-tuning gut-hormone
    drugs: Companies have so far focused on trying to design one drug that binds to
    multiple hormone receptors, like a master key that can open three different locks.
    This was a practical choice, Campbell says, because trying to study three separate
    new drugs in clinical trials would be a logistical “nightmare.” But the optimal
    combination for weight loss might actually require individual keys that can jigger
    individual receptors in just the right way—that is, a double or triple combination
    of drugs.'

- en: It may also eventually be possible to keep increasing the dosage of GLP-1 drugs
    to push the weight-loss plateau down. Right now, the dose is limited by what people
    are willing to tolerate. The drugs can cause severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea,
    so they have to be ramped up slowly over many weeks to induce tolerance and minimize
    side effects. But Novo Nordisk is trialing the drug in Wegovy at [up to 16 milligrams](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05486065)
    a week, more than six times the current maximum dose. Tinkering with other gut-hormone
    pathways could also help with side effects. GIP receptors, for example, are found
    in neurons whose activation might suppress nausea, which may in part be why Zepbound
    seems to have slightly milder side effects.

- en: Zepbound is likely the first of many leveling-ups from single-action GLP-1 drugs.
    Even as the science advances, no safe method of losing weight is meant to eliminate
    the weight-loss plateau—and indeed, you wouldn’t want to keep losing weight indefinitely.
    But lose more weight? Pharmaceutical companies are betting on a market for that.
    With obesity drugs projected to become a [$100 billion industry](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/obesity-drugs)
    by 2030, they are eager for a slice of that massive pie. “The dollar signs are
    so big now,” Campbell says. Zepbound is the newest weight-loss drug on the block,
    but it too may eventually be [old news](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-weight-loss-drug-development-access/673627/).
