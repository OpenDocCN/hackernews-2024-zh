    but in an important way, they are just like every other method of managing weight:
    They work only to a point for weight loss. The pounds melt off quickly at first
    and then gradually and then not at all. You can’t lose any more no matter what
    you do. You’ve hit the weight-loss plateau.'

  zh: 最新的减肥药被公认为肥胖的游戏规则改变者，但在一个重要的方面，它们与管理体重的每一种方法都是一样的：它们仅在减肥方面起作用。起初，体重迅速减轻，然后逐渐减慢，最终停止减轻。无论你做什么，你都不能再减轻了。你已经达到了减肥的平台期。
- en: It happens with dieting. It happens with bariatric surgery. And it happens now
    with both semaglutide (better known as Ozempic or Wegovy, depending on whether
    it’s prescribed for diabetes or weight loss) and tirzepatide (better known as
    Mounjaro or Zepbound). Weight loss triggers a set of powerful physiological changes
    in the body, which evolved over millions of years to keep us alive through periods
    of food scarcity. “Everybody plateaus,” says Jamy Ard, an obesity doctor at Wake
    Forest University. Exactly when varies quite a bit from person to person, but
    it happens after losing a certain percentage of body weight—meaning some people
    might plateau while still meeting the criteria for obesity.

    “每个人都会出现平台期，” 威克森林大学肥胖医生詹姆·阿德说。确切的时间因人而异，但在失去一定比例的体重后会发生—这意味着有些人可能在仍符合肥胖标准时就会出现平台期。

    usually more than a year into starting the drug. For Zepbound, it’s about [20
    percent](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038). These numbers are
    higher than is sustainable through diet and exercise alone, but they also do not

    against it. “Your brain doesn’t know you’re trying to lose weight on purpose,”
    Ard says. And once it notices, “it thinks that something is wrong.” So your body
    tries very, very hard to compensate.

- en: First of all, you become hungrier, obviously. And not just because you want
    to eat as much as you did before; you actually want to eat more than you did prior
    to losing weight. “With every one kilogram you lose, your appetite goes up above
    baseline by 90 or so calories per day,” says Kevin Hall, who studies metabolism
    at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. At the
    same time, your body looks for ways to conserve energy. Your muscles work more
    efficiently, for example, Ard says, so walking that normally burned 100 calories
    might now burn only 90\. By making you want to eat more and burning fewer calories,
    your body is eventually able to slow weight loss down to zero. Here is your plateau.
    This is, all told, a remarkably elegant and robust system, if what you wanted
    to do is to maintain your weight.

    frustrating. The same diet, the same exercise routine, the drug on which you were
    just losing weight will seem to have stopped working—but they haven’t. (If they
    did actually stop working, you would be regaining weight.) But your body is now
    fighting so hard against the weight loss that it requires a persistent effort
    just to keep the weight off, Hall says. Should you ease up, the weight will come
    right back, as seen in yo-yo dieting or weight regain after stopping Wegovy or
    Zepbound.

    Doctors might recommend, for example, bariatric surgery *and* a weight-loss drug.
    But in the future, novel drugs might be able to pharmacologically up the intensity.
    The progression from Wegovy to the more effective Zepbound has in fact already

- en: Wegovy and Zepbound both belong to a class of drugs that mimic a gut hormone
    called GLP-1\. Both of these drugs bind GLP-1 receptors in the brain, which seems
    to reduce hunger. Zepbound goes a step further, though. It can also bind receptors
    for a second gut hormone, called GIP. Years ago, researchers noticed that [bariatric
    surgery changes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196978115002454?via%3Dihub)
    the balance of gut hormones in the body, including GLP-1 and GIP. This—and not
    just the physical shrinking of the stomach—is now understood to be a key driver
    of weight loss, to the point that bariatric surgery is sometimes called “metabolic
    surgery.” These observations inspired research into drugs that target not just
    GLP-1 but also GIP and other hormones. Essentially, they’re performing metabolic
    surgery with a drug rather than a scalpel.

  zh: Wegovy和Zepbound都属于一类模仿肠激素GLP-1的药物。这两种药物都结合了脑中的GLP-1受体，这似乎减少了饥饿感。但是，Zepbound更进一步。它还可以结合第二种肠激素GIP的受体。多年前，研究人员注意到，减肥手术改变了体内肠激素的平衡，包括GLP-1和GIP。现在已经明白，这——而不仅仅是胃的物理缩小——是体重减轻的一个关键推动因素，以至于减肥手术有时被称为“代谢手术”。这些观察启发了针对不仅仅是GLP-1而且还包括GIP和其他激素的药物的研究。基本上，他们正在用药物而不是手术刀进行代谢手术。

- en: 'Exactly why Zepbound outperforms Wegovy is still unclear. One obvious hypothesis
    is that it mimics a second gut hormone; the more hormonal pathways it can influence,
    perhaps, the more body parts it affects and the more weight loss it triggers.
    And a recent clinical trial of [retatrutide](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2301972),
    a further modified derivative of Zepbound that mimics a third hormone called glucagon,
    demonstrated even greater weight loss: 24 percent at the highest dose.'

  zh: 为什么Zepbound的表现优于Wegovy仍然不清楚。一个明显的假设是它模仿了第二种肠激素；它能影响的激素途径越多，或许它影响的身体部位越多，引发的减肥效果越大。最近对retatrutide的一项临床试验，它是Zepbound的进一步改良衍生物，模仿了第三种称为胰高血糖素的激素，表现出了更大的减肥效果：在最高剂量下为24％。
- en: 'A second hypothesis suggests that the difference between Wegovy and Zepbound
    still goes back to GLP-1\. Although both drugs bind that receptor, they tickle
    it slightly differently, setting off slightly different chain reactions. Wegovy
    seems to also activate some cellular machinery that acts as a brake, possibly
    limiting its efficacy. This suggests another strategy for fine-tuning gut-hormone
    drugs: Companies have so far focused on trying to design one drug that binds to
    multiple hormone receptors, like a master key that can open three different locks.
    This was a practical choice, Campbell says, because trying to study three separate
    new drugs in clinical trials would be a logistical “nightmare.” But the optimal
    combination for weight loss might actually require individual keys that can jigger
    individual receptors in just the right way—that is, a double or triple combination
    of drugs.'

  zh: 一种第二假设认为Wegovy和Zepbound之间的差异仍然归结于GLP-1。虽然这两种药物都与该受体结合，但它们稍微不同地刺激它，引发了稍微不同的链式反应。Wegovy似乎还激活了一些作为刹车的细胞机制，可能限制了其功效。这提出了另一种微调肠激素药物的策略：迄今为止，公司一直致力于设计一种药物，该药物结合了多种激素受体，就像一把可以打开三把不同锁的万能钥匙。这是一个实际的选择，Campbell说，因为在临床试验中尝试研究三种不同的新药物将是一个后勤“噩梦”。但是减肥的最佳组合实际上可能需要可以以恰当的方式操作单个受体的单个钥匙，即药物的双重或三重组合。
- en: It may also eventually be possible to keep increasing the dosage of GLP-1 drugs
    to push the weight-loss plateau down. Right now, the dose is limited by what people
    are willing to tolerate. The drugs can cause severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea,
    so they have to be ramped up slowly over many weeks to induce tolerance and minimize
    side effects. But Novo Nordisk is trialing the drug in Wegovy at [up to 16 milligrams](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05486065)
    a week, more than six times the current maximum dose. Tinkering with other gut-hormone
    pathways could also help with side effects. GIP receptors, for example, are found
    in neurons whose activation might suppress nausea, which may in part be why Zepbound
    seems to have slightly milder side effects.

  zh: 也许最终可以继续增加 GLP-1 药物的剂量来降低减肥停滞期。目前，剂量受到人们愿意耐受的限制。这些药物可能会导致严重的恶心、呕吐和腹泻，因此必须在多个星期内缓慢增加剂量，以诱导耐受性并最小化副作用。但诺和诺德正在以[最高每周达到16毫克](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05486065)的剂量在
    Wegovy 中进行试验，是当前最大剂量的六倍多。对其他肠激素通路进行调节也可能有助于减少副作用。例如，GIP 受体存在于激活可能抑制恶心的神经元中，这也可能是
    Zepbound 似乎副作用稍轻的部分原因。
- en: Zepbound is likely the first of many leveling-ups from single-action GLP-1 drugs.
    Even as the science advances, no safe method of losing weight is meant to eliminate

    But lose more weight? Pharmaceutical companies are betting on a market for that.
    With obesity drugs projected to become a [$100 billion industry](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/obesity-drugs)
    by 2030, they are eager for a slice of that massive pie. “The dollar signs are
