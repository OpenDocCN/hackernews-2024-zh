    in 2022\. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn’t use the company’s “free”
    services — “[such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or
    those who earn farm income](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/administrative-law-judge-issues-initial-decision-ftcs-case-against-intuit-inc).”
    TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers,according to
    the FTC.

    the FTC — ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the
    last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where
    the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in
    the same case,” an an Intuit spokesperson said.

    qualify for the free service, somewhere close to the “free” claim advertised,
