  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A pie chart is a circular diagram that represents numerical percentages. The
    circle is divided into slices, with the size of each slice proportional to the
    category it represents. It is named because it resembles a sliced pie and can
    be “served” in many different ways.

    the last election, with Labor on 55% and the the Coalition on 45%. The two near
    semi-circles show the relatively tight race – this is a useful example of a pie
    chart.
