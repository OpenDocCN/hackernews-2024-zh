- en: The Natrium plant will use liquid sodium as a cooling agent instead of water.
    Sodium has several safety advantages over water. A higher boiling point means

    a battery. That means the plant can temporarily boost its capacity from the planned
    345 megawatts to 500 megawatts. The boost would last about five hours.
