    out what a lot of businesses interested in the small southwestern town in Wyoming
    are discovering of late — the town’s available real estate is filling up fast.

    create all that economic heat in the first place by announcing it had selected
    the frontier coal town for the first of its novel nuclear plants.

    $4 billion, in 2021\. That touched off something of an economic firestorm for
    the community of about 2,500 people.

    lots of inquiries from prospective developers, and he’s seeing Main Street, as
    well as the city’s downtown triangle of streets that serves as a nexus for businesses,
    fill up with hopeful new businesses.

    be a game-changer for nuclear power.
  prefs: []

- en: The Natrium plant will use liquid sodium as a cooling agent instead of water.
    Sodium has several safety advantages over water. A higher boiling point means
    it can soak up more heat than water with less risk of explosion.

    that proved a weakness in the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown, where a tsunami killed
    the diesel generators running its backup cooling system.

- en: The molten salt can even hold onto that heat energy for a while, a little like
    a battery. That means the plant can temporarily boost its capacity from the planned
    345 megawatts to 500 megawatts. The boost would last about five hours.

    Kemmerer is adding over 1,000 workers at once, he added.

    of the nuclear plant for TerraPower alone — a significant challenge.

    workers. The city prefers to avoid man camps if it can, which have gotten a bad
    reputation in other boom towns.

    for developers to build out housing projects — two of which are already on drawing
    boards.

    projects in Kemmerer, which Muir believes will, between them, take care of any
    housing issues the city might have faced.

    new units over three phases. The first phase includes 144 units, 88 of which will
    be townhomes, and the rest single-family residential.

    and 197 multi-family units.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that workers will often go in together on housing with three to five people
    in one dwelling, and the fact that Kemmerer already has about 651 housing units
    between hotels, motels, single- and multi-family dwellings, Muir believes these
    two developments will help top off the town’s housing needs, especially given
    that many existing landowners are also taking concurrent steps to help house workers.

    hookups there, all of which can later be used to house tourists.

    a nearby coal mine to a completely new industry, one that would produce carbon-free
    ammonia and other products like fertilizer and skin care items from the coal.

    nuclear plant and test facility would add, but keep all of the coal mine jobs,
