- en: Imagine discovering a zero-click attack targeting Apple mobile devices of your
    colleagues and managing to capture all the stages of the attack. That’s exactly
    what happened to us! This led to the fixing of four zero-day vulnerabilities and
    discovering of a previously unknown and highly sophisticated spyware that had
    been around for years without anyone noticing. We call it Operation Triangulation.
    We've been teasing this story for almost six months, while thoroughly analyzing
    every stage of the attack. Now, for the first time, we're ready to tell you all
    about it. This is the story of the most sophisticated attack chain and spyware
    ever discovered by Kaspersky.
