    we can now add: Jean-Paul Sartre. FBI and State Depart­ment reports of the 1960s
    had drawn atten­tion to Sartre’s mem­ber­ship of the Fair Play for Cuba Com­mit­tee,
    of which Lee Har­vey Oswald was also a mem­ber. And—prophetically?—Sartre had
    “dis­missed the US as a head­less nation.” […] Could he, after all, have been
    the Sec­ond Shoot­er?'

    through­out this open­ing of his fas­ci­nat­ing chron­i­cle of the FBI’s sur­veil­lance
    of [Sartre](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/) and his one­time friend
    and edi­tor [Albert Camus](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/). But Martin’s
    inter­est in the mis­al­liance of Sartre and the Feds is very seri­ous. What he
    finds dur­ing his inves­ti­ga­tion of the FBI files on exis­ten­tial­ism is that
    “the [G‑men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_(slang)), ini­tial­ly so anti-philo­soph­i­cal,
    find them­selves reluc­tant­ly phi­los­o­phiz­ing. They become (in GK Chesterton’s
    phrase) *philo­soph­i­cal police­men*.”

    witch hunts, it seems that Sartre and Camus served as test cas­es for the sort
    of thing that fre­quent­ly plays out in over­heat­ed Con­gres­sion­al hear­ings
    and media denunciations—agents with fur­rowed brows and lit­tle philo­soph­i­cal
    train­ing des­per­ate­ly try­ing to work out whether such and such abstruse aca­d­e­m­ic
    is part of a grand con­spir­a­cy to under­mine truth, jus­tice, the Amer­i­can
    Way, etc.. Sartre appeared ear­ly on the anti-Com­mu­nist radar, though, iron­i­cal­ly,
    he did so as a plant of sorts, [brought over in 1945](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/us/when-sartre-and-camus-met-hoovers-g-men.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&)
    by the Office of War Infor­ma­tion as part of a group of jour­nal­ists the Unit­ed
    States’ gov­ern­ment hoped would put out good pro­pa­gan­da.

    you can hope to get out of the author of *Nau­sea* and *Being and Noth­ing­ness*.”
    It turned out, not much, but a year lat­er Hoover latched on to Sartre’s friend
    and edi­tor Albert Camus, whose name he and his agents spelled, var­i­ous­ly,
    as “Canus” or “Corus.” Where Sartre had breezed into the country—smitten by its
    lit­er­a­ture and music—Camus was held at immi­gra­tion on Hoover’s orders. He
    would spend a brief, depress­ing time and nev­er return.

- en: How we get from post-war sur­veil­lance of French exis­ten­tial­ist philoso­phers
    to Sartre and the grassy knoll is a long and com­pli­cat­ed tale, befit­ting the
    para­noid imag­in­ings of J. Edgar Hoover. He was, after all, the con­spir­a­cy
    the­o­rist *par excel­lence* and “he need­ed to know,” writes Mar­tin, “if Exis­ten­tial­ism
    and Absur­dism were some kind of front for Com­mu­nism. To him, every­thing was
    poten­tial­ly a cod­ed re-write of the Com­mu­nist Man­i­festo.” What Hoover feared
    from Sartre, how­ev­er, was that the lat­ter was him­self an influ­en­tial believ­er
    in a con­spir­a­cy, one that cast doubt on the FBI’s strong­ly-held belief that
    Oswald was the lone gun­man.

    Hoover’s agents were nev­er able to dis­cern the ide­o­log­i­cal pro­gram of the
    French. “I can’t work out,” wrote one in a note in Sartre’s file, “if he’s pro-Com­mu­nist
    or anti-Com­mu­nist.” The black-and-white, spy-vs-spy world of the FBI left lit­tle
    room for philo­soph­i­cal nuance and lit­er­ary ambi­gu­i­ty, after all. But they
    nev­er stopped watch­ing Sartre, con­vinced that “there must be some kind of con­spir­a­cy
    between com­mu­nists, blacks, poets and French philoso­phers.” As it turns out,
    there were several—political and aes­thet­ic con­spir­a­cies involv­ing such ter­ri­fy­ing
    fig­ures as Frantz Fanon and Aimé Césaire. These poets and close rela­tions of
    Sartre did, indeed, help foment rev­o­lu­tion in the Caribbean and elsewhere—but
    theirs are sto­ries for anoth­er day.
