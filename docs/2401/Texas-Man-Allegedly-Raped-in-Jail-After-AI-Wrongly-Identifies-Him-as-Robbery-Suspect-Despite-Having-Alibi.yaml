    men stole thousands of dollars from the store, according to a lawsuit. During
    the robbery, the men ordered two employees into a back room and told them to stay
    there so they could get away, court records say.

    their guy," the lawsuit said. The employee said he worked with Macy's loss prevention
    using artificial intelligence and facial recognition software to identify the
    suspect as the 61-year-old man, the lawsuit said.

    the man was one of the robbers, and police put out a warrant for his arrest, court
    records said. However, the man had an alibi at the time of the robbery. He was
    2,000 miles away in California, according to his lawyer.

    assaulted, according to the lawsuit. "He was followed into the bathroom by three
    violent criminals. He was beaten, forced on the ground, and brutally gang raped.
    After this violent attack, one of the criminals held a shank against his neck
    and told him that if he reported the rape to anyone, he would be murdered," the
    lawsuit said. After the attack, the man crawled into his bunk, faced the wall
    and prayed he wouldn't be attacked again, the lawsuit said.

- en: Facial recognition is an artificial intelligence technology that analyzes human
    faces and creates a biometric template, according to the lawsuit. Sunglass Hut
    collects customers' "biometric identifiers" and "biometric information" with face
    scanning technology at many of its locations, the court documents said.

    it uses facial-recognition software to identify people who allegedly steal from
    the Sunglass Hut," the lawsuit said. The court documents say the technology being
    used is not accurate in most cases and is what led to the wrongful arrest of the
    man, who is now seeking $10 million in damages from a jury trial.'
