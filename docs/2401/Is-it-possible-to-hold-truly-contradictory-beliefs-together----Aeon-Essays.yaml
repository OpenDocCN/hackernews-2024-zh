    dread. I’m overwhelmed by the sheer number of products, left with a sense that
    I should buy either all of them or none of them – somehow, it seems that there
    is no practicable way to select just one or two. A few years ago, I decided: enough.
    I formed the intention never to visit the mall again. From then on, it was to
    be only online ordering for me – never mind the number of returns I’d have to
    make when it turned out that I’d guessed wrong *again* about whether to order
    a sweater in a medium or a large.'

  zh: 我讨厌去商场。每次去商场，我都充满了存在主义的恐惧感。我被大量的商品淹没，感觉自己要么买下所有的商品，要么一个都不买 —— 但似乎没有实际的方法只选一个或两个商品。几年前，我下定决心：够了。我打算再也不去商场了。从那时起，我只会在线下订单
    —— 不管我在猜测是否应该订购中号还是大号时又会错了多少次，也不管我要做多少次退货。

    when it seemed like all my partner and I did on the weekends was attend weddings,
    the stream of invites had dried up somewhat, and I was excited to have a chance
    to leave our kid with the grandparents, drink one too many glasses of Prosecco,
    and hit the dancefloor when those first few bars of ‘Hey Ya!’ inevitably sounded.
    Thinking of that dancefloor, my mind turned to my lone pair of battered old dress
    shoes. The left shoe had a weird stain on top, subtle enough to be unapparent
    to a casual observer, but noticeable enough to bother me whenever I looked down.
    It was time for a new pair, and I formed the intention to buy some for the wedding.

    Ya!’响起时冲到舞池上。想到那个舞池，我的脑海里浮现出我那唯一的一双破旧的礼鞋。左鞋顶部有一个奇怪的污渍，足够微妙以至于一个随意的观察者看不出来，但足够显眼以至于每次我低头看时都让我感到烦恼。是时候换一双新鞋了，我打算为了婚礼买一双。

    many other kinds of incoherence. For example, it’s incoherent to have ‘cyclical’

    strawberry, but prefer strawberry to chocolate. And it’s incoherent to have beliefs
    that are straightforwardly logically inconsistent – say, to believe that great

    types: for example, between beliefs, preferences, intentions, or mixtures of more
    than one of these types. In all cases, though, it’s crucial that the defect is
    in the combination of states, not necessarily in any of them taken individually.
    There’s nothing wrong with preferring chocolate ice cream to vanilla, or preferring
    vanilla to strawberry, or preferring strawberry to chocolate; but there is something
    very strange about having all of these preferences together. Similarly, there
    might be nothing wrong either with intending to buy new shoes, or with intending
    not to visit the mall, or with believing that the only way to buy new shoes is
    to visit the mall; what’s defective is the combination of all three. Even when
    it comes to the inconsistent beliefs (that great cooks never overcook eggs, that

  zh: 正如这些例子所示，不连贯可以存在于各种类型的精神状态之间：例如，信念之间，偏好之间，意图之间，或者多种类型的混合状态之间。然而，在所有情况下，关键的是缺陷在于状态的组合，而不一定是它们中的任何一个单独地。更喜欢巧克力冰淇淋胜过香草，或者更喜欢香草胜过草莓，或者更喜欢草莓胜过巧克力，这些行为都没什么错；但是拥有所有这些偏好却是很奇怪的。同样，打算买新鞋或者不打算去商场或者相信唯一的买新鞋方法是去商场，这些都可能没有错；问题是这三者的组合是有瑕疵的。甚至在涉及不一致的信念时（伟大的厨师从不煮熟鸡蛋，你是一位伟大的厨师，但你煮熟了蛋），任何一个单独来看都*显然*不合理；再次强调，最明显有瑕疵的是这种组合。

    being *unreasonable*. Consider someone – call him Derek – who believes that the
    2020 US presidential election was stolen for Joe Biden, and that in reality Donald
    Trump received far more votes. For my money, these beliefs are not supported by
    the available evidence, and are thus unreasonable. But, for all that, Derek might
    have a totally coherent worldview. His beliefs certainly could be logically consistent:
    there’s some imaginable situation (in philosophers’ lingo, a ‘possible world’)
    in which all of them are true. Moreover, Derek might *think* that his beliefs
    are well supported by the available evidence, thinking that the information provided
    on QAnon message boards, by One America News, and by Trump himself is extremely
    weighty evidence, and that information provided by the mainstream media is entirely
    unreliable. Like many conspiracy theorists, Derek might [dismiss](https://philpapers.org/rec/NAPCTA)

  zh: 要理解这一点的吸引力，可以将不一致与仅仅是*不合理*进行对比。考虑某人——称之为德里克——他相信 2020 年美国总统选举是为了乔·拜登而被偷走的，而实际上唐纳德·特朗普获得了更多的选票。我认为，这些信念没有得到现有证据的支持，因此是不合理的。但尽管如此，德里克可能有一个完全一致的世界观。他的信念肯定是逻辑一致的：有一种可想象的情况（在哲学术语中，称为“可能世界”），在其中所有这些信念都是真实的。此外，德里克可能*认为*他的信念得到了现有证据的充分支持，认为
    QAnon 消息板、美国有线新闻网和特朗普本人提供的信息是极具份量的证据，并且主流媒体提供的信息完全不可靠。像许多阴谋论者一样，德里克可能会[否认](https://philpapers.org/rec/NAPCTA)对他观点的证据，声称这是由恶意行为者伪造的。
- en: Consequently, although I think that Derek’s beliefs are unreasonable, this is
    hard to demonstrate conclusively in a way that’s neutral on the weighty disagreements
    that Derek and I have. I can point to my trusted sources of information – mainstream
    media outlets, those who reviewed the votes, members of state election boards
    – that say I’m right and he’s wrong. But Derek rejects those sources as biased
    or shills or dupes. So he won’t be impressed by my arguments that his beliefs
    are unreasonable. And, indeed, there’s a way in which it makes sense, given his

    then, the thought is, I can show that he’s being irrational without having to
    settle which sources of information are reliable, or what counts as good evidence

    Similar issues arise with intentions. Suppose a politician intends to do whatever

    legal immigration easier would benefit small businesses in his constituency (by
    increasing their labour pool). By pointing out that this combination is incoherent,
    I can show that the politician is being irrational while skirting various weighty
    disagreements we might have. I may disagree both with the politician’s plan to
    vote against the bill *and* with the importance he attaches to helping small businesses
    at whatever cost. Perhaps I support the bill for reasons having nothing to do
    with small businesses – say, because I think we have a moral duty to prospective
    immigrants to make legal immigration easier and safer – that the politician would,
    in turn, reject. But showing the politician’s views about these issues to be unreasonable
    would be very hard: these disputes turn on difficult, hard-to-settle contentions
    about morality and value. Pointing out that a vote against the bill would knowingly
    frustrate the politician’s own goals is both an easier way to show the irrationality

- en: As well as illustrating how charges of irrationality are usually easier to vindicate
    when someone is incoherent than when they’re merely unreasonable, these cases
    also bring out the thought that the incoherent person is irrational in a *deeper*

    he’s less than ideal, but if his beliefs don’t even hang together coherently,
    he’s *really* screwed up. Indeed, [some](https://philpapers.org/rec/BRODRC) deny
    that mental states that are merely unreasonable merit the label ‘irrational’,
    wanting to apply that label only to incoherence. Ultimately, I think this goes
    too far. Just as Derek can be unreasonable yet coherent, so can those with progressively
    wackier views – climate-change deniers, flat-Earthers, people who are convinced
    that fairies live in their gardens. It’s overwhelmingly natural to describe at
    least the most delusional of these beliefs as irrational, no matter how internally
    coherent they are. With this in mind, some philosophers – including me, along
    with my sometime co-author Daniel Fogal – have suggested we use the label ‘substantive
    rationality’ to refer to reasonableness, and ‘structural rationality’ to refer
    to coherence. Whatever labels we use, though, the key point is that reasonableness

  zh: 证明某人不合理的指控往往比证明其仅仅不合理更容易，这些案例也揭示了这样一个想法：不合理的人比不合理的人更深层次地不合理。如果 Derek 的信念不受证据支持，那他还算不上理想，但如果他的信念甚至连内部逻辑都不连贯，那他就*真的*搞砸了。确实，[有些人](https://philpapers.org/rec/BRODRC)否认仅仅不合理的精神状态值得被称为“不合理”，只想将这个标签应用于不连贯的情况。最终，我认为这太过分了。正如
    Derek 可以不合理但连贯一样，持有逐渐疯狂观点的人也可以。——气候变化否认者、地平论者、坚信花园里有仙女的人。——至少描述其中最妄想的这些信念为不合理是极其自然的，无论它们内部逻辑有多么连贯。考虑到这一点，一些哲学家——包括我和我的合著者丹尼尔·福格尔——建议我们使用标签“实质理性”来指代合理性，“结构理性”来指代连贯性。无论我们使用什么标签，关键点是理性和连贯性是两个完全不同的事物。
- en: It’s a truism of contemporary middlebrow discourse that human beings are deeply
    irrational. According to a simplified but not entirely fabricated popular narrative,
    classical economists naively assumed that individuals are perfectly rational,
    before contemporary psychology (and ‘behavioural economics’) came along to burst
    their bubble by experimentally demonstrating the depths of human irrationality.
    Irrationality-talk in public discourse got another boost from the advent of Trumpist
    politics, with academic [books](https://www.abc-clio.com/products/a5383c/) and
    newspaper op-eds frequently using the word in characterising Trump and his devotees.

    *Fitting Things Together* (2021) – the key to solving this puzzle can be found
    by paying attention to the difference between cases in which our mental states
    are *transparent* to us and those in which they aren’t. Roughly, mental states
    are transparent to us when we are fully and consciously aware of having them.
    As many [psychologists](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013827)
    and [philosophers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40606018) have argued in recent
    decades, our mental states are often not transparent to us: we can be unaware
    of, or deceived about, what we believe, desire, intend, hope and fear. My contention
    is that the cases where people most clearly have incoherent mental states are
    those in which their mental states are not perfectly transparent to them. It’s
    not particularly hard to make sense of incoherence in these cases; what’s harder
    to make sense of is incoherence that persists even when the incoherent states
    in question are brought to the attention of the person who has them.'

  zh: 在我看来 – 我在我的 [书](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fitting-things-together-9780197608142?cc=us&lang=en&)
    *Fitting Things Together* (2021) 中辩护 – 解决这个谜题的关键可以通过注意我们的心理状态在我们和那些不是的情况之间的差异。大致而言，当我们完全和有意识地意识到自己拥有这些状态时，我们的心理状态对我们是透明的。正如近几十年来许多
    [心理学家](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013827) 和 [哲学家](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40606018)
    所辩论的那样，我们的心理状态通常对我们并不透明：我们可能不知道，或被欺骗关于，我们相信，渴望，打算，希望和恐惧的内容。我的观点是，人们最明显具有不一致心理状态的情况是那些他们的心理状态对他们来说并不完全透明的情况。在这些情况下理解不一致并不特别困难；更难理解的是即使这些不一致的状态被注意到的人也继续存在的不一致状态。

    all Trump supporters are morally bad people: only a morally bad person, she says,
    could still support Trump after his demeaning comments about women, record of
    cruelty toward immigrants, and mocking of the disabled. But suppose Julie also
    knows that Brenda, the bartender at her local, is a Trump supporter. And suppose
    that if she were asked, outside of any discussion of Trump, whether Brenda is
    a morally bad person, she would say that she is not.'

  zh: 举例说明会更好。考虑某人 – 称之为 Julie – 她声称所有特朗普的支持者都是道德上有缺陷的人：她说，只有一个道德上有缺陷的人，才会在特朗普对女性的贬低言论，对移民的残酷行为以及对残疾人的嘲笑之后仍然支持特朗普。但假设
    Julie 也知道她当地的酒吧里的调酒师布伦达是特朗普的支持者。假设如果在任何关于特朗普的讨论之外问她，布伦达是一个道德上有缺陷的人吗，她会说她不是。
- en: 'Julie has a set of beliefs – that all Trump supporters are morally bad people,
    that Brenda is a Trump supporter, and that Brenda is not a morally bad person
    – that are incoherent. She can sustain these beliefs, I think, if she never thinks
    about all of them at once. But if someone were to point out to Julie that she
    holds all three beliefs, we’d expect her to immediately revise one of them. She
    might say something like: ‘OK, OK, not *all* Trump supporters are morally bad
    people – not *Brenda*.’ Or, perhaps: ‘Oh yeah, Brenda’s a Trump supporter. Well,
    I guess she is a morally bad person after all.’ What would be downright bizarre
    is if she just continued to confidently affirm all three claims – that all Trump
    supporters are morally bad people, that Brenda is a Trump supporter, and that
    Brenda is not a morally bad person – together. If she did that, we’d suspect she
    was confused (‘she can’t really mean *all*’) or insincere. This suggests that
    what’s hard to make sense of is not incoherence as such – Julie can manage that
    – but *transparent* incoherence.'

    them together, and that’s how we manage to sustain the incoherence. The point
    is even clearer when it comes to other kinds of incoherence, like cyclical preferences.
    Suppose I have three options for what to do this afternoon: finishing that article
    I’ve been working on, volunteering at the homeless shelter, or binge-watching
    the latest season of my favourite Netflix show. When thinking only about the options
    of finishing the article and volunteering at the homeless shelter, finishing the
    article seems like an important project that I can justifiably pick over volunteering,
    that also allows me to stay home in my PJs and not have to interact with anyone:
    I prefer finishing the article to volunteering. When thinking only about the options
    of volunteering at the homeless shelter and binge-watching Netflix, choosing to
    do something so trivial as watching TV rather than volunteering seems callous:
    I prefer volunteering to binge-watching. But when thinking only about the options
    of binge-watching Netflix and finishing the article, finishing the article seems
    difficult and energy-consuming, and Netflix seems much more enticing: I prefer
    binge-watching to finishing the article. These preferences are cyclical. Again,
    I can sustain them if I never think about them all at once. What would be bizarre
    would be my transparently declaring all three preferences together.'

  zh: 我们中的许多人都像朱莉一样：我们持有不一致的信念，但从不同时考虑它们，这就是我们保持不一致的方式。当涉及到其他种类的不一致时，情况变得更加清楚，比如循环偏好。假设我有三个选择来安排今天下午的时间：完成我一直在努力的那篇文章，去无家可归者收容所做志愿工作，或者狂热地观看我最喜欢的
    Netflix 最新一季的节目。当只考虑完成文章和去无家可归者收容所的选择时，完成文章似乎是一个重要的项目，我可以有理由选择完成而不是去做志愿工作，而且这也让我可以呆在家里穿着睡衣而不必与任何人交流：我更喜欢完成文章而不是去做志愿工作。当只考虑去无家可归者收容所和狂热观看
    Netflix 时，选择做一些像看电视这样琐碎的事情而不是去做志愿工作似乎是冷酷的：我更喜欢去做志愿工作而不是狂热观看。但是当只考虑观看 Netflix 和完成文章的选择时，完成文章似乎很困难且耗费精力，而
    Netflix 似乎更有吸引力：我更喜欢狂热观看而不是完成文章。这些偏好是循环的。同样，如果我从不同时考虑它们，我就能保持这些偏好。奇怪的是，如果我明确地一起声明这三个偏好。
- en: 'Why is transparent incoherence bizarre? In my view, it’s because to count as
    genuinely having a certain mental state (an intention, a belief, a preference,
    etc), you need to have some tendency to make your other mental states coherent
    with it, when your mental states are transparent to you. For example, I suggested
    earlier that to count as genuinely intending to wear new shoes to the wedding,
    I need to have some tendency to also form intentions to do whatever I believe
    is necessary for this – for example, to go to the mall to buy some. We can now
    qualify this in a subtle but crucial way: I need to have some tendency to form
    the intention to go to the mall – when my intention to wear new shoes and my belief
    that to do this I must go to the mall are both transparent to me.'

  zh: 为什么透明的不一致会令人感到奇怪？在我看来，这是因为要真正具有某种心理状态（意图、信念、偏好等），当你的心理状态对你来说是透明的时候，你需要有一些倾向使你的其他心理状态与之保持一致。例如，我之前提到过，要算真正打算穿新鞋去参加婚礼，我需要有一些倾向去形成做任何我认为必要的事情的意图
    - 例如，去商场买一些东西。我们现在可以以一种微妙但至关重要的方式来修饰这一点：当我打算穿新鞋和我相信我必须去商场这一点对我都是透明的时候，我需要有一些倾向去形成去商场的意图。
- en: 'This is a conceptual point, not an experimentally demonstrable one: if I don’t
    have that tendency, I just don’t *count* as intending to wear new shoes to the
    wedding. Nevertheless, the view that I’m suggesting here fits with a lot of what
    we know from both science and our own experience. It fits with the way that psychologists
    can exploit ordering and framing effects in surveys to elicit responses that seem
    so utterly incoherent that practically no one would ever give all of them at once:
    plausibly, this is possible because the participants don’t consider all of their
    responses together at once. It fits with the fact that reporting one’s own incoherent
    states aloud in speech seems a lot stranger than merely *being* incoherent: this
    is because reporting the state aloud in speech requires bringing all the states
    to one’s conscious attention, making them transparent. And it explains why, when
    our incoherence is brought to our attention, we scramble to revise or reinterpret
    our mental states to make them coherent: ‘When I said “all”, I didn’t really mean
    *all*’; ‘I’ll do anything to help small businesses *within reason*’; and so on.'

  zh: 这是一个概念性的观点，而不是一个可以通过实验证明的观点：如果我没有那种倾向，那我就不算是打算穿新鞋去参加婚礼的人。然而，我在这里提出的观点与我们从科学和自己的经验中了解到的很多内容相符。它与心理学家如何利用调查中的排序和框架效应来引导看似完全不一致的回答相符，以至于几乎没有人会同时给出所有这些回答的情况相符：这可能是因为参与者没有同时考虑他们的所有回答。它与报告自己的不一致状态在语言中大声说出来似乎比仅仅*是*不一致要奇怪得多相符：这是因为在语言中大声报告状态需要将所有状态带到一个人的意识注意力中，使它们变得透明。它还解释了为什么当我们的不一致性被带到我们的注意力时，我们会匆忙修改或重新解释我们的精神状态以使它们一致：‘当我说“所有”时，我并不是真的指的是*所有*’；‘我会尽一切努力帮助小企业*在合理的范围内*’；等等。
- en: We’re often incoherent through inattention to our mental states, through failure
    to put them together to draw the obvious conclusions. Still, the fact that we
    do tend to revise our states to make them coherent *when they’re brought to our
    attention* suggests that there is a kind of rationality – structural, rather than
    substantive, rationality – that we at least tend to approximate. We may not be
    very reasonable creatures a lot of the time. But we are coherent creatures, to
    some degree, and under certain conditions. For this baseline level of coherence
    is built into what it is to even have beliefs, intentions, preferences and the
    whole gamut of human responses to the world.

  zh: 我们常常由于精神状态的不注意而无法表达一致，由于未能将它们放在一起来得出明显的结论。然而，事实上，我们确实倾向于修改我们的状态以使其一致，*当它们被带到我们的注意力时*，这表明存在一种理性
    - 结构性而非实质性的理性 - 我们至少倾向于接近。我们可能并不总是非常理性的生物。但在某种程度上，在某些条件下，我们是一致的生物。因为这种基本的一致性水平已经融入到了拥有信念、意图、偏好和整个人类对世界的反应中。
