    try locking the front or rear differential. Owner [VoyageATX](https://www.youtube.com/@VoyageATX)
    posted a video to YouTube where his [high-dollar electric pickup struggles](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/42188/ford-wants-to-boost-f-150-lightning-pickups-range-through-ota-updates)
    in the mud, losing out to a [Subaru Crosstrek](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-subaru-crosstrek-first-drive-review-specs-price-options-impressions)
    off-road. I'm not here to make fun of him, and I'm not even here to make fun of
    the truck. But we have to talk about this dystopian reality where a vehicle's
    promised features are far from guaranteed.

  zh: 这里显示的屏幕截图显示了Cybertruck在尝试锁定前后差速器时显示的消息。 车主[VoyageATX](https://www.youtube.com/@VoyageATX)在YouTube上发布了一个视频，在这个视频中，他的[高价值电动皮卡陷入泥潭](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/42188/ford-wants-to-boost-f-150-lightning-pickups-range-through-ota-updates)，输给了[Subaru
    Crosstrek](https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-subaru-crosstrek-first-drive-review-specs-price-options-impressions)。
    我不是来取笑他的，我甚至不是来取笑这辆卡车的。 但我们必须谈论这个乌托邦现实，其中车辆的承诺功能远非确保的。
- en: Of course, manufacturers have leaned on [OTA updates](https://www.thedrive.com/news/tesla-owners-say-autopilot-adas-failing-as-recall-update-hits-2-million-cars)
    for a while now. But it's poor procedure to roll out a model with missing functionalities
    and a promise that they'll be added in time. That's especially true when you've
    waited years for your rig like almost every Cybertruck owner has, "believing in
    the mission" and spending nearly six figures all the while.

  zh: 当然，制造商现在已经倚靠[OTA更新](https://www.thedrive.com/news/tesla-owners-say-autopilot-adas-failing-as-recall-update-hits-2-million-cars)一段时间了。
    但是，推出一个缺少功能的车型，并承诺会及时添加功能，这是一个不良的做法。 这在你等待了数年之后终于等到你的Cybertruck时尤其如此，“相信使命”，同时花费了几乎六位数的费用。
- en: A locking differential is one of the most fundamental off-road features. In
    short, it ensures that both wheels on an axle or drive unit are spinning at the
    same time. They help immensely with traction in slippery conditions, and the most
    hardcore four-wheelers offer them front and back. Dual-motor Cybertrucks will
    supposedly be that way, while tri-motor models only need one at the front since
    both rear wheels are independently powered.

  zh: 锁定差速器是最基本的越野功能之一。 简而言之，它确保了轴上或驱动单元上的两个车轮同时旋转。 它们在湿滑条件下提供了极大的牵引力，而且最强硬的四轮驱动车辆在前后都提供了它们。
    双电机Cybertrucks据说是这样的，而三电机模型只需要一个在前面，因为后轮都是独立驱动的。
- en: Now, we know that Cybertruck mules have tested with locking differentials. The
    pickup's lead engineer Wes Morrill commented on a video [posted to X](https://x.com/wmorrill3/status/1742071526642659754?s=20)
    (formerly Twitter) where the Cybertruck climbs a tricky hill, no problem. Morrill
    notes that three different trucks attempted the obstacle—one with fully disabled
    traction control and open differentials, another dual motor with front and rear
    lockers, and a tri-motor Cybertruck with a front locker. He argues the point that
    driver skill is the biggest difference-maker in off-road performance, and while
    that may be true, Cybertruck owners can't find out right now since their pickups'
    locking diffs are "coming soon."

  zh: 现在，我们知道Cybertruck的原型车已经测试过锁定差速器。 皮卡的首席工程师Wes Morrill在一个视频[发布到X](https://x.com/wmorrill3/status/1742071526642659754?s=20)(曾是Twitter)评论说Cybertruck毫无问题地爬上了一个棘手的山坡。
    Morrill指出，三辆不同的卡车尝试了这个障碍物——一辆完全禁用了牵引控制和开放差速器的车辆，另一辆双电机车辆带有前后锁定器，以及一辆三电机Cybertruck带有前锁定器。
    他认为，驾驶员技能是越野性能的最大不同制造者，虽然这可能是真的，但由于他们的皮卡的锁定差速器“即将推出”，Cybertruck车主现在无法找到这个答案。
- en: 'A quick search shows one Cybertruck owner being met with the same message earlier
    in January. [Cybertruck Owners Club](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/lockers-confirmed-but-not-yet-available-locking-differential-controls-coming-soon.11121/)
    members joked that maybe they could trade functionalities for locking diffs, like
    FM radio or seatbelt reminders. Another dismissed it and said, "This is typical
    and expected as an early adopter of brand new tech." (Yeah, OK.) Finally, someone
    addressed the elephant in the room: "Let''s hope it''s not a subscription feature."'

  zh: 快速搜索显示，一位Cybertruck车主在一月份早些时候也收到了同样的消息。[Cybertruck车主俱乐部](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/lockers-confirmed-but-not-yet-available-locking-differential-controls-coming-soon.11121/)的成员开玩笑说，也许他们可以用差速锁交换功能，比如FM收音机或安全带提醒。另一位车主对此不以为然，并表示：“作为全新科技的早期采用者，这是典型的和预料之中的。”（是的，好吧。）最后，有人提到了问题的核心：“希望这不会成为一个订阅功能。”
- en: There's been no word from Tesla saying locking differentials will be a subscription
    feature. As it seems, the functionality simply isn't ready for customer roll-out
    just yet. That doesn't make it acceptable, but it reinforces that this massively
    anticipated vehicle launch is being muddied by what should have been when customers
    first took delivery.

  zh: 特斯拉方面尚未就差速器锁定功能是否将成为订阅功能发表任何言论。似乎，该功能目前还没有准备好供客户使用。这并不意味着可以接受，但这进一步表明，这一备受期待的车型发布活动正因为在客户首次交付时应该完成的事情而变得混乱不堪。
