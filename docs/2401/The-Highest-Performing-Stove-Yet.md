> 来源：[https://www.impulselabs.com/](https://www.impulselabs.com/)

## More power to you.

Our powerful burners peak at 10 kW, boiling a liter of water in 40 seconds. Who says a watched pot never boils?

## Culinary precision.

Best-in-class temperature sensors in every burner keep things dialed in. Imagine: no more burnt garlic or spaghetti water boiling over.

## Everything at your fingertips.

With a large, user-friendly, and intuitive LCD interface placed front and center, cooking has never felt (or looked) so good.

## No elbow grease required.

Magnetic, easily removable knobs lay flush on the cooktop, meaning you can take care of clean-up before your soup gets cold.

## One battery. Many benefits.

Battery power means energy bill savings while helping reduce strain on the grid and your electrical panel. Plus, with 3 kWh of energy, it can cook meals during an outage.

## Installation, simplified.

Designed to fit inside most standard countertops and work seamlessly with 120V or 240V connections. We’re making it easy to say yes to electric.
