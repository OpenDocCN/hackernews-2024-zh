- en: In addition to supporting thousands of developers using Unreal Engine all around
    the world, *Live++* is used by more than 100 companies on their proprietary engines
    and frameworks, working on some of the biggest and best-selling IPs and franchises
    in the industry.

- en: Live++ is "Edit and Continue that actually works". Programmers at Asobo Studio
    have been using it throughout development of Asobo Studio's C++-based products
    (millions of lines of code). It has become a standard part of our workflow, increasing
    developer productivity (and happiness 😊).

- en: I came to rely on Live++ in an almost unhealthy way. There's no C++ code I am
    working on where it can't be profitably used. It's integrated in minutes and gets
    me reliably around seconds or even minutes long program re-starts. Live++ also
    became my investigation sandbox in which I can explore and refactor my running
    code. I hunt down bugs by querying and testing my code interactively and old-school
    debugging methods get a modern spin - debug prints and runtime variable modification
    on steroids.

- en: Seeing Live++ in action seems like magic, and it very well might be. Aside from
    our Unreal projects we used it on a game with a custom engine and a very long
    iteration cycle. Over the five years of development, Live++ likely saved us months
    by avoiding the dreaded "change line - compile - load - test - repeat" cycle and
    letting us experiment and implement the game logic while the game was running.
    Between integration taking just a few minutes, and the free trial being available,
    there really isn't an excuse to not give it a try!

    to iterate and debug so much faster. No longer needing to restart the game/editor
    to apply changes is fantastic, but being able to deoptimize the current file has
    been a godsend for productivity. Can't recommend it enough!

- en: Live++ has been a game changer for me. The ability to make changes to code while
    the application is running supercharges iteration times and makes tweaking and
    tuning behaviours so much easier. It's also come in handy a number of times when
    debugging an issue. Being able to add extra logging/instrumentation without having
    to restart the application is incredibly useful.

    to a codebase without live editing feels like stepping into the distant past.
    Iterating faster lets me stay focused, save time, save money, and honestly just
    be happier every day while working.
