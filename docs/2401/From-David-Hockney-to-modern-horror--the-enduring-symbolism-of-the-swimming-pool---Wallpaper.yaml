- en: Perhaps there was something in the water. But it didn’t take David Hockney long
    to paint a swimming pool after he crossed the pond to Los Angeles in 1964\. Within
    a few months of moving to the city that, as Frank Lloyd once quipped, is what
    you would get if you tipped the world upside down and dislodged everything loose,
    the pop painter found a subject he would cling to for decades.

  zh: 或许水中有什么特别之处。但是 David Hockney 并没有花费太长时间在 1964 年横渡大西洋来到洛杉矶后就画了一幅游泳池。在搬到这座城市几个月后，正如弗兰克·劳埃德曾经说过的那样，这座城市就像是你把世界倒过来并将一切松散的东西都摆放了出来。这位波普画家找到了他会紧紧抓住几十年的一个主题。
- en: A swimming pool first trickled into the corner of Hockney’s painting California
    Art Collector (1964); one featured more prominently in Picture of a Hollywood
    Pool of the same year. Both acrylics, they coated Hockney’s honed style with his
    newfound sense of Cali Cool. Although he was only dipping a toe into the water,
    early signs of what was to come – a perfect stone border surrounding the pool,
    squiggly dark blue waves – lay within.

  zh: 游泳池首次出现在 Hockney 的绘画《加利福尼亚艺术收藏家》（1964年）的一角；同年的《好莱坞游泳池的图片》中更突出地出现。这两幅丙烯作品，用他新发现的加利福尼亚风格涂抹了
    Hockney 的磨练风格。尽管他只是在水里泡了一下脚，但早期的迹象已经显现——环绕游泳池的完美石头边缘，蜿蜒的深蓝波纹——都已经存在。
- en: 'And so began his deep dive into the subject, one which saw Hockney produce
    scores of paintings and collages centred on the swimming pool, including The Splash
    series completed in 1967 and a collection of lithographs. The beauty of Hockney’s
    swimming pools is that they never appear hackneyed, always new to the eye. So
    much so that his work is still being shown and with some verve; David Hockney:
    Drawing From Life is currently on at the National Portrait Gallery and Bigger
    & Closer has just finished at London’s Lightroom.'

    to experience projections of the paintings in the venue’s capacious space. Swimming
    pools, of course, abound; an entire “chapter” of the narrative is dedicated to
    them. “We were able to play with scale to make visitors feel like they’re really
    in these paintings - projecting onto all four walls and the floor. Nico Muhly
    wrote a beautiful score for the chapter which is as close to the feeling of being
    in a pool as I think it’s possible to get in musical form,” says 59 Productions

    Muhly 为这一章写了一段美丽的乐曲，这在音乐形式上几乎是达到了在游泳池中的感觉的极限，”59 Productions 的联合创始人马克·格里默说道。
- en: But Hockney is far from a lone figure when it comes to this aquatic topic. Indicative
    of this is another UK exhibition, Bathers, which was on display at Saatchi Yates
    in the summer. The show collated dozens of paintings depicting subjects caught
    in the act of swimming, skinny dipping and diving. Alongside two Hockneys, it
    included the Floating Figure II by Neil Stokoe, who studied at the RCA at the
    same time as Hockney. “Influence is a tricky thing as it's not linear. It's a
    swirling, cybernetic vortex,” says Neil’s son Jack, noting that the inspiration
    between Hockney and Stokoe’s style may have worked both ways.

    RCA 就读时创作的《漂浮人物 II》。尼尔的儿子杰克说：“影响是一件棘手的事情，因为它不是线性的。它是一个旋涡般的、控制论的漩涡，”他指出霍克尼和斯托克的风格之间的灵感可能是双向的。

- en: 'The exhibit’s sprawling timeline, spanning from 1662 to 2023, is a reminder,
    of course, that Hockney did not invent the pool picture. The Bradford-born painter
    did, though, start a ripple effect, reframing the swimming pool, which first sprung
    up in Britain around the mid-nineteenth century, as something alluringly sensual
    and tacitly tactile. This is highlighted by the vast amount of new work that featured
    in Bathers: thirteen of the pieces were painted this year.'

  zh: 展览的横跨时间线，从 1662 年到 2023 年，当然提醒了人们，霍克尼并不是游泳池画的发明者。出生于布拉德福德的画家确实引发了涟漪效应，重新构想了游泳池，它最早在英国约在十九世纪中叶出现，被重新塑造成一种诱人的感官和隐含的触感。这在
    Bathers 中展示的大量新作品中得到了突显：其中十三幅作品是今年绘制的。
- en: Many such artists have assumed the swimming pool as their main muse, all working
    to distil its true essence. Eric Fischl’s suburban imagery, which also featured
    in Bathers, frequently contains poolside families and lovers, capturing the domestication
    of swimming. Chan Wai Lap obsessively documents pools that remind him of his childhood,
    including a huge sculpture outside Hong Kong Museum of Art installed earlier this
    year. Kate Williams, too, is currently creating a buzz for her quilts depicting
    gorgeous, geometric pools.

- en: Artist and writer Leanne Shapton meanwhile brings a multidisciplinary approach.
    Her illustrated book *Swimming Studies* followed her journey from competitive
    swimming to composing swimming pool pictures, writing with a balletic fluidity.
    “I wanted an accounting of every pool I’d swum in. I work in series, where the
    quantity and repetition wind up being parts of a whole,” she explains. Each illustration
    is represented in grid format. “It equalises each pool— so the 1992 Olympic Trials
    50m venue is given the same treatment as the overchlorinated Holiday Inn Express
    pool in Minnesota,” she explains.

  zh: 艺术家兼作家 Leanne Shapton 则采用了多学科的方法。她的插图书籍 *Swimming Studies* 讲述了她从竞技游泳到创作游泳池画作的旅程，以一种芭蕾舞般的流畅书写。“我想要记账我游过的每一个泳池。我是按系列工作的，数量和重复最终构成了整体的一部分，”她解释道。每幅插图都以网格格式表示。“它使每个泳池都相等——所以
    1992 年奥运会选拔赛的 50 米场馆与明尼苏达州过度氯化的 Holiday Inn Express 泳池被给予了同样的对待，”她解释道。
- en: Shapton also wrote the foreword for Lou Goddard’s 2020 book *Pools*. “I was
    given a lot of freedom for that introduction. Lou asked me out of the blue and
    I liked the look of the book, I found it very evocative and seductive,” Shapton
    says. Her introduction paints the pool as a blank canvas, pointing to its ability
    to take on new meanings. “A pool. Look at it. It's a smooth, contained and containing
    body of water, a blank canvas, a fresh sheet of paper, a zero-gravity ride of
    a sort,” she writes.

    说道。她的介绍将游泳池描绘成了一个空白画布，指出了它接纳新意义的能力。“一个游泳池。看它。它是一个光滑、封闭和包容的水体，一个空白的画布，一张新鲜的纸张，一种零重力的体验，”她写道。

- en: For Hockney, it was all about the lifestyle. The swimming pool, a rare luxury
    in the UK, was more in reach in LA, an object of affordable affluence and accessible
    aspiration. “David points out [for the voiceover of the exhibit] that we think
    of swimming pools in the UK as symbols of luxury, whereas they’re much more commonplace
    in California, and that’s reflected in how they appear in our cultures too,” Grimmer
    says.

  zh: 对于霍克尼来说，一切都关乎生活方式。在英国，游泳池是一种罕见的奢侈品，在洛杉矶更容易得到，是一种负担得起的富裕象征和可及的向往。“大卫指出[对于展览的配音]，我们认为在英国，游泳池是奢侈的象征，而在加利福尼亚，它们更加普遍，这也反映在它们在我们文化中的出现方式上，”格里默说。
- en: Regardless, swimming pools are still expensive to design, build and maintain,
    a sign of financial comfort and leisure time that spans from suburban gardens
    all the way up to the vertiginous roofs of opulent hotels. Lazily lying on a lilo
    in a private pool is a sexy, not quiet, luxury. “Hockney captured the care-free,
    light-filled land of possibility that Los Angeles represented to a young man from
    Bradford in the 1960s,” Grimmer adds. “As a symbol of warmth, brightness, fun,
    sexiness, it’s hard to beat an outdoor pool in California.”

- en: Perhaps this sense of luxury is why high fashion, too, has used the swimming
    pool as a springboard. Simon Porte Jacquemus has frequently included the swimming
    pool in his campaigns and last year created a surreal interactive activation in
    Selfridges, Le Bleu, complete with actors enacting scenes in changing rooms, dazzling
    tiles and pristine blue lockers. “One of Jacquemus’ first shows was in a swimming
    pool. We wanted to explore their world,” says Seb Price, a lead creative from
    Random Studio, which worked on the project. For Price, the value is in the sense
    of voyeurism. “The cabins served as a great way to contain surprises and narrative
    elements, allowing visitors to discover and play, to hide and reveal…the changing
    room is a place of privacy, but it is also very public,” he says.

  zh: 或许正因为这种奢华感，高级时尚也将游泳池作为跳板。西蒙·波尔特·雅克穆斯经常在他的广告活动中包含游泳池，去年在Selfridges创造了一个超现实的互动体验，蓝色，包括演员在更衣室中扮演场景，令人眼花缭乱的瓷砖和一尘不染的蓝色储物柜。“雅克穆斯的第一个展示之一就是在一个游泳池里。我们想探索他们的世界，”项目工作的主要创意Seb
    Price来自Random Studio，他说，价值在于窥视感。“小屋是一个很好的容纳惊喜和叙事元素的方式，让游客发现和玩耍，隐藏和揭示...更衣室是一个私密的地方，但也是非常公开的，”他说。
- en: 'While Le Bleu was a temporary build, swimming pools are of course in themselves
    a form of architecture and sculpture. From grand Victorian public baths through
    to cutting-edge, state-of-the-art infinity pools, they are as much a water feature
    as a space for athleticism (though, as Grimmer dryly notes: “I can tell you from
    personal experience that Leyton Leisure Centre at 9am on a Saturday is about as
    far from architectural art as it’s possible to get.”)'

- en: It’s why some swimming pools have become multi-purpose venues, from the stunning
    La Piscine Museum in Lille to Goldsmiths' converted art studios to Victoria Baths
    in Manchester, taken over by Chanel in December 2023\. They can even display other

- en: This swimming pool also offers the chance for artists to experiment with form.
    “I suspect that Neil's interests were formal. Something about the figure, the
    water, the immersion and less of the lifestyle," Jack Stokoe says. “It presents
    a particularly enticing challenge for an artist because you're using a fluid medium
    to depict a fluid media but creating a still image,” he adds. This also applies
    to Neil’s friend, Hockney. “There is a difficulty to painting water, whether it’s
    a swimming pool, a pond, a puddle, a river, a shower or a lawn sprinkler (he’s
    painted all of them),” Grimmer says. “Painting water is a technical challenge
    that Hockney relished - and still does.”

  zh: 这个游泳池也为艺术家提供了实验形式的机会。“我怀疑尼尔的兴趣是形式上的。关于人物、水、沉浸，而不是生活方式的东西，”杰克·斯托克说。“对于艺术家来说，这是一个特别诱人的挑战，因为你正在使用一种流动的媒介来描绘一个静止的图像，”他补充道。这也适用于尼尔的朋友，霍克尼。“绘制水是一种困难，无论是游泳池、池塘、水坑、河流、淋浴还是草坪喷水器（他都画过），”格里默说。“绘制水是一种技术挑战，霍克尼乐此不疲——而且至今如此。”
- en: But for those of us who enjoy, rather than create, art from afar the real enigmatic
    magnetism at the centre of the swimming pool is memory. Both private and public
    pools take us back to the amplified warbles of school swimming lessons, the blissful
    escape from heat on heady summer holidays and swirling thoughts worked through
    during long, solo swims. Price used a chlorine-inspired scent in La Bleu to stimulate
    this. “It brought people closer to the feeling of this nostalgia, to the sensation
    of being present in a changing room,” he says. Shapton, meanwhile, believes it
    reinstates our earliest state of being. “It’s a womb. Life-giving, mysterious,”
    she says.

    Bleu中使用了一种受氯气启发的香味来刺激这一点。“它让人们更接近这种怀旧的感觉，更接近于在更衣室的感觉，”他说。与此同时，夏普顿认为它恢复了我们最早的存在状态。“这是一个子宫。赋予生命，神秘，”她说。
- en: Some of these memories are tarnished by a sense of darkness. Cinema has long
    depicted this; for every luxurious scene there are two tarred by the same brooding
    brush, representing something malevolent lurking in the water, from *The Swimming
    Pool* (1969) to upcoming horror film *Night Swim*, featuring a haunted pool. “Movies
    are awash with people who shouldn’t be in pools ending up in pools with other
    people who also shouldn’t be in pools,” Grimmer says. “There is a fear of going
    in the deep end. A contained body of water can still be somewhere you can die,”
    Jack Stokoe agrees, pointing to the cruciform figurine in Man in Floating Figure
    II.

- en: But while the swimming pool still represents this decadence and sense of potential
    danger, swimming has become more about wellbeing than being well off. This is
    especially true following the pandemic, which saw interest in outdoor swimming

    one’s mind than about luxury or hedonism,” he says. “If the backyard pool in the
