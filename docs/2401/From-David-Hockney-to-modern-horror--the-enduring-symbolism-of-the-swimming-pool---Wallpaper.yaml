    to paint a swimming pool after he crossed the pond to Los Angeles in 1964\. Within
    a few months of moving to the city that, as Frank Lloyd once quipped, is what
    you would get if you tipped the world upside down and dislodged everything loose,
    the pop painter found a subject he would cling to for decades.

    Art Collector (1964); one featured more prominently in Picture of a Hollywood
    Pool of the same year. Both acrylics, they coated Hockney’s honed style with his
    newfound sense of Cali Cool. Although he was only dipping a toe into the water,
    early signs of what was to come – a perfect stone border surrounding the pool,
    squiggly dark blue waves – lay within.

    scores of paintings and collages centred on the swimming pool, including The Splash
    series completed in 1967 and a collection of lithographs. The beauty of Hockney’s
    swimming pools is that they never appear hackneyed, always new to the eye. So
    much so that his work is still being shown and with some verve; David Hockney:
    Drawing From Life is currently on at the National Portrait Gallery and Bigger
    & Closer has just finished at London’s Lightroom.'

    to experience projections of the paintings in the venue’s capacious space. Swimming
    pools, of course, abound; an entire “chapter” of the narrative is dedicated to
    them. “We were able to play with scale to make visitors feel like they’re really
    in these paintings - projecting onto all four walls and the floor. Nico Muhly
    wrote a beautiful score for the chapter which is as close to the feeling of being
    in a pool as I think it’s possible to get in musical form,” says 59 Productions
    co-founder Mark Grimmer.

    of this is another UK exhibition, Bathers, which was on display at Saatchi Yates
    in the summer. The show collated dozens of paintings depicting subjects caught
    in the act of swimming, skinny dipping and diving. Alongside two Hockneys, it
    included the Floating Figure II by Neil Stokoe, who studied at the RCA at the
    same time as Hockney. “Influence is a tricky thing as it's not linear. It's a
    swirling, cybernetic vortex,” says Neil’s son Jack, noting that the inspiration
    between Hockney and Stokoe’s style may have worked both ways.

    of course, that Hockney did not invent the pool picture. The Bradford-born painter
    did, though, start a ripple effect, reframing the swimming pool, which first sprung
    up in Britain around the mid-nineteenth century, as something alluringly sensual
    and tacitly tactile. This is highlighted by the vast amount of new work that featured
    in Bathers: thirteen of the pieces were painted this year.'

    to distil its true essence. Eric Fischl’s suburban imagery, which also featured
    in Bathers, frequently contains poolside families and lovers, capturing the domestication
    of swimming. Chan Wai Lap obsessively documents pools that remind him of his childhood,
    including a huge sculpture outside Hong Kong Museum of Art installed earlier this
    year. Kate Williams, too, is currently creating a buzz for her quilts depicting
    gorgeous, geometric pools.

    Her illustrated book *Swimming Studies* followed her journey from competitive
    swimming to composing swimming pool pictures, writing with a balletic fluidity.
    “I wanted an accounting of every pool I’d swum in. I work in series, where the
    quantity and repetition wind up being parts of a whole,” she explains. Each illustration
    is represented in grid format. “It equalises each pool— so the 1992 Olympic Trials
    50m venue is given the same treatment as the overchlorinated Holiday Inn Express
    pool in Minnesota,” she explains.

    given a lot of freedom for that introduction. Lou asked me out of the blue and
    I liked the look of the book, I found it very evocative and seductive,” Shapton
    says. Her introduction paints the pool as a blank canvas, pointing to its ability
    to take on new meanings. “A pool. Look at it. It's a smooth, contained and containing
    body of water, a blank canvas, a fresh sheet of paper, a zero-gravity ride of
    a sort,” she writes.

    for artists? And what does it symbolise beneath the surface?

    in the UK, was more in reach in LA, an object of affordable affluence and accessible
    aspiration. “David points out [for the voiceover of the exhibit] that we think
    of swimming pools in the UK as symbols of luxury, whereas they’re much more commonplace
    in California, and that’s reflected in how they appear in our cultures too,” Grimmer
    says.

    a sign of financial comfort and leisure time that spans from suburban gardens
    all the way up to the vertiginous roofs of opulent hotels. Lazily lying on a lilo
    in a private pool is a sexy, not quiet, luxury. “Hockney captured the care-free,
    light-filled land of possibility that Los Angeles represented to a young man from
    Bradford in the 1960s,” Grimmer adds. “As a symbol of warmth, brightness, fun,
    sexiness, it’s hard to beat an outdoor pool in California.”

    pool as a springboard. Simon Porte Jacquemus has frequently included the swimming
    pool in his campaigns and last year created a surreal interactive activation in
    Selfridges, Le Bleu, complete with actors enacting scenes in changing rooms, dazzling
    tiles and pristine blue lockers. “One of Jacquemus’ first shows was in a swimming
    pool. We wanted to explore their world,” says Seb Price, a lead creative from
    Random Studio, which worked on the project. For Price, the value is in the sense
    of voyeurism. “The cabins served as a great way to contain surprises and narrative
    elements, allowing visitors to discover and play, to hide and reveal…the changing
    room is a place of privacy, but it is also very public,” he says.

    a form of architecture and sculpture. From grand Victorian public baths through
    to cutting-edge, state-of-the-art infinity pools, they are as much a water feature
    as a space for athleticism (though, as Grimmer dryly notes: “I can tell you from
    personal experience that Leyton Leisure Centre at 9am on a Saturday is about as
    far from architectural art as it’s possible to get.”)'

    La Piscine Museum in Lille to Goldsmiths' converted art studios to Victoria Baths
    in Manchester, taken over by Chanel in December 2023\. They can even display other
    forms of art; just last month, John Lennon's psychedelic swimming pool mosaic
    went on auction, expecting to fetch six figures.

    “I suspect that Neil's interests were formal. Something about the figure, the
    water, the immersion and less of the lifestyle," Jack Stokoe says. “It presents
    a particularly enticing challenge for an artist because you're using a fluid medium
    to depict a fluid media but creating a still image,” he adds. This also applies
    to Neil’s friend, Hockney. “There is a difficulty to painting water, whether it’s
    a swimming pool, a pond, a puddle, a river, a shower or a lawn sprinkler (he’s
    painted all of them),” Grimmer says. “Painting water is a technical challenge
    that Hockney relished - and still does.”

    magnetism at the centre of the swimming pool is memory. Both private and public
    pools take us back to the amplified warbles of school swimming lessons, the blissful
    escape from heat on heady summer holidays and swirling thoughts worked through
    during long, solo swims. Price used a chlorine-inspired scent in La Bleu to stimulate
    this. “It brought people closer to the feeling of this nostalgia, to the sensation
    of being present in a changing room,” he says. Shapton, meanwhile, believes it
    reinstates our earliest state of being. “It’s a womb. Life-giving, mysterious,”
    she says.

    depicted this; for every luxurious scene there are two tarred by the same brooding
    brush, representing something malevolent lurking in the water, from *The Swimming
    Pool* (1969) to upcoming horror film *Night Swim*, featuring a haunted pool. “Movies
    are awash with people who shouldn’t be in pools ending up in pools with other
    people who also shouldn’t be in pools,” Grimmer says. “There is a fear of going
    in the deep end. A contained body of water can still be somewhere you can die,”
    Jack Stokoe agrees, pointing to the cruciform figurine in Man in Floating Figure
    II.

    danger, swimming has become more about wellbeing than being well off. This is
    especially true following the pandemic, which saw interest in outdoor swimming
    and lidos spiral. “Perhaps it is their minimalist aesthetic, their lack of modernity
    and technology, or perhaps the effect of social media, that otherwise ordinary
    spaces are now the protagonists of our media,” Price thinks.

    one’s mind than about luxury or hedonism,” he says. “If the backyard pool in the
    Hollywood Hills represented 1960s Los Angeles, I think a brisk swim in a cold
    outdoor Lido in London feels more apposite to the here and now.”
