`#!` (pronounced shebang) is a Unix convention that's typically used for scripting languages like Python and Bash. This abuses it to let you package applications in a cross-distro and cross-platform way. This example Dockerfile is a fullstack server that includes a backend, a database and a UI, all in a single file.

It's kinda like [Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan) but for packaging applications.

Why not?

Probably not.

If you want.

Maybe.

No.

Yes.

```
chmod +x ./Dockerfile
./Dockerfile
```

Then go to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
