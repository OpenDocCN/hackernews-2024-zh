    but the TL;DR is that Cochrane executed a brilliant plan, beached the entire French
    navy, but an idiot admiral who was more concerned with his sailors reading psalms
    than with anything involving naval affairs didn’t send ships to destroy the beached
    French navy

    a leader of men, and a man of uncompromising principle. but if there is one lesson
    to learn from him, it’s that applying explosives wisely can solve most problems.
    if there’s a second lesson to learn, it’s that “a brilliant plan that is too dumb
    for anyone to reasonably attempt because of the odds against them may well succeed
    because nobody expects brilliant people to do such stupid hopeless things”
