- en: Ordinarily, in order to establish communications at locations such as disaster
    sites, rescuers have to transport and set up relatively bulky, costly satellite
    dishes. Soon, however, a simple tubular antenna made of woven strips of material
    may get the job done.

- en: Developed by scientists from Stanford University and the American University
    of Beirut, the prototype device is a form of what's known as a helical antenna.
    In general, this type of antenna consists of one or more conductive wires wound
    in a helix (like a corkscrew) around a central support mast.

- en: The new "bi-stable deployable quadrifilar helix antenna" does away with the
    support, and replaces the wires with strips of a conductive fiber composite material
    – these are wound together in a helix pattern, to form a hollow cylinder.

    about one foot tall (305 mm), or pushed down to form a ring about one inch tall
    by five inches across (25 by 127 mm).

    [ground plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_plane) and battery – the antenna
    emits a low-power signal in all directions, allowing for radio communications
    with ground-based team members. In its *short* state, it sends a high-power signal
    in a specific direction, allowing for satellite communications.

    of each individual antenna.

    This means that when pulled or pushed by hand, it will automatically pop itself
    into the desired configuration – so there's no guesswork as to whether or not
    it's been properly deployed, whether at a disaster site, battlefield, or potentially
    even in a spacecraft.

- en: '"The state-of-the-art solutions typically employed in these areas are heavy,
    metallic dishes. They’re not easy to move around, they require a lot of power
    to operate, and they’re not particularly cost-effective," said Stanford''s Asst.
    Prof. Maria Sakovsky. "Our antenna is lightweight, low-power, and can switch between
    two operating states. It’s able to do more with as little as possible in these
    areas where communications are lacking."'
