    7 or 8 years old. I’m sitting in an experiment room in Tolman Hall, a Brutalist
    building on the north side of the University of California, Berkeley, campus.
    In the room, there are two people: a man and me. For the past hour or so, he has
    been asking me questions about myself, my relationships with my family members,
    and who I imagine I might grow up to be.'

    us. In fact, I’m starving. It’s been hours since I ate my brown-bag lunch on the
    playground of the alternative grade school that I attend in the Berkeley flatlands
    alongside kids who have names like Sunshine and Storm. Sensing this is a test,
    I search the man’s face for the right answer, but it’s a blank slate. Unsure what
    the correct response is or what I’m being tested on, I hesitate.

    sister isn’t riding horses at an equestrian center in the Berkeley Hills, she
    ignores me or bullies me. Mostly left to my own devices, I retreat into my room,
    where I play with my dollhouse, escape into books, or arrange my stuffed animals
    into complex tableaux of domestic strife.'

    Founded in 1927 with financial support from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial,

    childhood development got young human subjects, and professors and staff got convenient,

    was made for spying on children. In its T-shaped building, a hidden observation
    gallery was tucked between mirror-twin classrooms and outdoor play yards; across
    a maze of walkways, in a rectangular building, testing rooms were outfitted with

    the fall of 1972, I became one of a cohort of over 100 Berkeley children whose
    parents had enrolled us in a groundbreaking, 30-year longitudinal study of personality
    that would attempt to answer a simple question: If you study a child, can you
    predict who that child will grow up to be? Formally, the study is named *Block
    and Block Longitudinal Study, 1969–1999*. Colloquially, it’s referred to as the
    Block Study. Those of us who comprised its cohort knew it as the Block Project.
    The study was the brainchild of married UC–Berkeley personality researchers Jack
    and Jeanne Block, who set out to demonstrate that, as the poet William Wordsworth
    wrote: “The Child is father of the Man.”'

    collected “L.O.T.S.” of data on us: L-data, our *life* history, demographic information,
    and schooling; O-data, the *observations* of the study’s examiners, our parents,

    personality tests, galvanic skin response, and more); and S-data, our *self-reported*
    data (what we disclosed in interviews). Our report cards were considered. Psychologists
    analyzed us. At 6, we were studied at home. We were assessed one-on-one, with
    one parent, or with both parents. Our parents were asked about their child-rearing
    strategies, their marriages and divorces, and our relationships with our siblings,
    if we had any. Our personality traits and characteristics were quantified and
    cataloged; among them were our ability to delay gratification, our distractibility,
    our capacity for curiosity, our interest in risk-taking, our creative expression,
    our level of ambition, our “moral development,” and our egocentrism.'

    who abstain from drugs altogether and teens who abuse drugs heavily; and that,

    stopped. After that, I didn’t think about the study or my experiences in it too
    often. That I had grown up under a microscope had seemed perfectly normal to me;
    it was all I had ever known. I had no memory of a time in my life when I *wasn’t*
    in the study. Then, in early 2010, I was reading the New York Times online when
    a [headline](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/07block.html) caught my eye:
    “Jack Block, Who Studied Young Children Into Adulthood, Dies at 85.” *I was one
    of those young children*, I thought. In 1981, I knew, Jeanne had died at 58 of
    pancreatic cancer, midway through their project. Now Jack was gone too, due to
    complications related to a spinal cord injury suffered a decade prior. It appeared
    the final chapter of the Block Project had been written.'

    What if I dug up something I didn’t like? I couldn’t rebury it and pretend I had
    never discovered it. As an investigative journalist, I had written stories in
    which I had exposed *other people*; the prospect of exposing *myself* filled me
    with dread. What I didn’t know was that unearthing my curious history would change
    everything. As I recovered from breast cancer, as my marriage imploded, as I moved
    from one side of the country to the other, as I returned to Berkeley to live in
    an in-law apartment less than a mile from the house in which I was raised, as
    I went through archives, tracked down files, and interviewed researchers, I began

    need a perfect mother, but a “good-enough mother,” who “is neither good nor bad
    nor the product of illusion, but is a separate and independent entity.” My mother
    was cool and detached, neither touchy nor feely; a feminist who graduated from
    Mount Holyoke College and claimed to have read Betty Friedan’s *The Feminine Mystique*
    while pushing a vacuum cleaner; a woman who might never have had children had
    she been born decades later. For my mother, motherhood was a tax being levied
    upon her. “I don’t want to be a mother anymore,” she would say, oblivious to or
    disinterested in how I, who wanted a mother, would take this proclamation or what
    I was to do with it.

    there, watching over me, keeping an eye on me. It made sure I was alive, thriving,
    and surviving. The study was deeply invested in my outcome, as it dedicated itself
    to constructing a nuanced portrait of who I was, who I wanted to be, who I would
    become. After my parents’ divorce, I was despondent, having been left with an
    unhappy mother and longing for my absent father. In my teens, I experimented with
    drugs, ran away from home, got drunk and disappeared into frat-row rooms with
    young men who were unaware I was underage and who, for all I knew, were my father’s
    students. My researchers knew me better than I knew myself, were my intimate companions
    with whom I shared my secrets, were father confessor and deliverer of absolution
    in contrast to my parents’ devout atheism. Even when I was in a dangerous place,
    I could feel a connection between the study and me, like a gossamer thread spun
    from inside of it and wrapped around me.

    their life’s work. Today, the collectors of our digital data are multibillionaires
    with murky agendas and opaque ethics, whose interests aren’t in predicting future
    behavior but in steering it with algorithms designed to make our choices for us,
    founders and CEOs who, like Logan Roy on HBO’s *Succession*, view people as “economic
