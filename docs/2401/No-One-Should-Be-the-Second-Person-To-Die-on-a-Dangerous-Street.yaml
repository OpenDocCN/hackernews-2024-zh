    the image above, which illustrates one small step every municipality across North
    America has the power to initiate to address a safety concern at an intersection.
    The image illustrates an intersection where the design communicates to the driver
    that they can increase in speed. The driver is able to take the turn at a higher
    speed without stopping or slowing. The problem is that at a high speed, the driver
    may not see a pedestrian in the crosswalk, increasing the probability of a crash. Implementing
    a bulb-out forces the driver to slow down, and makes the street safer for people
    to cross.'

- en: Our roadway designers have become crippled by the mandated approaches of roadway
    design and highway standards that are handed down to them from the federal and
    state government. These design standards are informative, but the approaches do
    not address every problem we find on our roadways. More importantly, if the mandate
    results in a dangerous street, we should not wait for a better mandate to be created.

  zh: 我们的道路设计师已经被从联邦和州政府传下来的道路设计和公路标准的强制性方法所束缚。这些设计标准是有用的，但是这些方法并不能解决我们在道路上遇到的每一个问题。更重要的是，如果强制性规定导致了危险的街道，我们不应该等待更好的强制性规定被制定出来。
- en: The context and site constraints when designing streets at the level of the
    block are too complex than what could ever be imagined at a state-wide level,
    let alone at the national level. Each of our cities are responding to issues unique
    to every municipality. That is why our roadway engineers have years of education
    and are certified and registered in every state. They are anointed technical experts
    in their field provided with the education and knowledge that allows them to make
    on-the-ground decisions. There is never a single, broad-brush solution to meet
    the needs of our very diverse communities.

    found in all of our communities. It was designed and stamped by a registered engineer.

- en: Once an intersection has been constructed, we can observe and learn more about
    driver behavior on it. This is new information that the design engineer did not
    have. Due to the geometries and visually wide lanes, the road feels wider, resulting
    in drivers speeding around the corner. The mandated design does not address how
    drivers in this community are using the road.

- en: The dangers of this intersection may also be increased because of other conditions
    unknown at the time of the design. It is also possible that after the roadway
    was built, a new neighborhood or school was constructed on this street, increasing
    the volume of pedestrians using the crosswalk. We cannot conceive of every possible
    scenario at the outset, and conditions like this change all the time in cities.

- en: If a municipality was informed of a dangerous condition in a park or a roof
    leak in a public building, municipal staff would jump into action by rolling out
    yellow caution tape or by placing orange cones around the danger. They would explore
    a lot of small ideas as to what they could do with available resources to eliminate
    the danger. This is a scenario that plays out in cities everyday.
