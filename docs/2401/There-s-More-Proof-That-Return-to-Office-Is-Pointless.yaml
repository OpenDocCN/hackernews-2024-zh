    U.S. firms’ return-to-office (RTO) mandates,” said researchers from the Katz Graduate
    School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. The study found that managers
    use RTO mandates “to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a
    scapegoat,” and concluded that “we do not find significant changes in firm performance
    in terms of profitability and stock market valuation after the RTO mandates.”

- en: The study analyzed all 137 firms on the S&P 500 that have publicly announced
    RTO plans since the coronavirus pandemic introduced remote work. Researchers also
    looked into the motivation behind RTO mandates and found that firms led by male
    CEOs with greater power are more inclined to enforce an RTO policy. Power was
    defined as the CEO’s total compensation divided by the average compensation of
    the firm’s highest-paid executives. There was no correlation between a CEO’s political
    affiliation or percentage of stake in the company and an RTO mandate.

    ratings of work-life balance, senior management, and cultural values all had significant
    decreases in the face of return-to-office policies.

    return-to-office mandates do little to boost productivity, according to [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/23/remote-work-productivity-wfh-report).
    The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco examined 43 industries and concluded
    that the shift to remote and hybrid work had [no substantial impact on productivity](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2024/january/does-working-from-home-boost-productivity-growth/).

    closely examined one anonymous Fortune 500 company. It found that working close
    to others may increase mentorship, but has no significant impact on productivity.
