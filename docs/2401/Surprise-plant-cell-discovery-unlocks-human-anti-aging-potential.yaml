- en: Scientists have discovered a new contender in the quest to hack the human aging
    process, and it’s a little-studied protein within a cell structure that also doesn’t
    get a lot of airtime in research despite being one of the first organelles identified
    more than a century ago.

- en: The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi body and Golgi complex (much to
    the chagrin of biology students the world over), is an odd-looking organelle resembling
    folded pasta sheets or layers of icing. But it has an important role within complex
    plant and animal cells, processing and packaging proteins and lipids, before they’re
    transported to other parts of the cell or secreted.

    researching the nervous system at the time, so it’s fitting that University of
    California Riverside (UCR) scientists also stumbled across a particular aspect
    of the organelle in their study on plant stressors – and it’s one that holds great
    promise for preserving cell longevity.

    of molecular biochemistry at UCR. “For the first time, we have defined the profound
    importance of an organelle in the cell that was not previously implicated in the
    process of aging.”

    responses to stressors such as infection and poor light, the researchers found
    that the Golgi apparatus, and a key protein within it, played a large role in
    cell survival when exposed to external stress.

    (carbohydrates) to other proteins and lipids before moving these packages on.
    This process, glycosylation, is critical for cell function and [many biological
    processes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-019-0129-4), such as protein
    folding and adaptive immune response function.

    a researcher in the Botany and Plant Sciences Department at UCR. “They package
    and send out proteins and lipids to where they’re needed. A damaged Golgi can
    create confusion and trouble in the cell’s activities, affecting how the cell
    works and stays healthy.”

    worker, overseeing the movement of small sac ‘envelopes’ that move other molecules
    around the cell.

- en: Focusing on COG, the researchers modified plants to be unable to produce the
    protein naturally. While the plants grew normally in optimal conditions, they
    rapidly went downhill when deprived of light so they are unable to convert sunlight
    to sugar. In fact, the COG-less plants wilted, yellowed and looked close to death
    three times quicker than unmodified specimens with the same light deprivation.

    wild, unmodified plants around day nine,” Choi said. “But in the mutants, these
    signs manifested in just three days,”

    up and they resembled the ‘normal’ specimens. Dehesh said it was “like nothing
    happened to them once we reversed the mutation.”

    Golgi function in stress management,” Choi added.

    to those of animals, all of us with complex – eukaryotic – cells have a Golgi
    apparatus ‘post office’ within each one.

    has found that malfunctions in the human COG complex, made up of eight COG protein
    subunits, significantly impacts crucial biological roles such as glycosylation,
    protein sorting and overall Golgi apparatus workings. [Golgi glycosylation malfunction](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241814073)
    and dysregulation has also been implicated in the proliferation of cancer cells
    and disease progression.'

    in human cells, and its potential association with aging and the impact of stress.
    Potentially, targeted therapies could bolster cell health to shield against stressors
    that can cause premature aging.

    it could also provide crucial clues about aging in humans,” Dehesh said. “When
    the COG protein complex doesn't work properly, it might make our cells age faster,
    just like what we saw in plants when they lacked light. This breakthrough could
    have far-reaching implications for the study of aging and age-related diseases.”
