- en: When it comes to improving privacy on the web, the work is never finished. That's
    why in Chrome, we continue to invest in [features that protect your data and provide
    more control over how it’s used](https://www.google.com/chrome/#safe). This includes
    taking steps to limit the ability to track your activity across different websites.

- en: On January 4, we'll begin testing Tracking Protection, a new feature that limits
    cross-site tracking by restricting website access to third-party cookies by default.
    We'll roll this out to 1% of Chrome users globally, a key milestone in our [Privacy
    Sandbox initiative](https://privacysandbox.com/) to phase out third-party cookies
    for everyone in the second half of 2024, subject to addressing any remaining competition
    concerns from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.

- en: Third-party cookies have been a fundamental part of the web for nearly three
    decades. While they can be used to track your website activities, sites have also
    used them to support a range of online experiences — like helping you log in or
    showing you relevant ads.

- en: With the Privacy Sandbox, we’re taking a responsible approach to phasing out
    third-party cookies in Chrome. We’ve built new tools for sites that [support key
    use cases](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd), and [provided
    time for developers](https://privacysandbox.com/open-web/#the-privacy-sandbox-timeline)
    to make the transition. And as we introduce Tracking Protection, we’re starting
    with a small percentage of Chrome users so developers can test their readiness
    for a web without third-party cookies.
