    are lots of little ones and then some big ones along the way. This trains your
    optimism muscle like nothing else. But this also means living off the edge of
    the cliff most days, weeks, months.

    unknown, not walked by others is where you find most satisfaction, opportunity,
    creativity. Like the black parts of the map that turn green in Age of Empires
    , if you are old enough to remember the game.

    more fun and in fact more productive.

    practical. They are key. Maybe it is choosing the broader idea. Maybe it is the
    choice of a specific go-to-market motion or the people you work with or even your
    board and investors. Can be the market, the copy of your website. You can zoom
    in or zoom out infinitely. Once you do this, you become more intentional and being
    intentional makes taking jumps more controlled, hence they feel better.

    you stop being curious, you age. Not to be agist, but you come closer to an ending.
    However **what ifs** can be all-consuming and they are not productive. What if
    you did not hire a certain person or hired earlier, what if you chose a different
    feature set, what if you started fundraising earlier? Again you can zoom in and
    zoom out as you will. These are toxic. Instead, if a **what if** is bugging me
    a lot, I tend to design curiosity driven mini experiments that won’t take much
    resource but will get me my answers. If you are building, you are constantly looking
    for answers. Negative, positive. You need signal.

    tell you that you have to be ok with no-s, that you do not have to take them to
    heart. I would say you should proactively seek them. Because when you are making
    large bets you need to assign probabilities and count for uncertainty. Getting
    to **no-s** narrows down focus. Focus is what wins you the pieces of the pie and
    the whole pie in the end.

- en: Assign probabilities and plan around them. This helps with emotion control and
    damage control when you are taking bets. Reward yourself for the right guesses
    and refine the art of measuring what is to come. In the end you become exceptionally
    good at figuring out what is to come and/or at making it happen.

- en: Do not take yourself too seriously. This is a key part of the culture at my
    company, [Ntropy.](http://ntropy.com) Once you start to take yourself seriously,
    living off the edge becomes not feasible. What if you fall and lose everything?
    What would others think? What would you think? I think this is a known technique
    to fight fears, and I have been personally deploying it since I was very very
    young. Imagine the worst case scenarios. If you are like me you will picture even
    a couple of them, you can paint every detail, then get over it and move on. It
    is not that bad. You are not that important.

  zh: 不要太认真对待自己。这是我公司[Ntropy](http://ntropy.com)文化的关键部分。一旦你开始认真对待自己，勇敢走出困境就变得不切实际了。如果你跌倒了并失去了一切怎么办？别人会怎么想？你会怎么想？我认为这是一种应对恐惧的已知技巧，我个人从很小很小的时候就开始使用它。想象最坏的情况。如果你像我一样，你会描绘出一两个甚至更多的情景，你可以细致地描述每一个细节，然后克服它并继续前进。其实并没有那么糟糕。你并不那么重要。
