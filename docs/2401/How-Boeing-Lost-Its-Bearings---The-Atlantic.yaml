  zh: 把波音公司推向灾难道路的飞行在日出几小时后起飞。飞行天气很好——气温在摄氏 40 度左右，微风来自东南方向——但奇怪的是，没有人知道这架 737 喷气式客机要去哪里。机组人员准备了三份飞行计划：一个去丹佛。一个去达拉斯。还有一个去芝加哥。
- en: In the plane’s trailing vortices was greater Seattle, where the company’s famed
    engineering culture had taken root; where the bulk of its 40,000-plus engineers
    lived and worked; indeed, where the jet itself had been assembled. But it was
    May 2001\. And Boeing’s leaders, CEO Phil Condit and President Harry Stonecipher,
    had decided it was time to put some distance between themselves and the people
    actually making the company’s planes. How much distance? This flight—a PR stunt
    to end the two-month contest for Boeing’s new headquarters—would reveal the answer.
    Once the plane was airborne, Boeing announced it would be landing at Chicago’s
    Midway International Airport.

  zh: 飞机尾迹里是大西雅图地区，那里是公司著名的工程文化的发源地；公司的 40,000 多名工程师中的大部分生活和工作的地方；事实上，喷气机本身就是在这里组装的。但是那是
    2001 年 5 月。波音的领导人，首席执行官菲尔·康迪特和总裁哈里·斯通赛弗，已决定是时候与实际制造公司飞机的人们保持一定距离了。有多远的距离？这次飞行——为结束波音新总部两个月竞争而进行的一次公关噱头——将揭示答案。飞机一旦起飞，波音宣布它将降落在芝加哥的米德韦国际机场。
- en: 'On the tarmac, Condit stepped out of the jet, made a brief speech, then boarded
    a helicopter for an aerial tour of Boeing’s new corporate home: the Morton Salt
    building, a skyscraper sitting just out of the Loop in downtown Chicago. Boeing’s
    top management plus staff—roughly 500 people in all—would work here. They could
    see the boats plying the Chicago River and the trains rumbling over it. Condit,
    an opera lover, would have an easy walk to the Lyric Opera building. But the nearest
    Boeing commercial-airplane assembly facility would be 1,700 miles away.'

  zh: 在停机坪上，康迪特走出飞机，发表了简短的讲话，然后登上直升机，进行了对波音新公司总部的空中参观：摩顿盐公司大楼，一座坐落在芝加哥市区环路外的摩天大楼。波音的高级管理人员加员工——大约
    500 人——将在这里工作。他们可以看到船只穿行芝加哥河，火车隆隆而过。康迪特，一位歌剧爱好者，可以轻松步行到里尔克歌剧大楼。但最近的波音商用飞机组装设施将会有
    1,700 英里之遥。
- en: The isolation was deliberate. “When the headquarters is located in proximity
    to a principal business—as ours was in Seattle—the corporate center is inevitably
    drawn into day-to-day business operations,” Condit explained at the time. And
    that statement, more than anything, captures a cardinal truth about the aerospace
    giant. The present 737 Max disaster can be traced back two decades—to the moment
    Boeing’s leadership decided to divorce itself from the firm’s own culture.

  zh: 这种孤立是有意的。“当总部位于主要业务区域附近时——就像我们在西雅图的时候一样——企业中心不可避免地会被卷入日常业务运作中，”康迪特当时解释道。而这句话，胜过任何其他事情，都揭示了这个航空巨头的一个基本真相。目前的
    737 Max 灾难可以追溯到两个世纪前——波音领导层决定脱离公司自己的文化的那一刻。
- en: For about 80 years, Boeing basically functioned as an association of engineers.
    Its executives held patents, designed wings, spoke the language of engineering
    and safety as a mother tongue. Finance wasn’t a primary language. Even Boeing’s
    bean counters didn’t act the part. As late as the mid-’90s, the company’s chief
    financial officer had minimal contact with Wall Street and answered colleagues’
    requests for basic financial data with a [curt](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/10/02/288426/index.htm)
    “Tell them not to worry.”

  zh: 大约 80 年来，波音基本上是一个工程师协会。其高管持有专利，设计机翼，用工程和安全的语言交流。财务不是主要语言。即使是波音的会计也没有表现出来。直到
    90 年代中期，公司的首席财务官也很少与华尔街接触，对同事对基本财务数据的请求也是一声“别担心”回应。
- en: By the time I visited the company—for *Fortune*, in 2000—that had begun to change.
    In Condit’s office, overlooking Boeing Field, were 54 white roses to celebrate
    the day’s closing stock price. The shift had started three years earlier, with
    Boeing’s “reverse takeover” of McDonnell Douglas—so-called because it was McDonnell
    executives who perversely ended up in charge of the combined entity, and it was
    McDonnell’s culture that became ascendant. “McDonnell Douglas bought Boeing with
    Boeing’s money,” went the joke around Seattle. Condit was still in charge, yes,
    and told me to ignore the talk that somebody had “captured” him and was holding
    him “hostage” in his own office. But Stonecipher was cutting a Dick Cheney–like
    figure, blasting the company’s engineers as “arrogant” and spouting Harry Trumanisms
    (“I don’t give ’em hell; I just tell the truth and they think it’s hell”) when
    they shot back that he was the problem.

  zh: '当我访问公司的时候 - *《财富》*，在2000年，这种情况已经开始改变。在看着波音野外的科迪特办公室的时候，有54束白玫瑰来庆祝当天的收盘股价。这一变化始于三年前，波音对麦道公司进行了“反向收购”
    - 人们之所以这样称呼，是因为最终掌控了合并实体的是麦道的高管，而麦道的文化成为了主流。“麦道公司用波音的钱收购了波音公司，” 在西雅图的笑话这样说。柯迪特仍然掌控着公司，是的，并且告诉我忽略了一些人说有人“占领”了他，并将他在自己的办公室“软禁”。但是斯通塞弗看起来很像迪克·切尼，猛烈抨击公司的工程师们为“傲慢”，并且喷出哈里·杜鲁门的话语（“我不去坑它们；我只是说真话，他们认为那是坑”），当他们回击称他才是问题的时候。 '
- en: McDonnell’s stock price had risen fourfold under Stonecipher as he went on a
    cost-cutting tear, but many analysts feared that this came at the cost of the
    company’s future competitiveness. “There was a little surprise that a guy running
    a failing company ended up with so much power,” the former Boeing executive vice
    president Dick Albrecht told me at the time. Post-merger, Stonecipher brought
    his chain saw to Seattle. “A passion for affordability” became one of the company’s
    new, unloved slogans, as did “Less family, more team.” It was enough to drive
    the white-collar engineering union, which had historically functioned as a professional
    debating society, into acting more like organized labor. “We weren’t fighting
    against Boeing,” one union leader told me of the 40-day strike that shut down
    production in 2000\. “We were fighting to save Boeing.”

- en: One of the most successful engineering cultures of all time was quickly giving
    way to the McDonnell mind-set. Another McDonnell executive had recently been elevated
    to chief financial officer. (“A further indication of who in the hell was controlling
    this company,” a union leader told me.) That, in turn, contributed to the company’s
    extraordinary decision to move its headquarters to Chicago, where it strangely
    remains—in the historical capital of printing, Pullman cars, and meatpacking—to
    this day.

  zh: 有史以来最成功的工程文化之一迅速地让位给了麦道的心态。另一位麦道的高管最近被提升为首席财务官。（“一个更进一步的暗示这家公司到底是谁在控制，”一个工会领袖告诉我）。这反过来又促成了公司将总部迁往芝加哥的非凡决定，而这一决定今天在这个历史上的印刷业、普尔曼车和肉类包装业的首都中奇怪地留了下来。
- en: 'If Andrew Carnegie’s advice—“Put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch
    that basket”—had guided Boeing before, these decisions accomplished roughly the
    opposite. The company would put its eggs in three baskets: military in St. Louis.
    Space in Long Beach. Passenger jets in Seattle. And it would watch that basket
    from Chicago. Never mind that the majority of its revenues and real estate were
    and are in basket three. Or that Boeing’s managers would now have the added challenge
    of flying all this blind—or by instrument, as it were—relying on remote readouts
    of the situation in Chicago instead of eyeballing it directly (as good pilots
    are incidentally trained to do). The goal was to change Boeing’s culture.'

  zh: 如果安德鲁·卡内基的建议——“把所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，然后看着那个篮子”——曾经指导过波音公司，那么这些决定的结果则完全相反。 公司将其鸡蛋放在三个篮子里：军事业务在圣路易斯。
    长滩的航天业务。 西雅图的客机。 然后从芝加哥看着那个篮子。 不要紧，大多数收入和房地产都在第三个篮子里。 或者说波音的管理人员现在将面临额外的挑战，即盲目飞行，或者说按仪器操作，依靠芝加哥的远程读数，而不是直接目视（正如优秀的飞行员被培训的那样）。
    目标是改变波音的文化。
- en: 'And in that, Condit and Stonecipher clearly succeeded. In the next four years,
    Boeing’s detail-oriented, conservative culture became embroiled in a series of
    scandals. Its rocket division was found to be in possession of 25,000 pages of
    stolen Lockheed Martin documents. Its CFO (ex-McDonnell) was caught violating
    government procurement laws and went to jail. With ethics now front and center,
    Condit was forced out and replaced with Stonecipher, who promptly affirmed: “When
    people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so that it’s
    run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.” A General Electric
    alum, he built a virtual replica of GE’s famed Crotonville leadership center for
    Boeing managers to cycle through. And when Stonecipher had his own career-ending
    scandal (an affair with an employee), it was another GE alum—James McNerney—who
    came in from the outside to replace him.'

  zh: 在这一点上，康迪特和斯通赛弗显然取得了成功。 在接下来的四年里，波音这个注重细节、保守的文化陷入了一系列丑闻中。 其火箭部门被发现拥有25000页被盗的洛克希德·马丁文件。
    其首席财务官（前麦克唐纳）被发现违反了政府采购法，并被监禁。 随着伦理问题现在摆在首位，康迪特被迫离职，并被斯通赛弗接替，后者迅速确认：“当人们说我改变了波音的文化，那是我故意的，这样它就像一家企业运营，而不是一家伟大的工程公司。”
    作为一名通用电气的前员工，他为波音经理建立了通用电气著名的克罗顿维尔领导力中心的虚拟副本。 当斯通赛弗自己因职业生涯终结的丑闻（与一名员工的风流韵事）而遭受打击时，又是另一位通用电气的前员工——詹姆斯·麦克纳尼——从外部来接替他。
- en: As the aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia recently told me, “You had this weird
    combination of a distant building with a few hundred people in it and a non-engineer
    with no technical skills whatsoever at the helm.” Even that might have worked—had
    the commercial-jet business stayed in the hands of an experienced engineer steeped
    in STEM disciplines. Instead McNerney installed an M.B.A. with a varied background

    相反，麦克纳尼安装了一名M.B.A.，他在销售、市场营销和供应链管理方面有着丰富的背景。 阿布拉菲亚说，“我们就像，‘*什么？*’’’

    telling you their reservations, versus calling a manager [more than] 1,500 miles
    away who you know has a reputation for wanting to take your pension away. It’s

    这是一种非常不同的动态。 作为剥夺工程师特别是的配方，你找不到一个更好的格式。”
- en: And in some of the internal exchanges now coming to light, you can see the level
    of estrangement among engineers, operators, and executives that resulted. A Boeing
    vice president, Mike Sinnett, told American Airlines pilots that the MCAS software
    system implicated in the 737 Max crashes didn’t have “a single-point failure,”
    as reported—asserting that the pilots themselves constituted a second point of
    backup—showing both a misunderstanding of the term and a sharp break from Boeing’s
    long-standing practice of having multiple backups for every flight system. Meanwhile,
    experienced Boeing engineers rolled their eyes as some software-development tasks
    (not specific to MCAS) were outsourced to recent college grads earning as little
    as $9 an hour, who were employed by an Indian subcontractor set up across from
    Seattle’s Boeing Field.

  zh: 而在现在逐渐曝光的一些内部交流中，你可以看到工程师、操作员和高管之间的疏远程度。波音副总裁迈克·辛内特（Mike Sinnett）告诉美国航空公司的飞行员，737
    Max飞机坠毁中牵涉到的MCAS软件系统并非像报道的那样具有“单点失效”——他断言飞行员本身构成了第二个备份点——这既表明了对术语的误解，也与波音长期以来每个飞行系统都有多个备份的做法形成了鲜明对比。与此同时，有经验的波音工程师对一些软件开发任务（与MCAS无关）被外包给新近毕业的大学生，他们的工资可能只有每小时9美元，感到不满。这些大学生是由一个设在西雅图波音机场对面的印度分包商雇佣的。
- en: The current Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, is being pilloried for his handling
    of the disaster, and accused of harming the company by prioritizing profit. But
    the criticism misses the point, Aboulafia told me. “The difference between doing
