    was recently revealed as the upcoming second-tallest skyscraper in the United
    States. Designer AO is now aiming for even greater heights, however, and has carried

    Legends Tower, will reach a maximum height of 1,907 ft (581 m), instead of the
    originally planned 1,750 ft (533 m). This figure is symbolic, marking the year
    Oklahoma became the [USA's 46th state](https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/oklahoma).

    tallest building, New York City's [One World Trade Center](https://newatlas.com/one-world-trade-center-tallest-building-us/29762/).
    It will also put it at sixth-tallest in the world rankings, just behind China's
    [Ping An Finance Center](https://newatlas.com/kpf-ping-an-finance-centre/48698/).
