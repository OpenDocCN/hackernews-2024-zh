- en: Republicans and Democrats don’t seem to agree on much these days. But despite
    the gridlock in Congress, both political parties have for years supported spending
    billions on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education. Their
    goals include reducing perceived shortages of STEM workers, boosting American
    innovation and competitiveness and diversifying this highly paid workforce. The
    message of lucrative STEM careers appears to have reached students and tuition-paying
    parents — the number of STEM majors has surged in recent years.

    don’t work in STEM occupations. The Census Bureau reported in 2021 that a paltry
    28% of STEM grads are working in these supposedly in-demand, highly paid and important
    STEM jobs. These include diverse sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and
    energy, but about half of STEM jobs are in computers, and tech firms typically
    complain the loudest of STEM shortages.'

- en: One key factor is wages. Many able STEM grads bolt for better-paying careers,
    especially in business, finance, management and medicine (government programs
    focused on STEM exclude medical practitioners and are not designed to increase
    those numbers). Some do find high salaries in STEM jobs, many right out of college,
    especially in hot fields such as AI. But STEM grads even in the most dynamic sectors,
    including computer science and engineering, see their salary advantage fade over
    time, increasing the odds that they’ll leave for greener pastures.

    are not keeping most STEM grads in STEM jobs. Some of the wealthiest companies
    — Apple, Google, Adobe Systems and Intel — settled a class-action lawsuit for
    $415 million in 2015 after workers alleged employers used illegal means to prevent
    salary increases. Employers also incentivize moves from technical work to management
    with higher salaries at their own firms, yet many bemoan a shortage of technical
    STEM workers, not managers.

    We’ve been bombarded by images of young, happy-go-lucky STEM workers playing foosball
    and skateboarding to free snacks or meditation pods. But the more common experience,
    especially in tech, is grueling “crunch time” to rush a product out the door while
    worrying about the next performance review.

    both for employees and for the “shadow workforce” toiling on short-term contracts.
    This work stress affects both physical and mental health. Employees at Uber, Facebook
    and Google have taken their own lives, prompting discussion of the role of workplace
    culture in their deaths.

- en: Adding to the stress is the constant threat of layoffs. Even the richest firms
    regularly shed STEM workers as technologies or markets change or investors demand
    cost reductions. When Elon Musk took over Twitter and sacked more than half the
    workforce, other CEOs cheered. Musk was hardly a STEM trailblazer; workers in
    the high-demand field of IT are more likely to face layoffs than workers in most
    other industries. Especially vulnerable are expensive older workers and those
    who didn’t, or couldn’t, self-train to keep their skills relevant — an increasingly
    important practice because employer-provided training has dwindled over recent
    decades.

  zh: 增加压力的是不断裁员的持续威胁。即使是最富有的公司也经常裁减STEM工作者，因为技术或市场发生变化，或者投资者要求降低成本。当埃隆·马斯克接管推特并解雇了一半以上的员工时，其他CEO都在为他喝彩。马斯克几乎不是STEM的先驱者；IT领域需求量大的工作者比大多数其他行业的工作者更有可能面临裁员。尤其脆弱的是昂贵的老年工作者和那些没有或无法自我训练以保持自己技能相关性的人——这是一种日益重要的做法，因为雇主提供的培训在最近几十年已经减少。

- en: Employers facing STEM shortages should bend over backward to keep their scarce
    talent. Instead, research finds that STEM employers maintain unwelcoming environments
    for older workers as well as women and underrepresented minorities. Sheryl Sandberg,
    the former COO of Facebook (now Meta), blamed Facebook’s dearth of female software
    developers on universities and society for not graduating more female computer
    science and engineering majors. But why would women choose a sector where the
    numbers indicate they aren’t welcome? Where even blatant sexual harassment can
    go unpunished?

    Sandberg）将Facebook女性软件开发人员的匮乏归咎于大学和社会没有培养更多的女性计算机科学和工程专业毕业生。但为什么女性要选择一个数据表明她们不受欢迎的行业？即使明目张胆的性骚扰也可能不会受到惩罚？
- en: Some STEM grads also reject STEM jobs because so many are meaningless or even
    harmful. Workers have fled social media companies following concerns that they
    spread misinformation, erode democracy and foster teen depression. Fossil fuel
    companies struggle for STEM talent due to their damage to the planet. Trillion-dollar
    tech companies are often accused of unfair trade practices and “surveillance capitalism”
    that mines users for personal data. STEM grads who want to make the world a better
    place may struggle to find a fit.

    STEM worker shortages must understand that their wounds are self-inflicted. They

    eschew destructive business models.

- en: But investors repeatedly reward employers for treating STEM grads like fast
    fashion — discarded when broken or no longer appealing — or for deploying STEM
    skills in lucrative yet harmful business models. A better return on STEM education
    will require corporations to move away from maximizing short-term shareholder
    value and consider more stakeholders and moral limits on money making. Meanwhile,
    governments can lure investors to put more money in planet-saving technologies,
    as Congress did with the Inflation Reduction Act.
