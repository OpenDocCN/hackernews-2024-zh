[China Airlines Flight 5116](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/CAL5116/history/20231109/1745Z/RCTP) rocketed to a speed of 826 mph as it bolted eastward across the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, potentially breaking informal records for passenger travel. The commercial flight, which departed from Taipei, landed more than an hour early in Los Angeles, propelled by exceptionally strong tailwinds.
