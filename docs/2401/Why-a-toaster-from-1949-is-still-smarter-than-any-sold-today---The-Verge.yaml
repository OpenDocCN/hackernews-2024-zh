    to a modern toaster with two seemingly ingenious buttons: one to briefly lift
    your bread to check its progress, and another to toast it “a bit more.” I respectfully
    submit you shouldn’t need a button at all.'

    Sunbeam engineer Ludvik J. Koci invented the perfect toaster, one where the simple
    act of placing a slice into one of its two slots would result in a delicious piece
    of toasted bread. No button, no lever, no other input required. Drop bread, get
    toast.'

    the Sunbeam Radiant Control Toaster, sold from 1949 all the way through the late
    ‘80s. (It goes by many names, including the T-20A, T-20-B, T20-C, T-35, VT-40,
    AT-W and even the 20-30-AG.) In 2019, the YouTube channel Technology Connections
    famously explained [*precisely why* the antique Sunbeam Radiant is better than
    yours](https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&id=1025X1701640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1OfxlSG6q5Y),
    and it might be the smartest thing you watch today.'

    of bread into this toaster, it pushes down a series of cleverly designed levers
    that have just enough tension to lower and raise two slices all by themselves
    — *and* it’s got a mechanical thermostat inside that stops your bread toasting
    *when it’s toasted and ready*, NOT after some arbitrary amount of time.'

- en: 'With the Sunbeam, the heat radiating from the bread itself warms up a bimetal
    strip (one of the simplest kinds of thermostats) which, being made of two different
    kinds of metal that expand at different rates, ends up bending backwards to sever
    the connection and stop the flow of electricity when the toast is done. And here’s
    the most ingenious part: when the heating wire shrinks as it cools down, *that*
    is what triggers the mechanical chain reaction that lifts your bread back up.
    Here’s how Sunbeam describes it in the toaster’s [official service manual:](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1065925/Sunbeam-T20b.html#manual)'

    expansion and contraction of the Center Element wire. Of course, this movement
    is very small and is measured in thousandths of an inch, but more than adequate
    carriage movement is obtained by a simple linkage which multiplies this movement
    approximately 175 times.

    of use: there’s a single screw underneath the crumb tray to adjust the tension
    of the wire, and it alone is enough to bring many aging toasters back to life.'

    you get toast regardless of whether your bread is room temperature, refrigerated,
    or frozen when you stick it into the device.'

- en: That also makes it remarkably hard to accidentally burn your bread by toasting
    it too long! Remember the “A bit more” button on Tom’s toaster? The Sunbeam Radiant
    Control Toaster does that merely by dropping a toasted piece of bread back in
    the slot — it warms the bread right back to the temperature at which it browns,
    which browns the bread slightly more, before it trips the thermostat once again
    and shuts itself off.

    I bought my own off eBay. And then I bought a second and a third, because it turns
    out a Space Age artifact that produces delicious food is just the kind of wonderful
    conversation piece that makes for a wonderful gift, too. (Before giving them,
    I opened them up and replaced their aging power cords with modern grounded three-prong
    ones, as many of these predate even polarized plugs and are not remotely safe
    by modern electrocution prevention standards.)

    perfect. For one thing, there’s no ding to remind you when the toast is done —
    though these 1275- and 1375-watt toasters are powerful enough you might as well
    stick around for the minute or two it takes. (Let your tea steep, grab your butter
    and preserves.)

    aimed at the center of your piece of bread. Frozen waffles come out fantastic,
    but I have to carefully split English muffins perfectly in half so they don’t
    catch on the guide wires. And while slices of square sandwich bread crisp up beautifully,
    including the thin-cut Taiwan toast from my local bakery, thick or oblong breads
    don’t necessarily fit. (A wide slice of Oroweat Buttermilk or Nature’s Own Brioche
    Style might require a quick flip-and-retoast to crisp all the way across.)

    fluffy-and-moist-on-the-inside piece of toast my mom tells me she hasn’t had since
    she left *her own* mother’s kitchen.

    the $300 toaster oven where you add a splash of water so it “locks in the bread’s
    inner moisture before the surface is given a golden brown finish.” But I have
    to wonder if quickly crisping the outside with a dedicated vertical toaster, instead
    of baking it a second time in a miniature oven, might be a more elegant solution?
    I do own [a Panasonic FlashXpress](https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-NB-G110P-FlashXpress-Infrared-Removable/dp/B008C9UFDI?tag=theverge02-20),
    which often takes home best toaster oven awards, and its perfectly browned slices
    definitely don’t have the same taste the Sunbeam can provide.

    know they’re not all quite the same — you can read about the differences [here](https://www.timstoasters.com/models-years/)
    and [here](http://www.automaticbeyondbelief.org/dating.htm) — and you may have
    to pay quite a bit. They go for an average of $130 on eBay, with fully restored
    models fetching two to four times that at auction. (Tim’s Toasters also [promises
    to restore your existing Sunbeam for $250](https://www.timstoasters.com/restoration),
    though I can’t vouch for their work myself.)

    That’s $260 in today’s money, which may be why no other company has seemingly
