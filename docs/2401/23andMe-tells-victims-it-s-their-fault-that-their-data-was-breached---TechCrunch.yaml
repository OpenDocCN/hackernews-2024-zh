- en: In December, 23andMe admitted that [hackers had stolen the genetic and ancestry
    data of 6.9 million users](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/),

- en: The data breach started with hackers accessing only around 14,000 user accounts.
    The hackers broke into this first set of victims by [brute-forcing accounts with
    passwords that were known to be associated with the targeted customers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/),
    a technique known as credential stuffing.

  zh: 数据泄露始于黑客仅访问大约14,000个用户帐户。黑客通过[用已知与目标客户关联的密码试图暴力破解帐户](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/23andme-resets-user-passwords-after-genetic-data-posted-online/)，这种技术被称为凭证填充，进入了这一组受害者。
- en: From these 14,000 initial victims, however, the hackers were able to then access
    the personal data of the other 6.9 million victims because they had opted-in to
    23andMe’s [DNA Relatives](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170838)
    feature. This optional feature allows customers to automatically share some of
    their data with people who are considered their relatives on the platform.

  zh: 然而，从这14,000名最初的受害者中，黑客随后能够访问其他6,900,000名受害者的个人数据，因为他们已选择加入23andMe的[DNA亲属](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170838)功能。这个可选功能允许客户自动与平台上被认为是他们亲戚的人分享一些数据。

    the company, 23andMe said that “users negligently recycled and failed to update
    their passwords following these past security incidents, which are unrelated to
    23andMe.”

    many consumers use recycled passwords and thus that 23andMe should have implemented
    some of the many safeguards available to protect against credential stuffing —
    especially considering that 23andMe stores personal identifying information, health
    information, and genetic information on its platform,” Zavareei said in an email.

  zh: “这种指责毫无意义。23andMe 知道或应该知道许多消费者使用重复的密码，因此 23andMe 应该实施一些可用的许多保护措施来防范凭据填充 —— 特别是考虑到
    23andMe 在其平台上存储了个人身份信息、健康信息和遗传信息，” Zavareei 在一封电子邮件中说道。
- en: “The breach impacted millions of consumers whose data was exposed through the
    DNA Relatives feature on 23andMe’s platform, not because they used recycled passwords.
    Of those millions, only a few thousand accounts were compromised due to credential
    stuffing. 23andMe’s attempt to shirk responsibility by blaming its customers does
    nothing for these millions of consumers whose data was compromised through no
    fault of their own whatsoever,” said Zavareei.

    企图通过责备其客户来逃避责任，对这些数百万消费者毫无过失的数据泄露一事没有任何帮助。” Zavareei 表示。
