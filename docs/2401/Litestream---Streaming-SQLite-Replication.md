# Litestream - Streaming SQLite Replication

> 来源：[https://litestream.io/](https://litestream.io/)

## No-worry backups

Continuously stream SQLite changes to AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, SFTP, or NFS. Quickly recover to the point of failure if your server goes down.

## Use existing apps

Runs as a separate process so you can integrate into existing applications with no code changes.

## Dirt Cheap

Only costs pennies per day. Object storage is cheap so there's no need to waste money on additional servers.
