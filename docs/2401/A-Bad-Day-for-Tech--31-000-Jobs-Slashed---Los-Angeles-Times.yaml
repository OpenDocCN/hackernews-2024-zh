    job cuts Thursday, marking one of the worst days for layoffs since the tech bubble
    burst a year ago.

    the worst year in the industry’s history, caused analysts to wonder whether the
    carnage would get even worse and when it would come to an end.

- en: More than 300,000 tech jobs, nearly 40% of the U.S. total, have been eliminated
    in the first half of this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago
    outplacement firm. Along the way, the tech industry has fallen from its position
    as the U.S. economy’s hero to being its Achilles’ heel. New orders for equipment
    such as personal computers and other gadgets have shrunk at their fastest pace
    ever--49.2% on an annualized basis--in the last year, according Moody’s Investors
    Service Inc.

    in addition to the 5,800 cuts announced earlier this year. San Jose-based JDS
    Uniphase, which makes fiber-optic components, added 7,000 workers to its previous
    tally of 9,000 layoff victims. And Silicon Valley bellwether Hewlett-Packard Co.
    announced 6,000 layoffs as it warned that its revenue will be well below Wall
    Street’s expectations because of plunging consumer sales.

    sharply lower since then, averaging a relatively meager 23,762 cuts in the last

    trend will reverse.

    lay people off,” Hickey said. Now that it’s clear that the business climate isn’t
    likely to improve until next year, they could follow with more job cuts.”

    improvement in layoff announcements,” Reynnells said. “As long as companies are
    under this kind of pressure, there’s always going to be that looming layoff announcement.
    Maybe the worst is over, but it doesn’t preclude more of these things.”

    communications hardware to handle corporate data, Internet traffic and e-commerce
    transactions. Phone companies joined the buying spree, adding more hardware and

    that it would slash its work force by an additional 15,000 to 20,000 workers.
    Lucent also eliminated 17,000 positions by spinning off its semiconductor and
    optical components division into a separate company. When the cuts are done, Lucent
    will be left with 57,000 employees, less than half the 123,000 workers who began
    the year with the company.

    jobs since January.
