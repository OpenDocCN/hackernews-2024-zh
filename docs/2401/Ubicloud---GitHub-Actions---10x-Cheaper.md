# Ubicloud - GitHub Actions, ‍10x Cheaper

> 来源：[https://www.ubicloud.com/use-cases/github-actions](https://www.ubicloud.com/use-cases/github-actions)

## Open and Portable

Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.

You can check out our source code in GitHub, or use our managed runners for your GitHub Actions. Our managed service runs on cost-effective bare metal instances, which allows us to pass those savings to you.
