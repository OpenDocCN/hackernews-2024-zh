    Facebook, and optimizing the best route for navigation relies on humans feeding
    the AI some information to start. We show the algorithms which sentences are equivalent
    in other languages, what a person looks like in different photos, and how to plot
    the ideal course for a car.

- en: But some AI researchers are exploring how to give algorithms a sense of curiosity,
    so they can learn without any human guidance. New [research](https://pathak22.github.io/large-scale-curiosity/)
    from OpenAI, the non-profit AI lab founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and other
    Silicon Valley bigwigs, in collaboration with researchers from UC Berkeley and
    the University of Edinburgh, has found that when an AI algorithm is given a simple
    definition of curiosity, it can, without any human-provided information, explore
    more than 50 video games—and even beat some of them.

    agent was rewarded for seeing new things, sometimes it would die on purpose just
    to see the Game Over screen, or become enrapt with a fake TV and its remote, flipping
    through channel after channel to find something new.

- en: 'The definition that OpenAI team used for artificial curiosity was relatively
    simple: The algorithm would try to predict what its environment would look like
    one frame into the future. When that next frame happened, the algorithm would
    be rewarded by how wrong it was. The idea is that if the algorithm could predict
    what would happen in the environment, it had seen it before.'

    based in exploring ahead and getting to the next level.

- en: OpenAI researcher Harri Edwards tells Quartz that the idea for letting the AI
    agent flip through channels came from a thought experiment called the noisy-TV
    problem. The static on a TV is immensely random, so a curious AI agent could never
    truly predict what would happen next, and get drawn into watching the TV forever.
    In the real world, you could think of it as something completely random, like
    the way light shimmers off a waterfall.

- en: The researchers tested their theory by putting a digital TV inside a 3D environment,
    and allowing the agent to press a button to change the channel. When the agent
    found the TV and started flipping through the channels, the stream of new images
    made the TV irresistible.

    TV, but only when the AI’s surroundings somehow seemed more interesting than the
    next thing on TV.

- en: The point of this research isn’t just to beat video games with AI, but also
    to understand how algorithms might better interpret the world around them. Since
    these algorithms proved to be efficient at exploring all the nooks and crannies
    of video games, the researchers say they could also be adapted to make debugging
    code easier or to play through a video game to make sure there aren’t any glitches.
