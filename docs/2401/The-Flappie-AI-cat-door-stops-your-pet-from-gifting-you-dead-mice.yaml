    is no exception. Take Flappie, for example. [The Swiss start-up](https://www.flappie.ch/en/)
    is showing off an AI-powered cat door that automatically locks if your kitty tries
    to bring in prey it caught from the outside.

- en: On the side of the door facing the outside, you'll find a motion sensor and
    night-vision camera. Flappie says it has compiled a "unique and proprietary" dataset
    over the years, with a focus on diversity — this means getting lots of different
    kinds of cats as well as prey, filmed in a variety of different lighting conditions.
    The company says that its AI-powered detection system is accurate more than 90
    percent of the time, which means your cat could still get a mouse inside. But
    hopefully that'll happen a lot less frequently.

- en: There are some manual switches on the inside of the door so you can lock and
    unlock it any time you want as well as turn off the prey-detection system. Eventually,
    Flappie says that pets are likely to be trained that they can't enter when carrying
    something, and when they drop the prey the door will promptly unlock so they can
    get inside. (One of Flappie's co-founders admitted that a smart cat might figure
    out to drop the mouse, get the door open, pick it back up and then run in. But
    no solution is foolproof, right?)

    microchipped, you can make it so the cat door only opens for your specific pet.
    And, of course, there's an app so you can control the door from your phone. But
    if you're not inclined to hook the Flappie door up to the internet, it'll still
    work via the controls on the door itself.

- en: For starters, Flappie plans to launch its pet door in Switzerland and Germany
    later this spring, with plans to expand from there once it gets production scaled
    up. A US launch is part of the roadmap, but there's no word yet on when that'll
    happen, or how much the Flappie door might cost when it gets here. But [a CES
    newsletter](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&featureId=text-link&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21haWxjaGkubXAvMmViNjc3ZmYwMDdiL3N3aXNzdGVjaC1uZXdzLWF0LWNlcy11bnZlaWxlZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYWI2NDhkN2YtZjIwOS00YmZjLTk2MGEtOTYyYTgzOWJlZmVkIn0&signature=AQAAAUfk6Nj2rl1Y0QPexCTlh5ARgaIe5yAjSZxCB6WJGMYv&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmailchi.mp%2F2eb677ff007b%2Fswisstech-news-at-ces-unveiled)
    focused on Swiss tech companies says that Flappie will cost $399, or $199 with
    a two-year $8.90 monthly subscription to the app so you can see all the videos
