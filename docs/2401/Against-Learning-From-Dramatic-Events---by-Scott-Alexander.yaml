    an enormous attack once every (let’s say) 50 years. Then we would have calibrated
    the amount of resources we spent on counter-terrorism to a world with frequent
    small attacks, occasional large attacks, and once-per-50-years enormous attacks.
    We would have specifically thought things like “Once per 50 years, when the enormous

    Come on! You know that weapons exist that can kill thousands of people at once,
    you know that it’s physically possible for terrorists to obtain them, so you should
    assume that this will happen at some specific frequency. Then you should try to
    predict that frequency. Once you have a prediction, you should take the appropriate
    security measures. And if those fail and an enormous attack happens, then instead
    of freaking out and deciding that science fiction is true and your worldview has

- en: Obviously when a dramatic event happens, even if you don’t update your predictions
    for the future, you still need to respond to that particular event. For example,

- en: Obviously if you formed a model back in 2000 based on X data points, at some

- en: Obviously a dramatic event can reveal a deeper flaw in your models. For example,
    suppose there is an enormous terrorist attack, you investigated, and you found
    that it was organized by the Illuminati, who as of last month switched from their
    usual MO of manipulating financial markets to a new MO of coordinating terrorist
    attacks. You should expect new terrorist attacks more often from now on, since
    your previous models didn’t factor in the new Illuminati policy.

    A campaign against sexual abuse will only work if people believe that it will.
    That is, people will only want to join an anti-sexual-abuse campaign if they’ll
    be on the winning side - both because they don’t want to waste their time, and
    because they don’t want sexual abusers to retaliate against them. And their campaign
    will only win if many people support it. Most of the time, no individual anti-abuse
    crusader is sure enough of winning to start a campaign and get momentum behind
    it. But the Weinstein allegations produced a mood where everyone felt like “it
    was time” for an anti-sexual-assault campaign, so everyone believed such a campaign
    would work, so everyone was willing to support it, so it did work.

    - 这既是因为他们不想浪费时间，也是因为他们不想性虐待者报复他们。而他们的运动只有在许多人支持它时才能取得胜利。大多数时候，没有一个个人的反虐待骑士能够确信自己会赢得足够的支持来开始一场运动并在其背后形成动力。但是韦恩斯坦的指控产生了一种情绪，即每个人都觉得“是时候”进行反性侵犯运动了，所以每个人都相信这样一个运动会奏效，所以每个人都愿意支持它，所以它就奏效了。
