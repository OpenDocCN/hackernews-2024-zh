- en: When WIRED reached out to Tether Holdings—the company that issues the stablecoin
    that shares its name—it responded in a statement following publication of this
    article that “Tether proactively collaborates with global law enforcement agencies
    to identify and prevent illicit use of” its cryptocurrency, adding that its “commitment
    to the highest standards of compliance is evident in our efforts to eliminate
    various forms of criminal activity.”

    involved in scams or found to be violating the US Treasury's sanctions lists,
    and noted that all of its transactions, like many cryptocurrencies, can be publicly
    observed on blockchains—in other words, the observability that made Chainalysis's
    report possible. “Between our active and direct engagement with law enforcement
    and leveraging the transparent nature of blockchain transactions, individuals
    attempting to conceal their illicit financial activities face significant risks,
    as every transaction can be easily traced,” the company's statement reads.

    and sanctions evasion. It wrote that an October [*Wall Street Journal* article](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/most-popular-cryptocurrency-keeps-showing-up-in-illicit-finance-71d32e5e?mod=hp_lead_pos10)
    on the subject was based on “highly erroneous interpretations of data”—though
    in that case, the company pointed to Chainalysis findings as a more accurate accounting.
    “There is simply no evidence that Tether has violated Sanctions laws or the Bank
    Secrecy Act through inadequate customer due diligence or screening practices,”
    Tether Holdings wrote in an [October 26 blog post](https://tether.to/en/tether-reinforces-stance-against-cryptos-terrorist-utilization-urges-governments-to-fact-check-mainstream-medias-misinterpretation-of-data/)
    addressing the *WSJ* article.

- en: In contrast to most cryptocurrencies, Tether does have the capability to freeze
    user funds, and it said in the October blog post that since its launch in 2014,
    it had frozen $835 million in funds deemed to be tied to illicit activities. “Tether's
    ethos revolves around transparency, compliance, and proactive collaboration with
    relevant authorities worldwide,” the company wrote.

- en: Chainalysis' Fierman says that Tether's efforts to freeze criminal funds are
    having an impact, and more enforcement could help end stablecoins' exploitation
    by criminals. “Just as we’ve seen with compliant exchanges dominating more and
    more of total transaction volumes, illicit activity gets pushed to the fringes,”
    Fierman says.

- en: Despite Tether's ability to freeze funds, Chainalysis' data suggests that illicit
    use of stablecoins has so far dwarfed those seizures. West, the prosecutor, notes
    that most Tether associated with crime is cashed out for another currency long
    before anyone identifies it. That means Tether hasn't yet come close to solving
    the underlying problem.

    assets. “But when we're talking about billions and billions of dollars in assets
    moving, I just think this is one piece of one piece of the puzzle. There are so
    many more pieces. And the bad actors are so far ahead of us.”
