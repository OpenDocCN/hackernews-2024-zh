    I thought Apple might end up taunting the EU with any changes they implement to
    comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) laws set to take effect in March. And
    after a roughly [30 minute](https://www.threads.net/@mgsiegler/post/C2iQcgzL6r1?ref=spyglass.org)
    honeymoon period when folks thought Apple may actually be turning over a new leaf,
    it''s pretty clear how Apple feels about these changes that they''re being made
    to implement. Which is to say: [not great, Bob!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUWrl3-mc8&ref=spyglass.org)'

    they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities
    the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best

    marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to
    iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and

    developer.

    contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable,
    or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other
    than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts
    to system performance and battery life.

    security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible.
    For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed
    outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks
    their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that
    App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not
    be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.

    issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues,
    scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing,
    and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share
    their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities
    for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information.

    Apple may even have a point in many of the points above, but the framing of it
    would just seem to ensure that Apple is going to continue to be at war with the
    EU over all of this and the only question now is if these changes placate the
    body *at all*. Typically, if you're going make some changes and consider the matter
    closed, you don't do so while emphatically shoving your middle fingers in the
    air.

    convoluted changes to ensure the status quo actually doesn't change much, if at
    all. Just remember that, "importantly, developers can choose to remain on the
    same business terms in place today if they prefer." What do you think Apple prefers?
