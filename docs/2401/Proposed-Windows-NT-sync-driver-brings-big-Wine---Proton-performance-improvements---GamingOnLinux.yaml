    a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games
    and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.

    via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use
    these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.

- en: The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing
    primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent()
    or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control
    over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust
    for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements
    the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."

    uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments
    and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could
    end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming
    with Wine and Proton.
