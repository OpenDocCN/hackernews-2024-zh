- en: For reasons beyond the scope of this entry, I have been investigating elliptical
    and ovoid shapes. The [Wikipedia article for Moss‚Äôs egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss%27s_egg)
    has a link to [a tutorial on Euclidean Eggs by Freyja Hreinsd√≥ttir](https://web.archive.org/web/20200618202007/https://www.dynamat.oriw.eu/upload_pdf/20121022_154322__0.pdf)
    which (amongst other things) describes how to construct the ‚Äúfour point egg‚Äù.
    I think it is a nicer shape than Moss‚Äôs egg.

    so it lacks dimensions. Below is my version, with the numbers needed to draw it
    on a computer.

    arbitrary than they might appear to be. I have made [an interactive four-point
    egg](https://dotat.at/@/2024-01-eggsperiment.html) so you can drag the points
    around and observe how its shape changes.
