    [promotion](/wiki/Promotion_(marketing) "Promotion (marketing)") run by the British
    division of [the Hoover Company](/wiki/The_Hoover_Company "The Hoover Company")
    in late 1992\. The promotion, aiming to boost sales during the [global recession
    of the early 1990s](/wiki/Early_1990s_recession "Early 1990s recession"), offered
    two complimentary round-trip plane tickets to the [United States](/wiki/United_States
    "United States"), worth about [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling")600, to
    any customer purchasing at least £100 in Hoover products.^([[1]](#cite_note-thehustle-1))
    Hoover had been experiencing dwindling sales as a result of the economic downturn
    and a sharp increase in competing brands. Hoover was counting on most customers
    spending more than £100, as well as being deterred from completing the difficult
    application process, and not meeting its exact terms.

    由于经济衰退和竞争品牌急剧增加，Hoover的销售额一直在下降。Hoover指望大多数客户花费超过£100，并且被难以完成的申请流程所阻止，从而无法符合其确切条件。'
- en: Consumer response was much higher than the company anticipated, with many customers
    buying the minimum £100 of Hoover products to qualify. It was perceived as two
    US flights for just £100 with a free [vacuum cleaner](/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner "Vacuum
    cleaner") (or other product) included. The resulting demand was disastrous for
    the 84-year-old company. Hoover cancelled the ticket promotion after consumers
    had already bought the products and filled in forms applying for millions of pounds'
    worth of tickets. Reneging on the offer resulted in protests and [legal action](/wiki/Lawsuit
    "Lawsuit") from customers who failed to receive the tickets they had been promised.
    The campaign was a financial disaster for the company and led to the loss of Hoover's
    [Royal Warrant](/wiki/Royal_Warrant_of_Appointment_(United_Kingdom) "Royal Warrant
    of Appointment (United Kingdom)") after the airing of a 2004 BBC documentary.
    The European branch of the company was eventually sold to one of its competitors,
    [Candy](/wiki/Candy_(company) "Candy (company)"), having never recovered from
    the losses, the promotion and the subsequent scandal.

    "真空吸尘器")（或其他产品）。由此产生的需求对这家有着 84 岁历史的公司造成了灾难性的影响。Hoover在消费者已经购买了产品并填写了申请数百万英镑票券的表格之后取消了票务促销。取消此优惠引发了顾客的抗议和[法律诉讼](/wiki/Lawsuit
    "法律诉讼")，因为他们没有收到承诺的机票。此次活动对公司造成了财务灾难，并在2004年BBC纪录片播出后导致了Hoover[皇家委任状](/wiki/Royal_Warrant_of_Appointment_(United_Kingdom)
    "皇家委任状（英国）")的丧失。该公司的欧洲分部最终被其竞争对手[Candy](/wiki/Candy_(company) "Candy（公司）")收购，从未从损失、促销和随后的丑闻中恢复过来。

    "The Hoover Company") had held a 50% share of its corner of the market for almost
    40 years. In the 1980s, Hoover was owned by parent company [Maytag](/wiki/Maytag
    "Maytag") and was rapidly expanding with the potential to claim a larger share
    of a growing market. This period of expansion, however, coincided with the UK's
    entry into a major economic [recession](/wiki/Recession "Recession"), and Hoover
    was beginning to face competition from newly established British vacuum cleaner
    companies such as [Dyson](/wiki/Dyson_(company) "Dyson (company)"). From 1987
    to 1992, Hoover's profits fell from [US$](/wiki/US%24 "US$")147 million to US$74
    million, and its share of the UK vacuum-cleaning market dropped. When several
    attempts at creating novel products (such as a talking vacuum cleaner) failed
    to stimulate interest, to correct its financial trajectory, Hoover's executives
    decided to create an exciting marketing [promotion](/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)
    "Promotion (marketing)") that would encourage the public to purchase what were
    quickly becoming mounting piles of unsold products. In order to do this, Hoover
    would offer free round-trip [airline tickets](/wiki/Airline_ticket "Airline ticket")
    to the United States to individual customers who had bought at least £100 worth
    of the unsold wares.

    would also receive two round trip tickets to the United States. The promotion
    garnered a huge response from the public and Hoover was not able to keep up with

    defunct) airline company called JSI Travel, which was in a similar position: struggling
    under the weight of the recession and desperate to unload cheap flights. Hoover
