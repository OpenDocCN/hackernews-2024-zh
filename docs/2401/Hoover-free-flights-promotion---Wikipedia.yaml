- en: The **Hoover free flights promotion** was a [marketing](/wiki/Marketing "Marketing")
    [promotion](/wiki/Promotion_(marketing) "Promotion (marketing)") run by the British
    division of [the Hoover Company](/wiki/The_Hoover_Company "The Hoover Company")
    in late 1992\. The promotion, aiming to boost sales during the [global recession
    of the early 1990s](/wiki/Early_1990s_recession "Early 1990s recession"), offered
    two complimentary round-trip plane tickets to the [United States](/wiki/United_States
    "United States"), worth about [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling")600, to
    any customer purchasing at least £100 in Hoover products.^([[1]](#cite_note-thehustle-1))
    Hoover had been experiencing dwindling sales as a result of the economic downturn
    and a sharp increase in competing brands. Hoover was counting on most customers
    spending more than £100, as well as being deterred from completing the difficult
    application process, and not meeting its exact terms.

- en: Consumer response was much higher than the company anticipated, with many customers
    buying the minimum £100 of Hoover products to qualify. It was perceived as two
    US flights for just £100 with a free [vacuum cleaner](/wiki/Vacuum_cleaner "Vacuum
    cleaner") (or other product) included. The resulting demand was disastrous for
    the 84-year-old company. Hoover cancelled the ticket promotion after consumers
    had already bought the products and filled in forms applying for millions of pounds'
    worth of tickets. Reneging on the offer resulted in protests and [legal action](/wiki/Lawsuit
    "Lawsuit") from customers who failed to receive the tickets they had been promised.
    The campaign was a financial disaster for the company and led to the loss of Hoover's
    [Royal Warrant](/wiki/Royal_Warrant_of_Appointment_(United_Kingdom) "Royal Warrant
    of Appointment (United Kingdom)") after the airing of a 2004 BBC documentary.
    The European branch of the company was eventually sold to one of its competitors,
    [Candy](/wiki/Candy_(company) "Candy (company)"), having never recovered from
    the losses, the promotion and the subsequent scandal.

- en: Prior to the incident, [The Hoover appliance company](/wiki/The_Hoover_Company
    "The Hoover Company") had held a 50% share of its corner of the market for almost
    40 years. In the 1980s, Hoover was owned by parent company [Maytag](/wiki/Maytag
    "Maytag") and was rapidly expanding with the potential to claim a larger share
    of a growing market. This period of expansion, however, coincided with the UK's
    entry into a major economic [recession](/wiki/Recession "Recession"), and Hoover
    was beginning to face competition from newly established British vacuum cleaner
    companies such as [Dyson](/wiki/Dyson_(company) "Dyson (company)"). From 1987
    to 1992, Hoover's profits fell from [US$](/wiki/US%24 "US$")147 million to US$74
    million, and its share of the UK vacuum-cleaning market dropped. When several
    attempts at creating novel products (such as a talking vacuum cleaner) failed
    to stimulate interest, to correct its financial trajectory, Hoover's executives
    decided to create an exciting marketing [promotion](/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)
    "Promotion (marketing)") that would encourage the public to purchase what were
    quickly becoming mounting piles of unsold products. In order to do this, Hoover
    would offer free round-trip [airline tickets](/wiki/Airline_ticket "Airline ticket")
    to the United States to individual customers who had bought at least £100 worth
    of the unsold wares.

    who purchased a Hoover product worth at least [£](/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound
    sterling")100\. This meant that, on top of their cleaning appliance, the customer
    would also receive two round trip tickets to the United States. The promotion
    garnered a huge response from the public and Hoover was not able to keep up with
    the demand. Expecting modest engagement, Hoover had partnered with a small (now
    defunct) airline company called JSI Travel, which was in a similar position: struggling
    under the weight of the recession and desperate to unload cheap flights. Hoover
    and JSI arranged a deal in which Hoover would unload huge amounts of excess products,
    while JSI Travel would sell bulk flights to Hoover while handling bookings.'

    this promotion proved extremely popular with customers. Few customers used the
    vouchers, so in November 1992 Hoover expanded the options to include destinations
    in the United States. The addition of American locations caused a surge in consumer
    response because the airline tickets held an approximate retail value of £600
    and could apparently be obtained for an outlay of just £100\. Consumers were increasingly
    purchasing the cheapest products available to satisfy the £100 requirement, sometimes
    not returning to pick up their order. Hoover had to increase their production
    and hire new employees to meet the increased demand.^([[2]](#cite_note-chan-2))
