    stirred chaos in the 50-mile (80-kilometer) maritime route, causing a traffic
    jam of vessels, casting doubts on the canal's reliability for international shipping

    to 24, down from 38 a day in normal times last year. Vásquez added that in the
    first quarter of the fiscal year the passageway saw 20% less cargo and 791 fewer

    more “efficient” water management and a jump in rainfall in November have at least
    ensured that water levels are high enough for 24 ships to pass daily until the
    end of April, the start of the next rainy season.

    climate change, and warned it was urgent for Panama to seek new water sources
    for both the canal's operations and human consumption. The same lakes that fill
    the canal also provide water for more than 50% of the country of more than 4 million
    people.
