The Duplex watch escapement shown in the images below was invented by Robert Hooke circa 1700, then later improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, before being perfected by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782\. The Duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved higher accuracy than the Cylinder escapement, which was also a 'Frictional-rest' escapement. This meant there was additional friction compared to the lever escapements that would end up dominating future movements. It was used in English pocketwatches as the one shown here, between 1790 to 1860.
