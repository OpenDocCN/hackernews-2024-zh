- en: With the releases of iOS 16 and macOS Ventura in 2022, Apple debuted its Lockdown
    Mode for people at particular risk of being targeted by mercenary spyware. The
    feature is essentially a set of configurations for iOS and macOS that limit or
    block niceties like link previews in Messages and shared albums in Photos. Lockdown
    Mode also restricts your device's ability to accept unsolicited communications
    like FaceTime calls from phone numbers and accounts you've never called before.
    And this year, in iOS 17, Apple added additional improvements, meaning more safety-focused
    limitations. The company has consistently emphasized that Lockdown Mode is not
    meant for mainstream use by most people—but in a week of testing, it's surprisingly
    tolerable.

    your device PIN or a biometric authentication in “Privacy & Security” and then
    rebooting so the system can apply all the restrictions and limitations. Enabling
    Lockdown Mode is similar to changing the language of your device—the system needs
    to comprehensively adopt the new configuration and apply it everywhere. Once the
    reboot is complete, your device comes back on looking pretty much like normal.

    weaknesses in the complex features of iOS and macOS that facilitate communication
    and data sharing and handle different file types and information formats. So Lockdown
    Mode aims to make it much harder for commercial spyware vendors or other motivated
    and well-resourced actors to develop exploit chains that combine vulnerabilities
    in multiple iOS or macOS features to take control of devices. In practice, this
    means that it's harder and less fun to casually share—and especially receive—links,
    GIFs, and integrated elements in tools like Messages. And services like HomeKit
    are curtailed as well.

    with other apps are much less fluid. If someone sends you a payment through Apple
    Cash, you can receive it, but you'll only get a very general, unspecific message
    in Messages that something has occurred— you won't know that someone sent you
    money on Apple Cash. Links don't expand when you send and receive them, and if
    you send or receive a link to an image or other file, it will send as text-only—a
    gnarly, full URL with no preview and no hyperlink that would let you automatically
    open it in a browser.

- en: As part of Apple's most recent updates for Lockdown Mode in June, the company
    added support for Apple Watch and began automatically removing geolocation data
    from photos when you share them. The improvements also include a move to block
    devices by default from joining unsecured Wi-Fi networks and 2G cellular networks—a
    change meant to protect against malicious Wi-Fi networks and the mobile data surveillance
    tool known as [stingrays](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/hacker-lexicon-stingrays-spy-tool-government-tried-failed-hide/).

    media sharing defaults, sandboxing, and network security optimizations,” Apple
    said in a statement at the time. “Turning on Lockdown Mode further hardens device
    defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack
    surface for those who need additional protections.”
