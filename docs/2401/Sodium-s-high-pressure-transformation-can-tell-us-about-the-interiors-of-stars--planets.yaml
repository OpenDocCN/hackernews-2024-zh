- en: The mounting pressure within stars and planets can cause metals to become nonconducting
    insulators. Sodium has been shown to transform from a shiny, gray-colored metal
    into a transparent, glass-like insulator when squeezed hard enough.

    bonding behind this particular high-pressure phenomenon.

- en: While it's been theorized that high pressure essentially squeezes sodium's electrons
    out into the spaces between atoms, researchers' quantum chemical calculations
    show that these electrons still very much belong to the surrounding atoms and
    are chemically bonded to each other.

    but predicting how other elements and [chemical compounds](https://phys.org/tags/chemical+compounds/)
    behave at very high pressures will potentially give insight into bigger-picture
    questions," says Eva Zurek, Ph.D., professor of chemistry in the UB College of
    Arts and Sciences and co-author of the study, which was published in *Angewandte
    Chemie*, a journal of the German Chemical Society. "What''s the interior of a
    star like? How are planets'' magnetic fields generated, if indeed any exist? And
    how do stars and planets evolve? This type of research moves us closer to answering
    these questions."'

    physicist Neil Ashcroft, whose memory the study is dedicated to.

- en: It was once thought that materials always become metallic under high pressure—like
    the [metallic hydrogen](https://phys.org/tags/metallic+hydrogen/) theorized to
    make up Jupiter's core—but Ashcroft and Jeffrey Neaton's seminal paper two decades
    ago found some materials, like sodium, can actually become insulators or semiconductors
    when squeezed. They theorized that sodium's core electrons, thought to be inert,
    would interact with each other and the outer valence electrons when under [extreme
    pressure](https://phys.org/tags/extreme+pressure/).

    connecting it with chemical concepts of bonding," says the UB-led study''s lead
    author, Stefano Racioppi, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the UB Department
    of Chemistry.'

    so using supercomputers in UB's Center for Computational Research, the team ran
    calculations on how electrons behave in sodium atoms when under high pressure.

- en: The electrons become trapped within the interspatial regions between atoms,
    known as an electride state. This causes [sodium](https://phys.org/tags/sodium/)'s
    physical transformation from shiny metal to transparent insulator, as free-flowing
    electrons absorb and retransmit light but trapped electrons simply allow the light
    to pass through.

    of the electride state can be explained through [chemical bonding](https://phys.org/tags/chemical+bonding/).

- en: The high pressure causes electrons to occupy new orbitals within their respective
    atoms. These orbitals then overlap with each other to form [chemical bonds](https://phys.org/tags/chemical+bonds/),
    causing localized charge concentrations in the interstitial regions.

    squeezed electrons out of atoms, the new calculations found that the electrons
    are still part of surrounding atoms.

    the atoms. Instead, the electrons are shared between the atoms in a chemical bond,"
    Racioppi says. "They''re quite special."'

    of conditions."'
