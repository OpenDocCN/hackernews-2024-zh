    in designing our first consumer-facing product. [Manara](http://www.manara.tech)
    is a social impact startup whose mission is to unlock human potential and diversify
    the global tech sector while uplifting the economies of the Middle East & North
    Africa (MENA). Having proven market fit, your role as our founding designer will
    be to provide a delightful experience for the users of our training & job placement
    program and empower us to place 10x more engineers in world-class jobs. You will
    have a green field to establish our product experience, collaborating to inform
    roadmaps, new initiatives and will have a leading role in driving design direction,
    including the UX and the UI! We are an early-stage startup with a 15-person team
    which means we have a lot of leeway to shape our roles to best fit our individual
    interests.

    in the MENA region, teach them how to pass interviews, vet them, and help them
    find amazing jobs (whether remote or on-site). It works: at Google 71% of our
    referrals in our last batch were hired. We don’t stop at job placement. Our vision
    is to build the top tech talent community in the MENA region and support them
    at each stage in their lifecycle to help them reach their dreams: how to get a
    promotion, become a manager, be the first woman engineer on a team, etc. The community
    is driven by a tech product that facilitates connection, shared learning, and
    motivation.'
