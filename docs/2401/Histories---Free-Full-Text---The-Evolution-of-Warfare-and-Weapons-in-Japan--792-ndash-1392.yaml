    samurai, for whom, allegedly, the sword was his soul and hand-to-hand combat his
    trade. Yet despite the prevalence of this image, for nearly all of Japanese history,
    the premier warrior was not the swordsman but the mounted archer. Pre-conceived
    notions of what terms like “war” or “shield” or “army” or “light cavalry” and
    so forth mean can seriously hinder understanding the nature of life as a warrior
    in eighth-, tenth-, or fourteenth-century Japan and with this in mind, I will
    examine the historiography on the weapons, armor, and tactics used by Japanese
    warriors during the 600 years from 792–1392.

    Japan, and in his book Heavenly Warriors: the Evolution of Japan’s Military, 500–1300,
    he devotes considerable time and attention to analyzing the military technology
    and tactics of the day, noting when new weapons or tactics appeared and suggesting
    why. For example, he asserts that mounted archers, especially from the horse-rich
    Kanto (where they may have originally become skilled as game hunters), predominated
    in Japan until the late seventh century but were then briefly supplanted by mass
    infantry formations, some of whom were armed with crossbows.'

    foe was in a sense a kind of victory for the other side. In contrast to Farris’
    assertion that already by Masakado’s day, combat was becoming individual and ritualized,
    tenth-century warrior bands relied most heavily on the element of surprise (ambushes),
    scorched earth tactics, and night attacks (

    blindly, which he obligingly did. Friday speculates that Masakado may have stood
    in plain view with his 100 cavalry and stationed his 100–200 foot soldiers, the
    bulk of whom were surely archers, out of sight (and as we shall see, given the
    short kill range of the bow, it is hard to imagine foot archers as having any
    success at all against mounted archers unless they could conceal themselves until

    when he claimed Masakado’s army used both infantry and cavalry in mass tactics.

    hide and then fire at will when the enemy approached—and may not actually have

    in formation, nor do the numbers justify the label of “mass” tactics (

    accuracy were higher than that of the cavalry, and despite the fact that they

    was only 10 to 20 m, and the fact that right around the time of Masakado, a new
    medium-heavy type of armor, very effective at warding off arrows, had been developed,

    Even given the smaller size of Japanese combatants and the somewhat lighter armor
    and weapons, such pony-horses would tire within a few minutes if forced to gallop,

    plate armor, which may be why such heavy armor was never developed. This may be
    an instance of resource limitations constraining technological development. Yet
    even if that is the case, Japanese armor-makers adapted to the demands of the

    Crossbows might have been effective, but they had already fallen out of use, and

    other, trying to get into the optimal position (45 degrees on the left side of
    their horse’s head) to shoot at the weak spots in enemies’ armor, swooping in
    and out of kill range (20 m). Friday compares this to dog-fighting; it is also
    quite similar to naval warfare techniques like crossing the T (Ibid., pp. 73–74).

    hegemons was the quickest way to ensure a rich reward in Japan’s performance-based
    wars of the fourteenth century, there was a strong incentive to interrupt combat
    at opportune moments in order to harvest the heads of those one had killed (and
    thus to keep careful tally of individual accomplishments and performance), or
    alternatively to be seen doing something valorous by someone of importance who
    could later verify the deed. It was just such deeds as taking many heads that
    would strengthen warriors’ attempts to gain recompense for their pains. Fortunately
    for the historian, about 1300 petitions for reward (gunchūjō) submitted by autonomous
    warriors survive from the fourteenth century. Conlan conducted a statistical analysis
    of all of these documents to determine the number of named combatants, fatalities,
    and wounds and then subdivided reports of wounds by weapon, in the process revealing
    much about the nature of combat in the fourteenth century.

    This trend holds true even for cases where slain horses are mentioned; casualties

    disappeared after 1338, leading Conlan to suggest horse barding may have been

    in length yet compares them as though they were. He uses the surviving petitions
    for reward to extrapolate on the fatality rate, etc., but the sample size is small
    enough that his results might well be thrown into immediate doubt should a new
    cache of petitions come to light. Can we be sure the decline in face wounds is

    prevalence of wounds (since for slain human combatants, a specific cause of death
    is not listed in the petitions). His methodology suggests, for example, that pikes
    were barely used at all, but can we be entirely sure? Perhaps pikes were simply
    almost always fatal and thus would not show up much on charts of wounds. Such
    concerns notwithstanding, however, we can make certain tentative conclusions based
    on his statistical analysis about the popularity of weapons, correlations between
    more sword wounds and higher fatalities, and so forth.

    new weapons become popular? Some Japanese scholars have argued that the fourteenth
    century saw the rise of the pike, which put a bloody end to the dominance of cavalry
    and forced a shift back to commoner-based infantry, a picture that is perfectly
    consistent with the history of Western Europe—but not at all consistent with the
    sources in Japan. Conlan refutes this view, pointing out that there do not seem
    to have been any major tactical shifts during the fourteenth century, nor were
    pikes wielded solely by lowly commoners (

    us a general picture of the popularity of the weapons in question because, luckily,
    almost half the petitions for reward that mention wounds describe the weapon that
    dealt the blow as well. Statistically, the bow was responsible for almost 75%
    of all the wounds with named weapons over this 62-year period, with the sword
    accounting for almost 25%. But one interesting feature that emerges from this
    sort of analysis is that the period from 1333–1338 (which was responsible for
    half the wounds mentioned for the entire decades-long period) stands out for its
    greater prevalence of sword wounds (33%), thus suggesting that warfare over this
    six-year period had a greater incidence of hand-to-hand combat (which was somewhat
    more lethal than archery), whereas war afterward tended to be overwhelmingly ranged
    combat (Ibid., p. 58).

    the (weapon that was the) cause of death is not specified for warriors in these
    documents, but it seems clear from looking at these statistics, given the higher
    percentage of fatalities and sword wounds in 1333–1338 and the lower percentage
    of both in 1350–1355, that hand-to-hand combat was more lethal than arrows, and

    effectively because (among other reasons) their horses could panic after seeing
    the shadow of the blade pass them. Consequently, it seems hard to believe, as
    Conlan hazards, that mounted warriors could have been using ōdachi (great swords)
    as lances or anything at all; it seems much more likely that warriors dismounted
    almost invariably when fighting hand-to-hand. Furthermore, it is possible tentatively
    to reconstruct how swords were typically wielded by looking at the archaeological
    evidence; in the sack of Kamakura in 1333, over a hundred men, women, and children
    were killed, many of them by swords, and of this group, most wounds were to the
    forehead or the top of the head (Ibid., pp. 60–62).

    Furthermore, and perhaps for the same reason, pike wounds were rare, and by implication,
    pike use was also rare; pikes are only useful in large, disciplined companies
    of infantry in formation, something Japan appears to have completely lacked in
    the fourteenth century but was to develop in the late fifteenth and sixteenth
    centuries (Ibid., p. 63). Indeed, pikemen make little sense in an age where the
    primary offensive weapon is the mounted archer, essentially light cavalry skirmishers,
    rather than heavy cavalry. Japan had no ground-shaking mass cavalry charges; instead,
    small bands of horsemen relied on their maneuverability and marksmanship to harass

    the value of mass tactics and well-trained formations of infantry (Ibid., p. 40).
    Thereafter, in 702, the imperial court of Japan adopted the Chinese system with

    highly ritualized, a Homeric mounted archery duel between two specific combatants,
    often preceded by lengthy, boastful challenges and recitations of pedigree.

    frequent in Japan, and combat tended to become increasingly ritualized and individualized,
    until one reaches the elaborate one-on-one battles of the samurai age. Because
    of its intraspecific causes and goals, Masakado’s rebellion deserves consideration
    as Japan’s first samurai conflict.”

    useful, even though the conclusions he draws from the case of Masakado miss the
    mark entirely. It is precisely because Masakado was fighting an intraspecific
    feud, and in fact, in some ways a family conflict, that large numbers of infantry
    seem so unlikely. Rather, only those immediate family members and retainers who
    saw in his forceful protest of the court’s various decisions an opportunity for
    personal gain would ride with him. Each horseman would be accompanied by two,
    or at most three, foot soldiers, commoners who were residents of or near their
    estates, meaning they were dependents whose loyalty was often just as loose as
    their connection to the elite leader (Ibid., p. 47).

    in battle than a single infantryman. Except in a narrow numerical sense, therefore,
    it is difficult to accept Farris’ view that armies of this period were predominantly
    infantry, especially when the cavalry were master warriors and the infantry, by
    his own admission, probably did not train as a body. But most importantly of all,
    “infantry” as such did not exist; foot soldiers served as auxiliaries in mixed
    units with mounted troops and concentrated on distracting enemy cavalry (

    of vertically aligned, mostly mounted bands that had emerged in the eighth and
    ninth centuries. Moreover, these were people brought together out of common self-interest,
    not unbreakable bonds of loyalty. Foot soldiers did participate in battles, but
    not as separate troops of “infantry” since their main purpose seems to have been
    to harass the enemy’s mounted archers and keep them from being able to focus entirely
    on their own mounted warriors. Furthermore, what foot soldiers there were had
    less to gain by fighting since (nameless as they were) no glory would accrue to
    them even if they fought bravely, and they could hold out no hope of a formal
    reward since they were not of sufficient status to request one. Even when the
    Shōmonki lauds Masakado’s foot soldier forces for saving the day in one battle
    in 936, no mention is made of individuals or of any rewards (Ibid., p. 55).

    the Shōmonki does credit Masakado’s un-mounted soldiers with his victory against
    a numerically superior force, though as usual, no numbers are given for the size
    of his infantry contingent. His cavalry is declared to be over one hundred men,
    and given the typical ratio of mounted to un-mounted, he may have had up to two
    hundred foot soldiers with him, though not all of them were necessarily involved
    directly in the fighting (Ibid., pp. 54–55). But foot soldiers were incorporated
    into mixed units, so it is hard to see in the age of Masakado any remnants at
    all of the large infantry-based Taihō armies.

    as to why I chose this particular 600-year range for my analysis. Just as the
    first date, 792, may initially have seemed a strange beginning point for a discussion
    of war, so too the second, 1392, might strike many as odd, especially considering
    the desultory nature of fighting between the two courts by this late date. However,
    one key goal of this essay was to determine the degree of continuity within this
    600-year period and the degree of change. How, then, did the composition of armies
    and the motivations of soldiers change over the 600 years from the end of conscription
    to 1392?

    squabbles of the previous centuries. It was the invasion of a foreign enemy, yet

    in the quarrel would have his lands confiscated and given to the victor. However,
    the conflict with the Mongols did not free up any new land, making reward-giving
    extremely problematic. Nevertheless, it would seem Japanese soldiers did not voluntarily
    forego the chance at reward; instead, they demanded it, indicating quite clearly
    that in the late thirteenth century, the main motivation of high-ranking soldiers
    remained self-interest (

    or military government), were what Farris might call “predatory” in that an external
    political organization, the bakufu, was targeted for elimination, making the us-them
    distinction relatively clear. Starting in 1339, however, combat in the fourteenth
    century became more often intraspecific, in which combatants were primarily fighting
    not to defeat an external other but rather approached armed conflict as a sort
    of forceful negotiation for status, lands, and other rewards, fully aware of the
    competitive opportunities available thanks to the two courts. In such a state
    of affairs, one would have no compunction calling most of the warrior bands unabashed
    mercenaries, which might go a long way toward explaining the more lackluster fatality
    rate in combat between the factions after 1338, as well as the constantly shifting
    allegiances and jockeying for position during the period, as the two courts bargained
    to gain new allies and retain existing ones.
