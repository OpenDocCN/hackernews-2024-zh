- en: One of the most enduring images of pre-modern Japan is that of the fearsome
    samurai, for whom, allegedly, the sword was his soul and hand-to-hand combat his
    trade. Yet despite the prevalence of this image, for nearly all of Japanese history,
    the premier warrior was not the swordsman but the mounted archer. Pre-conceived
    notions of what terms like “war” or “shield” or “army” or “light cavalry” and
    so forth mean can seriously hinder understanding the nature of life as a warrior
    in eighth-, tenth-, or fourteenth-century Japan and with this in mind, I will
    examine the historiography on the weapons, armor, and tactics used by Japanese
    warriors during the 600 years from 792–1392.

    assertion that already by Masakado’s day, combat was becoming individual and ritualized,
    tenth-century warrior bands relied most heavily on the element of surprise (ambushes),

    flags. He divides the 62-year period into four sub-periods that are not equal
    in length yet compares them as though they were. He uses the surviving petitions
    for reward to extrapolate on the fatality rate, etc., but the sample size is small
    enough that his results might well be thrown into immediate doubt should a new
    cache of petitions come to light. Can we be sure the decline in face wounds is
    really from the hōate and not merely a statistical anomaly due (though naturally
    not out of choice) to a small sample size?

- en: Similarly, Conlan judges how widely used each type of weapon was based on the
    prevalence of wounds (since for slain human combatants, a specific cause of death
    is not listed in the petitions). His methodology suggests, for example, that pikes
    were barely used at all, but can we be entirely sure? Perhaps pikes were simply
    almost always fatal and thus would not show up much on charts of wounds. Such
    concerns notwithstanding, however, we can make certain tentative conclusions based
    on his statistical analysis about the popularity of weapons, correlations between
    more sword wounds and higher fatalities, and so forth.

    wars of the fourteenth century? Were they the same as those of the tenth, or had
    new weapons become popular? Some Japanese scholars have argued that the fourteenth
    century saw the rise of the pike, which put a bloody end to the dominance of cavalry
    and forced a shift back to commoner-based infantry, a picture that is perfectly
    consistent with the history of Western Europe—but not at all consistent with the
    sources in Japan. Conlan refutes this view, pointing out that there do not seem
    to have been any major tactical shifts during the fourteenth century, nor were
    pikes wielded solely by lowly commoners (

    us a general picture of the popularity of the weapons in question because, luckily,
    almost half the petitions for reward that mention wounds describe the weapon that
    dealt the blow as well. Statistically, the bow was responsible for almost 75%
    of all the wounds with named weapons over this 62-year period, with the sword
    accounting for almost 25%. But one interesting feature that emerges from this
    sort of analysis is that the period from 1333–1338 (which was responsible for
    half the wounds mentioned for the entire decades-long period) stands out for its
    greater prevalence of sword wounds (33%), thus suggesting that warfare over this
    six-year period had a greater incidence of hand-to-hand combat (which was somewhat
    more lethal than archery), whereas war afterward tended to be overwhelmingly ranged
    combat (Ibid., p. 58).

    effectively because (among other reasons) their horses could panic after seeing
    the shadow of the blade pass them. Consequently, it seems hard to believe, as
    Conlan hazards, that mounted warriors could have been using ōdachi (great swords)
    as lances or anything at all; it seems much more likely that warriors dismounted
    almost invariably when fighting hand-to-hand. Furthermore, it is possible tentatively
    to reconstruct how swords were typically wielded by looking at the archaeological
    evidence; in the sack of Kamakura in 1333, over a hundred men, women, and children
    were killed, many of them by swords, and of this group, most wounds were to the
    forehead or the top of the head (Ibid., pp. 60–62).

    axes and halberds (naginata) had a major weakness: their wooden handles. Slash

    Furthermore, and perhaps for the same reason, pike wounds were rare, and by implication,
    pike use was also rare; pikes are only useful in large, disciplined companies
    of infantry in formation, something Japan appears to have completely lacked in
    the fourteenth century but was to develop in the late fifteenth and sixteenth
    centuries (Ibid., p. 63). Indeed, pikemen make little sense in an age where the
    primary offensive weapon is the mounted archer, essentially light cavalry skirmishers,
    rather than heavy cavalry. Japan had no ground-shaking mass cavalry charges; instead,
    small bands of horsemen relied on their maneuverability and marksmanship to harass

- en: The initial wars of the 1330s, seeking to topple the Kamakura bakufu (“tent”
    or military government), were what Farris might call “predatory” in that an external
    political organization, the bakufu, was targeted for elimination, making the us-them
    distinction relatively clear. Starting in 1339, however, combat in the fourteenth
    century became more often intraspecific, in which combatants were primarily fighting
    not to defeat an external other but rather approached armed conflict as a sort
    of forceful negotiation for status, lands, and other rewards, fully aware of the
    competitive opportunities available thanks to the two courts. In such a state
    of affairs, one would have no compunction calling most of the warrior bands unabashed
    mercenaries, which might go a long way toward explaining the more lackluster fatality
    rate in combat between the factions after 1338, as well as the constantly shifting
    allegiances and jockeying for position during the period, as the two courts bargained
    to gain new allies and retain existing ones.

  zh: 1330年代初期的战争，旨在推翻鎌倉幕府（“帐篷”或军事政府），正如法里斯所称的那样，“掠夺性”的，因为一个外部政治组织，幕府，被视为目标而被清除，使得我们与他们的区别相对清晰。然而，从1339年开始，十四世纪的战斗更多地变成了内部的，其中战斗者主要不是为了击败外部的其他人，而是将武装冲突视为一种寻求地位、土地和其他奖励的强制性谈判，充分意识到由于两个朝廷提供的竞争机会而存在的竞争机会。在这种情况下，人们对大多数武装团体毫不犹豫地称之为彻头彻尾的雇佣兵，这或许在解释1338年后派系之间战斗中较为平淡的死亡率，以及在这一时期不断变化的盟友关系和地位争夺中，两个朝廷为了获得新的盟友和保留现有盟友而进行的讨价还价方面可以说明得很清楚。

    arisen: one founded not on familial or mercenary ties but on regional loyalty.
    This new phenomenon of large, relatively loyal, regional forces heralded the coming
    of chaos: the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and the ensuing Warring States Period. Yet
    the critical change had occurred in the late fourteenth century and was complete
    by 1392: the warrior’s relationship to society and his motivations had altered,
