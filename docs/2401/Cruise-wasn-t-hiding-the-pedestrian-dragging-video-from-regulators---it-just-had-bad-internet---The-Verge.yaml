- en: Cruise, the self-driving car subsidiary of General Motors, tried to send a 45-second
    video to regulators of an incident in which one of its driverless cars dragged
    a pedestrian 20 feet but was hampered by “internet connectivity issues,” according
    to a report compiled by a law firm investigating the incident.

- en: The law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, was hired by Cruise to determine
    whether its executives misled regulators in the aftermath of the [October 2nd
    incident](/2023/10/3/23901233/cruise-crash-hit-run-pedestrian-injury-sf-robotaxi)
    in which a hit-and-run driver struck a pedestrian, knocking her into the path
    of a driverless Cruise vehicle. Its conclusions were detailed in [a nearly 200-page
    report](https://assets.ctfassets.net/95kuvdv8zn1v/1mb55pLYkkXVn0nXxEXz7w/9fb0e4938a89dc5cc09bf39e86ce5b9c/2024.01.24_Quinn_Emanuel_Report_re_Cruise.pdf)
    that was released today.

    Cruise’s license](/2023/10/24/23930629/california-dmv-suspends-cruise-robotaxi-permit-safety) to
    operate its vehicles in the state. The department also accused the company of
    withholding portions of the video of the incident that showed its vehicle dragging
    the pedestrian to the curb in an attempt to pull over. Cruise denies the allegation,
    claiming it showed the agency the whole video.

- en: The law firm’s report appears to support both claims. The firm concludes that
    “the weight of the evidence” confirms that Cruise “played or attempted to play
    the Full Video” depicting its car dragging the woman to the curb in its October
    3rd briefing with regulators and other government officials.

    or hampered them from seeing the Full Video clearly and fully,” the report states.
    “And Cruise failed to augment the Full Video by affirmatively pointing out the
    pullover maneuver and dragging of the pedestrian.”

    to the October 3rd meeting with the San Francisco mayor’s office, the National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the DMV, and other government officials.
    But Cruise said nothing about the pedestrian being dragged, instead “letting the
    video speak for itself.” A bad internet connection prevented that from happening.

- en: In the immediate hours after the incident, some Cruise employees were unaware
    that the vehicle dragged the pedestrian while attempting to pull over and issued
    a press statement and began sharing an early video with journalists. But after
    becoming aware, Cruise failed to update its statement or share the full video
    of the incident.

- en: Likewise, Cruise’s leadership was “fixated” on correcting the media narrative
    that the Cruise vehicle, and not the hit-and-run driver, had caused the accident.
    This “myopic focus” led the company to omit details about the role its own vehicle
    played in injuring the pedestrian. Cruise’s failure to correct the record led
    regulators and the media to accuse the company of misleading them, the firm states.

  zh: 同样，Cruise的领导层“专注于”纠正媒体对Cruise车辆而非肇事逃逸驾驶员造成事故的叙述。这种“近视焦点”导致公司忽略了其自身车辆在伤害行人方面发挥的作用的细节。该公司未能纠正记录导致监管机构和媒体指责该公司误导他们。
- en: Largely, a culture of antagonism toward regulators at Cruise helped contribute
    to these failings. In its interviews with employees, Cruise “observed too much
    of an ‘us versus them’ attitude... which is not indicative of a healthy, mutually
    productive relationship,” says the Quinn Emanuel report.

  zh: 在很大程度上，Cruise对监管机构存在对抗文化有助于造成这些失误。在与员工的面谈中，Cruise“观察到了过多的‘我们对抗他们’的态度......这并不表明健康、相互有益的关系”，Quinn
    Emanuel报告称。
- en: The firm says it is a “fundamentally flawed approach” to assume a video can
    “speak for itself” and remove the need to disclose all details to regulators and
    government officials. “As one Cruise employee stated in a text message to another
    employee about this matter, our ‘leaders have failed us,’” the report states.
