["```\nWe now use ROWHAMMER-resistent values for ALLOW, DENY, AUTH_SUCCESS,\nAUTH_FAILURE, AUTH_ERROR and AUTH_NONINTERACTIVE.  In addition, we\nexplicitly test for expected values instead of using a negated test\nagainst an error value.  In the parser match functions this means\nexplicitly checking for ALLOW or DENY instead of accepting anything\nthat is not set to UNSPEC.\n\nThanks to Andrew J. Adiletta, M.
