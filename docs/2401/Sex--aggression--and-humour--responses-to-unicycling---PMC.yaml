- en: After retiring from a busy university department in Newcastle upon Tyne, and
    with the time and the need for more than the usual consultancies, I was able follow
    some of my more extreme inclinations. As a cyclist, I had occasionally thought
    of using more or fewer wheels, but it was only when choosing a grandson’s gift
    that I got seriously lost in contemplation of a gleaming chrome unicycle. My wife
    said “buy the bloody” thing, which I did on the whim of the moment. After months
    of practice at home, I graduated to back streets, a small paved park, and finally
    town roads. I couldn’t avoid being noticed; in turn, I couldn’t avoid observing
    the form that notice took. Because at the time there were no other unicyclists
    in the area, such sightings would have been exceptional, yet I soon found that
    the responses to them were stereotyped and predictable. I realised that this indicated
    an underlying biological phenomenon and set about its study.

- en: As I had no idea what the phenomenon was, my reservoir of multipurpose preconceptions
    could not provide a testable hypothesis; instead, I needed simply to observe neutrally
    the response to the unusual stimulus of unicycling administered reproducibly.
    I therefore wore the same bland tracksuit, trainers, and facial demeanour, and
    I rode “neutrally” with no attempt to entertain.

    and those who made them (estimated age; relationships; and class from dress, speech,
    and behaviour) as soon as possible. Subsequently, I only recorded new responses
    or significant variants. I collected written recordings from more than 400 people.

- en: Almost 50% of those encountered, more often men than women, responded verbally
    (box). The sex difference in the type of response was striking. Around 95% of
    responses from women praised, encouraged, or showed concern, and women made few
    comic or snide remarks. In contrast, only 25% of the comments made by men indicated
    praise, appreciation, or neutrality, whereas 75% were attempts at comedy, often
    snide and proffered combatively as a put-down. Equally striking was their repetitive
    nature, even though given as if original—almost 66% of these “comic” responses
    referred to the number of wheels (the most common), the absence of handlebars,
    or a part having being lost or stolen (box). Less than 25% used less obvious snide
    humour, but often with stylistic repetition. Some remarks were fired off as if
    they had been rehearsed on approach. More often, people paused briefly while trying
    to formulate the response, which was sometimes delivered after I had passed. This
    pause to find a comic phrase contrasted with the immediacy and apparent spontaneity
    of the few laudatory remarks made by men and the many made by women. Some of the
    remarks showed combativeness and envy, such as “bet I could do better than that.”

- en: Young children usually showed curiosity, and drew their parents’ attention to
    the unicycle as often as the converse. Parental comments showed a sex difference—fathers’
    remarks were either typical male (wheels, etc) or practical (maintaining balance,
    etc), whereas mothers’ comments praised and usually informed the children.

- en: From about 11-13 years, boys began to develop an aggressive response, which
    continued throughout the school years. They tried to put me off balance by suddenly
    shouting, jumping out of hiding, kicking a football, throwing stones, or riding
    a bicycle at me; a few asked for a ride in addition to aggressive behaviour.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A further change in male behaviour was seen during the late teens—aggression
    decreased, but they tried to make disparaging “jokes,” which were sometimes incorporated
    into mocking songs. This change continued, and finally evolved into adult male
    humour with its concealed aggression.

- en: The female response was subdued during puberty and late teens, with apparent
    indifference or minimal approval, such as a tentative smile. It then evolved to
    the laudatory and concerned adult female response. Rarely, a male “joke” was made
    by girls in male company.

    Asian people encountered gave more approving and fewer comic responses. The response
    of people in cars was remarkable. Young men in old cars were very aggressive,
    acting as if to frighten me off the road—they lowered their windows and shouted
    abusively, waved their arms, and hooted. I did not see this with women drivers
    and older men in more expensive cars.

- en: This study observed the response to a sudden, unexpected exposure to a new phenomenon—unicycling.
    The response to this stimulus was surprisingly consistent but varied with age,
    sex, and stage of sexual development. Young children were curious, but as boys
    grew older their response became physically and verbally aggressive. As boys matured
    to men their response became more verbal and evolved into the concealed aggression
    of a humorous verbal put-down, which was lost with age. In contrast, the female
    response was praise and concern for safety.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A strength of the study was that it involved the observation of an unexpected,
    spontaneous response, not a planned test of a preconception. Possible limitations
    are that the stimulus may have varied despite attempted consistency; but the main
    reservation is that because responses were not from a consecutive cohort or sample,
    the findings are only semi-quantitative. Fortunately, the differences found were
    large enough to overcome this; likewise the subjective assessments of relationships,
    age, and social class. Unicycles take one wheel and one person; confirmation by
    another rider, with a different style, appearance, dress, age, sex, and location
    is desirable, but the observed responses are still relevant to the situation studied
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Biological systems are often best defined by stimulation—for example, the heart
    by exercise—but conscious modification makes this less reliable for mental responses.
    Sudden exposure to a novel stimulus lessens the opportunity for this, and the
    unprepared response is more likely to reflect an underlying attitude. Opportunistic
    use of unicycling in this way was validated by the consistency of the response
    to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The physical responses corresponded to the verbal ones, and added little to
    them. Most men clearly meant their responses to be funny and snide, and they were
    often given as a put-down. Women, however, usually responded with pleasure and
    admiration and were concerned about safety. The consistent content of the male
    “joke” and its triumphant delivery as if it was original and funny, even when
    it was neither, was remarkable, and it suggests a common underlying mechanism.
    The evolution of the response provides the clue to what this might be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Children showed curiosity and interest, which changed in young boys. In older
    boys, curiosity was replaced by minor physical and verbal aggression—attempts
    to topple the unicycle coupled with first attempts at simple, mocking humour.
    In teenage boys, the physical aggression was replaced by verbally aggressive mockery,
    with elements of adult humour. This response “matured” to its adult male form
    as a mocking joke, which partly disguised its aggressive origins, an origin that
    was again revealed by the gross response of motorists, in whom aggressive behaviour
    is often exacerbated. This adult stage corresponded to the peak of virility and
    ameliorated in older men, who were more neutral and amicable, with few attempts
    at a jovial put-down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea that unicycling is intrinsically funny cannot explain the findings—particularly
    their repetitiveness, evolution, and sex differences—and the notion that males
    are just expressing a greater sense of humour simply restates an observational
    fact. Social and ethnic differences seemed to soften the male response, and such
    a softening was also noted when unicycling in Framlingham, a small Suffolk town
    to which I had moved from Newcastle. A genetic effect would explain the sex difference,
    but not the waxing and waning of the male response—the simplest and most direct
    explanation is androgen induced virility. Such a causal association fits well
    with the observed evolution to aggression, an attribute related to androgens (figure[f1]),
    but direct endocrine confirmation would require studies not available to a unicyclist.
    The observed aggression could be a male response to confrontation, a situation
    where competition and combativeness are never far away. The male response to female
    unicyclists has yet to be studied, but the results of inquiries to unicyclists
    in other regions and countries suggest that the same jokes about wheels predominate.

- en: Particularly interesting for the evolution of humour was the way the initial
    aggressive intent channelled the verbal response into a contrived but more subtle
    and sophisticated joke, in which aggression is concealed by wit. This shows how
    the aggression that leads to humour eventually becomes separated from it as wit,
    jokes, and other comic forms, which then take on an independent life of their
    own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These observations lead to the conclusion that humour evolves from androgen
    primed aggression. But can that conclusion be generalised? Repartee and banter
    have many of the characteristics of controlled aggression—so often revealed when
    control is lost—and it may be no coincidence that quick wit is likened to a rapier.
    The findings may also be relevant to the great male-female divide in humour—women
    tell fewer jokes than men and most comedians are men, despite some notable exceptions.
    The findings also suggest that the difference is sexual rather than social. I
    will not generalise into the many writings on humour—too many of which take an
    armchair view of the bedroom—from Freud on male humour as an aggressive response
    to women to the priapic interpretations of Roman sculptures and the effect of
    salacious comic cartoons on subsequent aggressive behaviour. The range of theoretical
    options on offer is too great and unproved for interpreting or extending a simple
    experimental study such as the response to unicycling.

- en: The existence of an overwhelming sex difference inevitably raises the possibility
    of biological advantage, in particular whether male humour enhances female sexual
    preference. Marty Feldman, a notoriously unprepossessing comic, had no doubt of
    it, and Diane Keaton said she was mostly won over by men who made her laugh. Darwin’s
    *Descent of Man* defined the dominant evolutionary role of sexual selection.^([1](#ref1))
    The components of mate attraction are becoming defined^([2](#ref2))—the male woos
    and the female selects—and male humour seems to be involved.^([3](#ref3)) The
    present finding that humour may reflect androgen induced aggression could provide
    a Darwinian explanation both of its attraction and its continued use as a sexually
    useful tool.

    form from which the male develops. Could it be that without androgens the human
    response would be female, with its favourable, warm, tolerant concern? Perhaps
    male aggression is too high a price for humour.

- en: The response to the unexpected and novel stimulus of seeing a unicyclist was
    surprisingly consistent even to the words and gestures used, and these varied
    with age, sex, and stage of sexual development. In males the response moved from
    curiosity in childhood, to physical and verbal aggression in older boys; this
    became more verbal as the boys matured into men and evolved into the concealed
    aggression of a repetitive humorous verbal put-down, which was lost with age.
    In contrast, the female response was praise and concern for safety. These findings
    suggest that humour develops from aggression in response to male hormones.
