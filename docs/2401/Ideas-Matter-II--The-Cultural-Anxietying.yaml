    I argued that we are living in an increasingly risk-averse, techno-pessimistic
    and overly cautious culture. We might call this a “Cultural Anxietying”. Data
    journalist [John Burn-Murdoch](https://www.ft.com/john-burn-murdoch) from the
    Financial Times cites my piece in his latest column, in which he also brings some
    new quantitative evidence for the existence of this culture:'

    the nexus of science, economics and policy, argues that the growing scepticism
    around technology and the rise in zero-sum thinking in modern society is one of
    the defining ideological challenges of our time."'

    head in a range of situations: from interpersonal relationships to worsening outcomes
    in teenage mental health. These are the kind of consequences that psychologists
    like [Jonathan Haidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt) or [Jean Twenge](https://www.jeantwenge.com/)
    have been particularly focused on. As a Genomicist, I''m increasingly worried
    about how this cautious mindset could hinder scientific progress. In my observation,
    both Millennials and my own generation (Zoomers) display a lukewarm excitement
    about technological advances. I believe it''s crucial to emphasize practical,
    scientific solutions in crucial areas ranging from healthcare to climate change.
    Surprisingly, such solutions aren''t just unfashionable to talk about; they''re
    sometimes actively opposed, frequently citing safety concerns. A prime example
    is the opposition to nuclear energy.'

- en: I have been aware for a time about the hypothesis that the Industrial Revolution
    in Europe, particularly in Britain, was significantly influenced by a "culture
    of progress" – a collective mindset valuing scientific knowledge and technological
    innovation, which was nurtured by intellectuals and effectively disseminated to
    skilled craftsmen. This cultural shift played a crucial role in fostering industrial
    advancements, diverging from traditional theories that focused mainly on economic
    and material conditions. What drove me to focus my attention on this topic NOW
    is recent evidence from a [paper](https://docs.iza.org/dp16674.pdf) using topic
    analysis on a vast array of English texts from 1500 to 1900\. This work demonstrates
    a notable increase in progress-oriented language, especially in works at the intersection
    of political economy and science, indicating a widespread cultural embrace of
    progress that correlates with the period of Industrialization. If we accept that
    our cultural attitudes towards progress do actually have a material impact, I
    argue that the cultural trend towards risk aversion and techno-pessimism does
    not bode well for the future.

    nature. It was the result of a disorganised and non-coordinated process of perusing
    top publications and talking to students at elite universities. But the only piece
    of quantitative evidence I had was some work on the rise of zero-sum thinking
    among Millennials. In today’s [edition](https://www.ft.com/content/e577411e-3bf2-4fb4-872a-8b7d5e9139d3)

    progress, and towards one of caution, worry and risk-aversion, with economic growth
    slowing over the same period. The frequency of terms related to progress, improvement
    and the future has dropped by about 25 per cent since the 1960s, while those related
    to threats, risks and worries have become several times more common.”

    on her Deathbed.'' There’s a striking contrast between the opulence of the bed
    and her physical deterioration. While she lies amidst luxury, her life ebbs away
    in her youth. This image serves as a metaphor for our civilisation: if we succumb
    to a state of paralysis, engulfed by fear and apprehension, our fate might mirror
    hers, surrounded by comfort yet diminishing at our peak'
