Today Blender turns 30 years old! To celebrate this milestone, Blender Foundation organized a donation drive during the month of December 2023\. The theme was “a gift for Blender”, inviting everyone to contribute with a gift, no matter big or small, to show support for the project and to ensure its independence as it keeps growing up.

The campaign was a success, with over 10000 gifts, evenly divided between one-time donations and Development Fund memberships, raising over 200k EUR in one month. Thank you to everyone who donated!

While this has been an amazing journey, there’s no point in stopping to reminisce on each step of the way. To express this feeling, the team has put together a little video.

Here’s to the next 30 years!
