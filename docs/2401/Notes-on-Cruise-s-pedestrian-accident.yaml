- en: This is a set of notes on the Quinn Emanuel report on Cruise's handling of the
    2023-10-02 accident where a Cruise autonomous vehicle (AV) hit a pedestrian, stopped,
    and then started moving again with the pedestrian stuck under the bottom of the
    AV, dragging the pedestrian 20 feet. After seeing some comments about this report,
    I read five stories on this report and then skimmed the report and my feeling
    is that the authors of four of the stories probably didn't read the report, and
    that people who were commenting had generally read stories by journalists who
    did not appear to read the source material, so the comments were generally way
    off base. [As we previously discussed, it's common for summaries to be wildly
    wrong, even when they're summarizing a short paper that's easily read by laypeople](/dunning-kruger/),
    so of course summaries of a 200-page report are likely to be misleading at best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On reading the entire report, I'd say that Cruise both looks better and worse
    than in the articles I saw, which is the same pattern we saw when we looked at
    the actual source for [Exhibits H and J from Twitter v. Musk](/elon-twitter-texts/),
    the [United States v. Microsoft Corp. docs](/us-v-ms/), etc.; just as some journalists
    seem to be pro/anti-Elon Musk and pro/anti-Microsoft, willing to push an inaccurate
    narrative to dunk on them to the maximum extent possible or exonerate them to
    the maximum extent possible, we see the same thing here with Cruise. And as we
    saw in those cases, despite some articles seemingly trying to paint Cruise in
    the best or worst light possible, the report itself has material that is more
    positive and more negative than we see in the most positive or negative stories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Aside from correcting misleading opinions on the report, I find the report interesting
    because it's rare to see any kind of investigation over what went wrong in tech
    in this level of detail, let alone a public one. We often see this kind of investigation
    in safety critical systems and sometimes see in sports as well as for historical
    events, but tech events are usually not covered like this. Of course companies
    do post-mortems of incidents, but you generally won't see a 200-page report on
    a single incident, nor will the focus of post-mortems be what the focus was here.
    In the past, [we've noted that a lot can be learned by looking at the literature
    and incident reports on safety-critical systems](/wat/), so of course this is
    true here as well, where we see a safety-critical system that's more tech adjacent
    than the ones we've looked at previously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The length and depth of the report here reflects a difference in culture between
    safety-critical systems and "tech". The behavior that's described as unconscionable
    in the report is not only normal in tech, but probably more transparent and above
    board than you'd see at most major tech companies; I find the culture clash between
    tech and safety-critical systems interesting as well. I attempted to inject as
    little of my opinion as possible into the report as possible, even in cases where
    knowledge of tech companies or engineering meant that I would've personally written
    something different. For more opinions, [see the section at the end](#back-to-danluu-com).

    video that gets released if one is released". Video is a single pane from left-front
    of AV and only shows Nissan hitting pedestrian. Estrada says this should be shown
    in meetings with regulators first to show "what happened in clarity so you can
    see how the event happened (establish clear fault of human driver)", but "no evidence
    this shorter 4-second video was shown at any of the regulatory meetings."'

    "A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode,
    was at a complete stop in response to a red light on southbound Cyril Magnin Street
    at the intersection with Market Street. A dark colored Nissan Sentra was also
    stopped in the adjacent lane to the left of the AV. As the Nissan Sentra and the
    AV proceeded through the intersection after the light turned green, a pedestrian
    entered the crosswalk on the opposite side of Market Street across from the vehicles
    and proceeded through the intersection against a red light. The pedestrian passed
    through the AV''s lane of travel but stopped mid-crosswalk in the adjacent lane.
    Shortly thereafter, the Nissan Sentra made contact with the pedestrian, launching

    mostly redacted, although there is a lot of interesting non-redacted content,
    such as "the collision detection system incorrectly identified the pedestrian
    as being located on the side of the AV at the time of impact instead of in front
    of the AV and thus determined the collision to be a side impact ... The determination
    by the ADS that a side collision occurred, and not a frontal collision, led to
    a less severe collision response being executed and resulted in the AV performing
    the subsequent outermost lane stop maneuver instead of an emergency stop ... The
    root cause of the AV’s post-collision movement, after the initial brief stop,
    was the inaccurate determination by the ADS that a side collision had occurred
    ... the inaccuracy of the object track considered by the collision detection system
    and the resulting disparity between this track and the pedestrian’s actual position,
    the ADS failed to accurately determine the location of the pedestrian at the time
    of impact and while the pedestrian was underneath the vehicle"

    if you have to handle the many small ones. You get terrible at incidents if you

    case, but is something I've wondered about for a while, is why the AVs that I
    see driving don't have upgraded tires and brakes. You can get much shorter stopping
    distances from cars that aren't super heavy by upgrading their tires and brakes,
    but the AVs I've seen have not had this done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, we can't do the exact comparison from an upgraded vehicle to the
    base vehicle because the vehicle dynamics data was redacted from section 3.3.3,
    table 9, and figure 40 of the appendix, but it's common knowledge that the simplest
    safety upgrade you can make on a car is upgrading the tires (and, if relevant,
    the brakes). One could argue that this isn't worth the extra running cost, or
    the effort (for the low-performance cars that I tend to see converted into AVs,
    getting stopping distances equivalent to a sporty vehicle would generally require
    modifying the wheel well so that wider tires don't rub) but, as an outsider, I'd
    be curious to know what the cost benefit trade-off on shorter stopping distances
    is.

- en: Looking at actual accelerometer data from a car with upgraded tires and brakes,
    stopping time from `19.1mph` for that car was around `0.8s`, so this wouldn't
    have made much difference in this case. If brakes aren't pre-charged before attempting
    to brake, there's significant latency when initially braking, such that `0.25s`
    isn't enough for almost any braking to have occurred, which we can see from the
    speed only being `0.5mph` slower in this case.
  prefs: []

- en: Another comment from the exec is that, while a human might react to the collision
    at `-2.9s` and slow down or stop, "scene understanding" as a human might do it
    is non-existent in most or perhaps all AVs, so it's unsurprising that the AV doesn't
    react until the pedestrian is in the AV's path, whereas a human, if they noticed
    the accident in the adjacent lane, would likely drastically slow down or stop
    (the exec guessed that most humans would come to a complete stop, whereas I guessed
    that most humans would slow down). The exec was also not surprised by the `530ms`
    latency between the pedestrian landing in the AV's path and the AV starting to
    attempt to apply the brakes although, as a lay person, I found `530ms` surprising.
