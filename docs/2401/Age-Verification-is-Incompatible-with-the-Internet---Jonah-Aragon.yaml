- en: The recent move among U.S. states to add digital "age verification" to websites
    which serve adult content is a troubling one. Digital age verification systems
    are rife with privacy concerns, many requiring you to upload your government ID
    to third-party vendors or even directly to the website in question. Privacy advocates
    and companies within the industry have correctly identified all sorts of problems
    with the idea of tying your personal identity to your browsing activity.

  zh: 美国各州最近开始向提供成人内容的网站添加数字“年龄验证”，这是一个令人担忧的举动。数字年龄验证系统存在着隐私问题，许多系统要求你将政府身份证件上传给第三方供应商，甚至直接上传到相关网站。隐私倡导者和该行业内的公司已经正确地指出，将个人身份与浏览活动相关联存在各种问题。

    uploading Personally Identifying Information (PII) to every site which requires
    verification. This is the opposite of [privacy-by-design](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/?ref=jonaharagon.com),
    and will only have the effect of making the internet a much less private, more
    dangerous place. A system where you have to transmit your PII online *at all*
    also creates a substantial risk of identity theft. We live in a world where even

    and some security experts are proponents of so-called "device-based age verification."
    This is a system where your age will be independently verified by your phone's

    would then share that verification status with websites, instead of making each
    site perform that verification independently.

- en: Doing this in a "zero-knowledge" fashion is not impossible. It would be relatively
    easy to devise a solution in which your phone verifies your age with your local
    government, and acts as a middleman to share a de-identified verification with
    the sites you visit. The website would only have the knowledge that your age was
    verified, without having to receive a plethora of other information such as your
    exact age, name, address, etc. Your government would receive no knowledge about
    what websites you visit either, only that your digital ID was linked to some device.
