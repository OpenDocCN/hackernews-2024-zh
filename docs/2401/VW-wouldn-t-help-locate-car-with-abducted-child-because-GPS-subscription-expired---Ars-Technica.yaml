- en: A sheriff's office in Illinois said it was initially thwarted from tracking
    a stolen car with a 2-year-old boy inside when Volkswagen's Car-Net service refused
    to provide access to the tracking system because the car's subscription had expired.

    immediately called Volkswagen Car-Net, in an attempt to track the vehicle," the
    Lake County sheriff''s office said in a [statement posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LakeCoILSheriff/posts/pfbid0BkG4cQSwBFyeQ4LJprSWcRi6YVgtEk1viJfS4587qQWNfX6dzBHbo1mX8icgTxYul)
    about the incident on February 23\. "Unfortunately, there was a delay, as Volkswagen
    Car-Net would not track the vehicle with the abducted child until they received
    payment to reactivate the tracking device in the stolen Volkswagen."'

    it had already been located by other means. "About 30 minutes had passed, and
    'we had already located the 2-year-old child and located the vehicle before they
    even provided us the information, so it was at that point worthless,' Covelli
