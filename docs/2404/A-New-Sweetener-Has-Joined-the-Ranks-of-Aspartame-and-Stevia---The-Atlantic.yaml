    green-lighted by the FDA last month. Oobli, a California-based company that sells
    the lemonade-iced tea and manufactures brazzein (which occurs naturally in West
    Africa’s oubli fruit), has billed it as a “revolution in sweetness.” Yet like
    everything that came before it, brazzein is far from perfect: To help mask its
    off taste, the can had some real sugar in it too. For now, Eric Walters, a sweetener

    FDA 批准的糖替代品。Oobli 是一家总部位于加利福尼亚的公司，销售柠檬茶和柠檬水，并生产 brazzein（这种物质自然存在于西非的 oubli 果实中），他们将其宣传为“甜味革命”。然而，就像之前所有的甜味剂一样，brazzein
    远非完美：为了掩盖其异味，罐子里也添加了一些真正的糖。目前，Rosalind Franklin 大学的甜味剂专家 Eric Walters 告诉我，brazzein
    只是“现有众多选择的一种替代品”。迄今为止，没有一种甜味剂能接近真正的甜味。
- en: 'The ideal sugar alternative is more than just sweet. It must also be safe,
    taste good, and replicate the distinct way sugar’s sweetness develops on the tongue.
    In addition to aspartame and other synthetic sugar alternatives that have existed
    for more than a century, the past two decades have brought “natural” ones that
    are plant-derived: sweeteners made with stevia or monk fruit, which the FDA first
    approved in 2008 and 2010, respectively, can now be readily found in beverages
    such as Truly hard seltzer and Fairlife protein shakes. Stevia and monk fruit
    have been used “for hundreds of years by the people who live in the regions where
    they grow, so I don’t have huge worries about their safety,” Walters told me.'

    2008 年和 2010 年首次获得 FDA 批准，现在可以在诸如 Truly 硬苏打水和 Fairlife 蛋白奶昔中找到。甜菊和罗汉果已经被“生长地区的人们使用数百年”，所以我对它们的安全性并没有太大担忧，Walters
    告诉我。

    other than just sugar can bind to the tongue’s sweet receptors, signaling to the

    Compared with sugar, stevia, and monk fruit, brazzein molecules are relatively

- en: The most compelling upside of brazzein may be that it tastes pretty good. My
    palate, which is extra sensitive to artificial sweeteners, wasn’t offended by
    the taste. *Would drink again*, I thought. But the glaring caveat with Oobli’s
    teas is that they do contain some actual sugar—just less than you’d expect from

    that intensified, and felt oddly cool, as I exhaled. It was not unpleasant, but
    it was also reminiscent of having accidentally swallowed minty gum. If Diet Coke
    were made with brazzein instead of aspartame, Walters explained, you’d taste caffeine’s
    bitterness and the tartness of phosphoric acid before any sweetness, and when
    all of those flavors dissipated, the sweetness would hang around. “It’s just not
