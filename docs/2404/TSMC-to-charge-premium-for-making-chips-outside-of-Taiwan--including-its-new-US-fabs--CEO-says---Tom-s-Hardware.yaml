- en: In the recent years, TSMC has radically changed its strategy of making chips
    only in Taiwan and initiated expansion overseas. As a result, the company is now
    building up fabs in Germany, Japan, and the U.S. However, the world's top contract
    chip will charge its customers a premium if they want their chips to be made outside
    of Taiwan.

- en: '"If my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC
    and the customer had to share the incremental cost," said C.C. Wei, chief executive
    of TSMC, at the earnings call with analysts and investors (via [SeekingAlpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4684432-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-co-ltd-tsm-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript)).
    "We do encounter some kind of higher cost in the overseas or even recently, the
    inflation and the electricity. We expect our customers to share some of the higher
    cost with us, and we already started our discussion with our customers."'

    than the costs of building fabs in Taiwan and TSMC has complained about it a number
    of times in the past.  The company even had to delay production start at its Fab
    21 near Phoenix, Arizona, due to problems with tools installation and [negotiations
    with trade unions](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-and-arizona-labor-unions-come-to-agreement-fab-construction-back-on-track).

- en: Therefore, if a TSMC customer wants to produce its chips at a specific location,
    then the foundry will charge a premium. How high is that premium will be remains
    to be seen, but last year a media report indicated that chips made in Arizona
    on TSMC's N5 and N4 production nodes [could be from 20% to 30% more expensive
    than the same chips produced in Taiwan](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-to-charge-extra-for-us-made-chips).

- en: Due to higher construction and operational expenses of fabs in Japan, Germany,
    and the U.S., TSMC plans to transfer these additional costs to its customers to
    sustain its target gross margin of 53%. Although American chip designers may not
    welcome the increased production costs in the U.S., they will probably manufacture
    chips intended for government and other markets less sensitive to price increases
    at the Arizona facility. Consequently, they should manage to pass on these higher
    costs to at least some of their end customers without jeopardizing their market
    competitiveness.

- en: '"In today''s fragmented globalization environment, cost will be higher for
    everyone, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors and the entire semiconductor
    industry," the head of TSMC said. "We plan to manage and minimize the overseas
    cost gap by, first, pricing strategically to reflect the value of geographic flexibility;
    second, working closely with government to secure their support; and third, leveraging
    our fundamental advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, and our large-scale
    manufacturing base, which no other manufacturer in this industry can match."'

    request a specific manufacturing location, then TSMC will not charge its 'location'
    premium. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether TSMC's yields in Taiwan, Germany,
    Japan, and the U.S. will be similar.
