- en: 'I thought of another reason I don’t really like the metric system: Base 10
    is not a good base. You want your base to either be a power of 2 so that you can
    keep dividing by two (like a gallon has 128 fluid ounces) or have a bunch of useful
    factors (like a foot has 12 inches, so you can easily get ⅓ or ¼; and a minute
    has 60 seconds). Base 10’s factors are not great; you rarely want to divide anything
    by 5.'

- en: Some alien race has eight fingers, and when they visit here they understand
    *why* we use base 10, but it must be striking to them how bad of a base it is.
    Like you have 100 grams and you can divide it by 2 twice and after that you can
    only divide it by 5\. Who needs to divide by 5? Especially in cooking.

- en: It’d be like if we found an alien species that used base 14 for everything.
    One unit, then 14, then 196?! If you have 196 grams, you can divide it by 2 twice
    and then you can only divide it by 7? Bad base! Use 12 or 8 or something.
