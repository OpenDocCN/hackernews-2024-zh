- en: PALMER, Tex. — Perched in the cab of a 35,000-pound semi-truck lumbering south
    on Interstate 45, AJ Jenkins watched the road while the big rig’s steering wheel
    slid through his hands. Jenkins was in the driver’s seat, but he wasn’t driving.
    The gigantic 18-wheeler was guiding itself.

    slowed for an emergency vehicle. Exiting the highway, it came to an abrupt stop
    as a pickup jumped its turn at a four-way intersection.
