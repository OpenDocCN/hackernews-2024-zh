**1\. Efficiency / Coefficient of performance** – Efficiency / coefficient of performance (COP) can be very high in some thermoelectric cooling applications and / or with proper system design. In other thermoelectric cooling applications and /or with poor system design, COP can be very low relative to other cooling technologies. So efficiency depends on the application and how well the system is engineered.

Another important idea is high thermoelectric cooling efficiency is not always needed. Small purposefully designed inefficient low-cost thermoelectric refrigerators are a popular and viable product that would not be viable with other cooling technologies. And customers are completely happy without ever considering if the product has a high cooling efficiency or not.

Efficient products are often desired because they consume less power which makes them less costly to operate. To achieve less power consumption, thermoelectric cooling can be used for spot, zonal or distributed cooling rather than cooling an entire enclosure with another cooling technology that is not capable of spot cooling. 

Although some cooling technologies can more efficient (higher COP) than thermoelectric cooling in some cases, the power consumption is still lower for the spot or zonal cooling using a thermoelectric cooling. 

For example one could use 10 watts of power to cool an object using an inefficient design or technology. Or use the most efficient cooling technology that cools an entire enclosure with 100 watts of power. High efficiency becomes irrelevant here. The choice is to use 10 watts or 100 watts of power consumption. It does not matter if the 100 watts of cooling is generated with a more efficient technology, it’s still 100 watts of power rather than 10 watts.

**2\. Deceivingly Simple Appearance** – Thermoelectric cooling modules look simple enough. No moving parts, no complex mechanical contraptions, lights, sounds or vibrations. This simplistic look sometimes sends the wrong impression. The impression is that anybody can work with thermoelectric modules and achieve the desired results. 

As it turns out, many try and fail to achieve results before asking for help. Worse yet, some assume that since they could not make the thermoelectric module do what they wanted it to, nobody can. And another unique and viable thermoelectric cooling product can go unrealized.

**3\. Cost-per-watt of Cooling** – If the only consideration for a given cooling application is cost per watt of cooling power, in some cases for some applications, cooling methods outside of thermoelectric cooling can be lower cost-per-watt of cooling power. However, cost-per-watt is never the only factor to be considered for a given application. Even if cost-per-watt is lower for a non-thermoelectric cooling application, other costs may be high when taking into other considerations such as reliability, size, design flexibility, environmental factors, temperature control, scalability, efficiency, maintenance, and other factors.

**4\. Limited Thermoelectric Engineering Expertise** – There is a limited amount of engineering expertise to apply thermoelectric cooling to product design. Because of this, good help is hard to find. Thermoelectric module manufactures direct customers to try their products. And when the desired outcome is not achieved, customers give up and assume thermoelectric technology is not right for their application.

**5\. A Lot of Variables** – To achieve a viable product that uses thermoelectric cooling, many variables need to be considered. Sometimes it is obvious that thermoelectric cooling is not right for a particular application, but most of the time that determination requires a skilled engineer, experience, deep thought, and computer simulations.
