- en: When Megan, a 50-year-old mother based in Tumwater, visited the new AI-powered
    mobile site from [Washington’s Lottery](https://www.walottery.com/) on March 30,
    she thought she was in for some frivolous fun. [Test Drive A Win](https://testdriveawin.com/)
    allows users to digitally throw a dart at a dartboard featuring dream vacations
    you can pay for with the money you win in the lottery. Depending on where the
    dart lands, you can either upload a headshot or take one on your phone to upload,
    and the AI superimposes your image into the vacation spot.

    The photo that was created shows a smiling AI version of Megan, but almost completely
    nude.

    no top. Her bare breasts are exposed. The background of the image appears to show
    the bedroom in an aquarium, with fish swimming around her. There is a Washington’s
    Lottery logo in the bottom right corner.

    the content. The Jason Rantz Show on KTTH could not, of course, authenticate the
    image. However, a spokesperson for Washington’s Lottery confirmed they received
    a report that the image was created by the AI system.

    Washington’s Lottery pulled the site offline. They also provided a statement.

- en: “We were made aware that a single user of the AI platform was purportedly provided
    an image that did not adhere to the built-in parameters set by the developers.
    Prior to launch, we agreed to a comprehensive set of rules to govern image creation,
    including that people in images be fully clothed. We have not seen the image that
    the AI provided to this user, but out of an abundance of caution we took the website
    down,” the spokesperson confirmed to the Jason Rantz Show on KTTH.

    check all the parameters for the platform and were comfortable with the settings,
    but after further internal discussions today, we chose to take down the site out
    of an abundance of caution, as we don’t want something like this purported event
    to happen again.
