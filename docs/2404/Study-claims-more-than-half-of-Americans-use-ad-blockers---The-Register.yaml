    programming, and security professionals that fraction is more like two-thirds
    to three-quarters.

    on behalf of Ghostery, a maker of software to block ads and online tracking, [52
    percent of Americans](https://www.ghostery.com/blog/privacy-report-advertisers-and-adblockers)
    now use an ad blocker, up from 34 percent according to 2022 Statista data.

    at least five years in their respective fields – veteran advertisers, programmers,

    72 percent of experienced programmers, and 76 percent of cybersecurity experts
    use ad blockers.

    privacy (20 percent) than blocking ads (18 percent), with another 9 percent wanting
    faster web page loading.

    – 27 percent, 30 percent, and 29 percent – for advertisers, developers, and security
    pros respectively.

    in security or in advertising – they''ve all over the years decided that it was
    a good idea to use a tracker blocker or content blocker or adblocker, whatever
    you call it," said Jean-Paul Schmetz, CEO of Ghostery, in an interview with *The
    Register*. "It''s pretty unanimous that people who work in this industry and know
    how these things function want to protect themselves."'

    trust various companies that collect online data. "It's quite amazing that Google
    is still trusted, even though it is the biggest collector."

    most wary of TikTok (59 percent), followed by: Meta (56 percent), X/Twitter (49
    percent), OpenAI (48 percent), Google (44 percent), Apple (41 percent), Amazon
    (40 percent), Microsoft (38 percent), Comscore (32 percent), and Adobe (31 percent).'

    York Times or at other sites. Maybe a better example is if you''re going to, let''s
    say Planned Parenthood or something similar, especially in this day and age. I
    think it would surprise 100 percent of the visitors to know that other companies
    are looking at that visit." ®'
