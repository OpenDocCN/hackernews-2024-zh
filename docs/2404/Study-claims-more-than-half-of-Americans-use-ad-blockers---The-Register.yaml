    in security or in advertising – they''ve all over the years decided that it was
    a good idea to use a tracker blocker or content blocker or adblocker, whatever
    you call it," said Jean-Paul Schmetz, CEO of Ghostery, in an interview with *The
    Register*. "It''s pretty unanimous that people who work in this industry and know
    how these things function want to protect themselves."'
