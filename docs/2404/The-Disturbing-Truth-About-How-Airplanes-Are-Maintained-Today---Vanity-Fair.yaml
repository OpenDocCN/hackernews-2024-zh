- en: Not long ago I was waiting for a domestic flight in a departure lounge at one
    of the crumbling midcentury sheds that pass for an American airport these days.
    There were delays, as we’ve all come to expect, and then the delays turned into
    something more ominous. The airplane I was waiting for had a serious maintenance
    issue, beyond the ability of a man in an orange vest to address. The entire airplane
    would have to be taken away for servicing and another brought to the gate in its
    place. This would take a while. Those of us in the departure lounge settled in
    for what we suspected might be hours. From the window I watched the ground crew
    unload the bags from the original airplane. When the new one arrived, the crew
    pumped the fuel, loaded the bags, and stocked the galley. It was a scene I’d witnessed
    countless times. Soon we would board and be on the way to our destinations.

  zh: 不久前，我在一个摇摇欲坠的20世纪中期建筑物改造成的美国机场候机室等待国内航班。我们都已经习惯了延误，然后延误变得更加不祥。我等待的飞机出现了严重的维修问题，一个穿橙色背心的人无法解决。整架飞机需要送去维修，另一架飞机将会被送到登机口。这将需要一些时间。我们候机室的人们开始准备迎接可能会持续几个小时的等待。我从窗户看着地勤人员卸载原飞机的行李。当新飞机到达时，工作人员加油、装载行李和补充厨房用品。这是我无数次见过的场景。很快我们就会登机，前往我们的目的地。
- en: As for the first airplane, the one with the maintenance problem—what was its
    destination going to be? When you have time on your hands, you begin to wonder
    about things like this. My own assumption, as yours might have been, was that
    the aircraft would be towed to a nearby hangar for a stopgap repair and then flown
    to a central maintenance facility run by the airline somewhere in the U.S. Or
    maybe there was one right here at the airport. In any case, if it needed a major
    overhaul, presumably it would be performed by the airline’s staff of trained professionals.
    If Apple feels it needs a “Genius Bar” at its stores to deal with hardware and
    software that cost a few hundred dollars, an airline must have something equivalent
    to safeguard an airplane worth a few hundred million.

  zh: 至于第一架飞机，那个有维修问题的飞机——它的目的地会是什么？当你手头有空时，你开始想象这种事情。我自己的假设，也许你也有同样的想法，是这架飞机会被拖到附近的机库进行临时修理，然后飞到航空公司在美国某处运营的中心维修设施。或者也许这里就有一个。无论如何，如果它需要进行重大的彻底检修，理应由航空公司的专业团队来执行。如果苹果觉得他们的店铺需要一个“天才吧”来处理几百美元的硬件和软件，那么一家航空公司肯定也必须有相应的设施来保护价值数亿美元的飞机。
- en: About this I would be wrong—as wrong as it is possible to be. Over the past
    decade, nearly all large U.S. airlines have shifted heavy maintenance work on
    their airplanes to repair shops thousands of miles away, in developing countries,
    where the mechanics who take the planes apart (completely) and put them back together
    (or almost) may not even be able to read or speak English. US Airways and Southwest
    fly planes to a maintenance facility in El Salvador. Delta sends planes to Mexico.
    United uses a shop in China. American still does much of its most intensive maintenance
    in-house in the U.S., but that is likely to change in the aftermath of the company’s
    merger with US Airways.

  zh: 关于这一点，我可能是错的——错得可能性极大。在过去的十年里，几乎所有大型美国航空公司都把他们飞机的重大维修工作转移到了数千英里之外的发展中国家的修理厂进行，那里的机械师可能连读写英语都不会。美国航空和西南航空飞往萨尔瓦多的一个维修设施。达美航空将飞机送往墨西哥。联合航空使用中国的一家店铺。美国航空仍然在美国国内进行大部分最为密集的维护工作，但在与美国航空合并后，这种情况可能会发生变化。

- en: 'The airlines are shipping this maintenance work offshore for the reason you’d
    expect: to cut labor costs. Mechanics in El Salvador, Mexico, China, and elsewhere
    earn a fraction of what mechanics in the U.S. do. In part because of this offshoring,
    the number of maintenance jobs at U.S. carriers has plummeted, from 72,000 in
    the year 2000 to fewer than 50,000 today. But the issue isn’t just jobs. A century
    ago, Upton Sinclair wrote his novel *The Jungle* to call attention to the plight
    of workers in the slaughterhouses, but what really got people upset was learning
    how unsafe their meat was. Safety is an issue here, too. The Federal Aviation
    Administration is supposed to be inspecting all the overseas facilities that do
    maintenance for airlines—just as it is supposed to inspect those in America. But
    the F.A.A. no longer has the money or the manpower to do this.'

  zh: 航空公司的做法是为了一个显然的原因：削减劳动力成本。萨尔瓦多、墨西哥、中国等地的机械师所得酬劳仅为美国机械师的几分之一。正是由于这一点的海外外包，美国航空公司的维修岗位急剧下降，从2000年的72,000降至如今的少于50,000。但这不仅仅是就业问题。上个世纪，Upton
    Sinclair在他的小说《丛林》中描写屠宰场工人的艰难处境，警示人们关注的不仅仅是肉类安全问题。这里的安全性同样是一个问题。美国联邦航空管理局本应监督所有为航空公司提供维修服务的海外设施，就如同它也监督美国境内的设施一样。但美国联邦航空管理局现今已无钱也无足够人力执行此项工作。
- en: One of the fastest-growing of the offshore repair sites is on the perimeter
    of El Salvador’s Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport. Named for
    the archbishop who was assassinated during Mass in 1980, the airport has become
    a busy hub, owing largely to a steady influx of foreign jetliners needing maintenance
    and repair. Jets flying the insignia of US Airways, Southwest, Jet Blue, and many
    smaller American carriers are a common sight as they touch down and taxi to the
    Aeroman complex at the edge of the field.

- en: Aeroman was once the repair base for El Salvador’s modest national airline.
    It has mushroomed into a complex of five hangars, 18 production lines, and numerous
    specialty shops that perform virtually all phases of aircraft overhaul. The company
    has picked up the familiar multi-national technobabble, describing itself as a
    “world leader in providing aircraft-maintenance solutions.” About 2,000 mechanics
    and other employees work in the company’s tightly guarded airport compound, encircled
    by a fence and barbed wire.

  zh: Aeroman曾是萨尔瓦多小型国家航空公司的维修基地，但它已扩张成包含五个停机库、18条生产线以及执行飞机多种维修阶段的多家特化车间的复杂设施。公司自诩为“提供航空维修解决方案的世界领导者”。其公司的2,000多名机械师和其他员工在紧密保护的机场园区内工作，园区围有铁丝网和铁丝围栏。
- en: The airplanes that U.S. carriers send to Aeroman undergo what’s known in the
    industry as “heavy maintenance,” which often involves a complete teardown of the
    aircraft. Every plate and panel on the wings, tail, flaps, and rudder are unscrewed,
    and all the parts within—cables, brackets, bearings, and bolts—are removed for
    inspection. The landing gear is disassembled and checked for cracks, hydraulic
    leaks, and corrosion. The engines are removed and inspected for wear. Inside,
    the passenger seats, tray tables, overhead bins, carpeting, and side panels are
    removed until the cabin has been stripped down to bare metal. Then everything
    is put back exactly where it was, at least in theory.

  zh: 美国航空公司的飞机送往Aeroman进行所谓的“大型维修”，这通常涉及对飞机进行彻底拆解。机翼、尾部、襟翼和尾舵上的每一块面板和每一块板都将被拆卸，机舱内部的电线、支架、轴承和螺栓等都需移除检查。起落架将分解检查裂纹、液压泄露和腐蚀情况。引擎将被移除检查磨损情况。内部，乘客座椅、餐车桌、行李舱、地毯和侧壁板逐一移除直至机舱白铁外壳显露。然后，将所有组件还原到原始位置，至少理论上去讲是这样的。
