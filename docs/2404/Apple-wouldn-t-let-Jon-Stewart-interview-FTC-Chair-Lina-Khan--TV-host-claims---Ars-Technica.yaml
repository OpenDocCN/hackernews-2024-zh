    forbade the inclusion of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan as a guest and
    steered the show away from confronting issues related to artificial intelligence,
    according to Jon Stewart.

    the Apple TV+ show was canceled last October, reports circulated that he told
    his staff that creative differences over guests and topics were [a factor in the
    decision](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/report-apple-cancels-the-problem-with-jon-stewart-over-china-ai-topics/).

    "They wouldn’t let us do that dumb thing we did in the first act on AI," he said,

    episode.

    act of the episode mocked various tech executives for their utopian framing of
    AI and interspersed those claims with acknowledgments from many of the same leaders
    that AI would replace many people's jobs. (It did not mention Apple or its leadership,
    though.)

    suggesting that workers be retrained to work with or on AI when their current
    roles are disrupted by it. That was followed by a montage of US political leaders
    promising to retrain workers after various technological and economic disruptions
    over the years, with the implication that those retraining efforts were rarely
    as successful as promised.

    stopped short of venturing any solutions or alternatives to the current path,
    so it mostly just prompted outrage and laughs.

    is the new frontier in AI that has attracted worry, optimism, and criticism from
