- en: One of the biggest provinces in Canada is making the use of [autonomous vehicles](https://www.thedrive.com/category/self-driving-tech)
    illegal on public roads. [British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/road-safety-rules-and-consequences/self-drive)
    has banned self-driving vehicles that exceed an SAE autonomy rating of Level 2,
    which makes the operation of any vehicle with Levels 3, 4, and 5 illegal in the
    interest of public safety. The ban is part of an update to [B.C.'s Motor Vehicle
    Act](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024MOTI0046-000476) that went into effect
    on April 5, 2024, after being proposed by legislators in 2023\.

- en: The provincial government says this latest update of the "[Motor Vehicle Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96318_00) prohibits
    a person from driving, or permitting the driving of, a Level 3, 4 or 5 automated
    vehicle. This means that highly automated self-driving vehicles cannot yet be
    driven on public roads in B.C., nor can highly automated self-driving features
    be used..." The ban is in effect for now, but that could change as the tech evolves.
    The rules also outline possible consequences for drivers, which will range up
    to a max penalty of $2,000 (CAD) in fines, or just shy of $1,500 at current exchange
    rates. Violators (a person in charge of a "self-driving" car) could also face
    up to six months of prison time.

    begin with milder fines of $368 (CAD), or $266, along with three penalty points
    on their licenses. Points can eventually lead to license suspensions, and of course,
    they have an adverse effect on auto insurance rates. The more points on your license,
    the higher the price of insurance becomes.

    [Tesla](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39647/tesla-admits-current-full-self-driving-beta-will-always-be-a-level-2-system-emails)
    owners who use Autopilot and FSD won't have to worry about their insurance premiums
    going sky high—or, at least, not going any higher than they already are. Ford
    and GM vehicle owners with BlueCruise and Super Cruise are also exempt from the
    ban.

- en: It's worth noting that banning "highly automated" vehicles, as the British Columbian
    government refers to them, might seem like a dramatic move, but it isn't such
    a sweeping prohibition as it first seems. There are no Level 3 autonomous vehicles
    for sale in Canada at the moment, and Levels 3, 4 and 5 continue to elude most
    automakers. Few cars have achieved these ratings, which do not require human monitoring.
    These include the Mercedes-Benz EQS and S-Class with Drive Pilot, as well as the
    Honda Legend with Honda Sensing Elite. But these cars paired with their specific
    AV tech are available only outside of Canada and are subject to conditional use
    in their respective markets.

- en: All of which is to say that Level 3 AVs are exceedingly rare around the world,
    and remain virtually nonexistent in British Columbia. But the decision to ban
    "self-driving" cars could be a preemptive one, and it may prove beneficial for
    B.C. residents who mistrust AVs on public roads. A 2023 study conducted by the
    University of British Columbia's REACT Lab found that the majority of respondents
    are [wary of AVs](https://www.thedrive.com/news/most-americans-wary-of-self-driving-cars-as-trust-in-tesla-wanes-study)
    and agree that regulation is necessary to gradually unleash self-driving cars
    into the wild. This gradual approach seems to be in contrast to that of the U.S.,
    where autonomous vehicles from Waymo and Cruise have wreaked havoc on public roads
    from the Pacific Northwest to southern California.
