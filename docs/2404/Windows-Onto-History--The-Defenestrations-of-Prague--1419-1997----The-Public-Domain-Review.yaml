- en: 'Two Catholic deputies, Jaroslav Bořita of Martinice and Vilém Slavata of Chlum,
    had grown notorious for openly disavowing the *Majestätsbrief*: Rudolf II’s 1609
    liberal guarantee of religious tolerance. When a Protestant assembly spurned by
    the shuttered chapels in Klostergrab and Braunau attracted a massive crowd, Martinice
    and Slavata began to worry. And when the count Jindřich Matyáš Thurn, elected
    defender of the Protestant faith, called for their execution, they realized it
    was already too late. The Catholic deputies had overplayed their hand; the mood
    among the infuriated townspeople was rising to a fever pitch. A large crowd followed
    the Protestant nobles to Hradčany Castle. They poured inside and to the upper
    floors, cornering Martinice and Slavata in a tower chamber. Shouting at, threatening,
    and then grabbing the deputies, they chucked Martinice out the window first. Slavata,
    meanwhile, held onto the ledge, begging for the Virgin’s intercession. In one
    final push, the crowd expelled him from the castle window as well. Only the deputies’
    secretary remained. Shaking with fear, he clung to the prominent Protestant nobleman
    Joachim von Schlick for protection, but the defenestrators, as they would come
    to be called, peeled him off Schlick and tossed him out the window too.'
