# Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)

> 来源：[https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/)

## Select an image

Ubuntu is distributed on three types of images described below.

### Desktop image

The desktop image allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of image is what most people will want to use. You will need at least 1024MiB of RAM to install from this image.

[64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image](ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso)

Choose this if you have a computer based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). Choose this if you are at all unsure.

### Server install image

The server install image allows you to install Ubuntu permanently on a computer for use as a server. It will not install a graphical user interface.

[64-bit PC (AMD64) server install image](ubuntu-24.04-live-server-amd64.iso)

Choose this if you have a computer based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). Choose this if you are at all unsure.

### Netboot tarball

The netboot tarball contains files needed to boot the Ubuntu installer over the network.

[64-bit PC (AMD64) netboot tarball](ubuntu-24.04-netboot-amd64.tar.gz)

Choose this if you have a computer based on the AMD64 or EM64T architecture (e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, Core 2). Choose this if you are at all unsure.
