- en: Justice Minister Arif Virani has defended a new power in the [online harms bill](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-online-harms-bill-law/)
    to impose house arrest on someone who is feared to commit a hate crime in the
    future – even if they have not yet done so already.

    requests it, or ordered by a judge to remain at home, the bill says.

- en: Mr. Virani, who is Attorney-General as well as Justice Minister, said it is
    important that any peace bond be “calibrated carefully,” saying it would have
    to meet a high threshold to apply.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But he said the new power, which would require the attorney-general’s approval
    as well as a judge’s, could prove “very, very important” to restrain the behaviour
    of someone with a track record of hateful behaviour who may be targeting certain
    people or groups.

    come forward and seek a peace bond against them and to prevent them from doing
    certain things.”

    or a mosque, he said. It could also lead to restrictions on internet usage and
    behaviour. “That would help to deradicalize people who are learning things online
    and acting out in the real world violently – sometimes fatally.”

    establishes a new hate-crime offence, which would carry a maximum penalty of life
    imprisonment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mr. Virani said the hate-crime offence would only be applied if coupled with
    another crime and the life sentence would only apply in the most serious of cases
    – not, for example, for mischief to a garage door.

    This is not a mandatory minimum of a life sentence, this is just a larger range,
    including what would be the maximum sentence,” he said.

    material, as well as sexual content posted without consent. But the government
    stepped back from forcing platforms to take down hate speech within 24 hours,
    introducing other tools to deal with this, including through a complaint to a
    new ombudsperson.

    Commission over what they perceive as hate speech online – including, for example,
    off-colour jokes by comedians. People found guilty of posting hate speech could
    have to pay victims up to $20,000 in compensation.

    to throw out frivolous complaints, including a kind of “summary dismissal mechanism”
    if a complaint does not hit the threshold for hatred or if someone files a complaint
    in bad faith. Costs could also be issued.

    taken down within 24 hours, he would expect the response of the regulator, ombudsperson
    or other body examining a complaint to be “prompt.” Fears have been expressed
    that they could take months or even years to adjudicate on whether posts should
    be removed.

    very quickly,” he said. He added for this reason it is critical that the bill
    progresses through Parliament to committee swiftly so the government can look
    at amendments.
