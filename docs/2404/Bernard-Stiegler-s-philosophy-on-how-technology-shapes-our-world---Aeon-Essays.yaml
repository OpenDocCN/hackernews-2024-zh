    data feeds, biometric feedback loops, digital protheses and expanding networks

    and create new political possibilities. And vast wireless networks – connecting

    being waged. Our experiences of the world are *soaked* with digital technologies.

- en: But for the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler, one of the earliest and foremost
    theorists of our digital age, understanding the world requires us to move beyond
    the standard view of technology. Stiegler believed that technology is not just
    about the effects of digital tools and the ways that they impact our lives. It
    is not just about how devices are created and wielded by powerful organisations,
    nation-states or individuals. Our relationship with technology is about something
    deeper and more fundamental. It is about *technics*.

  zh: 但对于法国哲学家伯纳德·斯蒂格勒来说，他是我们数字时代最早也是最重要的理论家之一，理解这个世界需要我们超越技术的标准观点。斯蒂格勒认为，技术不仅仅是数字工具的影响及其对我们生活的影响方式。它不仅仅是强大组织、国家或个人创造和运用设备的方式。我们与技术的关系更加深刻和更加根本。它与*技术*有关。
- en: 'According to Stiegler, technics – the making and use of technology, in the
    broadest sense – is what makes us human. Our unique way of existing in the world,
    as distinct from other species, is defined by the experiences and knowledge our
    tools make possible, whether that is a state-of-the-art brain-computer interface
    such as Neuralink, or a prehistoric flint axe used to clear a forest. But don’t
    be mistaken: ‘technics’ is not simply another word for ‘technology’. As [Martin
    Heidegger](https://psyche.co/ideas/gardening-with-heidegger-from-mystery-to-truth-via-the-earth)
    wrote in his essay ‘The Question Concerning Technology’ (1954), which used the
    German term *Technik* instead of *Technologie* in the original title: the ‘essence
    of technology is by no means anything technological.’ This aligns with the history
    of the word: the etymology of ‘technics’ leads us back to something like the ancient
    Greek term for art – *technē*. The essence of technology, then, is not found in
    a device, such as the one you are using to read this essay. It is an open-ended
    creative process, a relationship with our tools and the world.'

  zh: 按照斯蒂格勒的说法，技术——在最宽泛的意义上，制造和使用技术——是使我们成为人类的本质。我们在世界上独特的生存方式，与其他物种不同，是由我们的工具能够产生的经验和知识所定义的，无论那是一款最先进的脑机接口，比如Neuralink，还是用来清理森林的史前燧石斧头。但不要误会：‘技术’不仅仅是‘技术’的另一个词。正如[马丁·海德格](https://psyche.co/ideas/gardening-with-heidegger-from-mystery-to-truth-via-the-earth)在他的1954年的文章‘关于技术的问题’中写到的那样，原标题使用德文词*Technik*而不是*Technologie*。技术的本质绝对不是技术的东西。这与这个词的历史一致：‘技术’的词源使我们回想起古希腊语词汇，比如古典音乐——*technē*。因此，技术的本质并不在于设备，比如你用来阅读这篇文章的设备。它是一个开放式的创造过程，是与我们的工具和世界的关系。

    first explored while he was imprisoned for armed robbery, further than anyone
    else. But his ideas have often been overlooked and misunderstood, even before
    he died in 2020\. Today, they are more necessary than ever. How else can we learn
    to disentangle the effects of digital technologies from our everyday experiences?

- en: 'Stiegler’s path to becoming the pre-eminentphilosopher of our digital age was
    anything but straightforward. He was born in Villebon-sur-Yvette, south of Paris,
    in 1952, during a period of affluence and rejuvenation in France that followed
    the devastation of the Second World War. By the time he was 16, Stiegler participated
    in the revolutionary wave of 1968 (he would later become a member of the Communist
    Party), when a radical uprising of students and workers forced the president Charles
    de Gaulle to seek temporary refuge across the border in West Germany. However,
    after a new election was called and the barricades were dismantled, Stiegler became
    disenchanted with traditional Marxism, as well as the political trends circulating
    in France at the time. The Left in France seemed helplessly torn between the postwar
    existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre and the anti-humanism of Louis Althusser. While
    Sartre insisted on humans’ creative capacity to shape their own destiny, Althusser
    argued that the pervasiveness of ideology in capitalist society had left us helplessly
    entrenched in systems of power beyond our control. Neither of these options satisfied
    Stiegler because neither could account for the rapid rise of a new historical
    force: electronic technology. By the 1970s and ’80s, Stiegler sensed that this
    new technology was redefining our relationship to ourselves, to the world, and
    to each other. To account for these new conditions, he believed the history of
    philosophy would have to be rewritten from the ground up, from the perspective
    of technics. Neither existentialism nor Marxism nor any other school of philosophy
    had come close to acknowledging the fundamental link between human existence and
    the evolutionary history of tools.'

  zh: 斯蒂格勒通向成为我们数字时代卓越哲学家的道路绝非一帆风顺。他出生于巴黎南部伊维特河畔的维勒邦，1952年，那是第二次世界大战后法国繁荣复兴的时期。到16岁时，斯蒂格勒参与了1968年的革命浪潮（他后来成为共产党成员），当时学生和工人的激进起义迫使总统戴高乐寻求在西德的临时庇护所。然而，在重新举行新选举并拆除街垒后，斯蒂格勒对传统马克思主义和当时在法国流行的政治潮流感到幻灭。法国左派似乎无能为力地陷入了战后存在主义者让-保罗·萨特和反人道主义者路易·阿尔都塞之间的矛盾。虽然萨特坚持认为人类具有塑造自己命运的创造能力，但阿尔都塞认为，资本主义社会中意识形态的普遍性使我们无力摆脱我们控制之外的权力体系。这两种选择都不能满足斯蒂格勒，因为它们都无法解释新历史力量的迅速崛起：电子技术。到了20世纪70年代和80年代，斯蒂格勒意识到这种新技术正在重新定义我们与自己、与世界以及与彼此的关系。为了解释这些新条件，他认为哲学史必须从技术的视角重新从头写起。无论是存在主义、马克思主义还是其他任何哲学流派，都没有能够承认人类存在与工具进化历史之间的根本联系。

    down by the police a few years later for illegal prostitution. Desperate to make
    ends meet, Stiegler turned to robbing banks to pay off his debts and feed his
    family. In 1978, he was arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to five years
    in prison. A high-school dropout who was never comfortable in institutional settings,
    Stiegler requested his own cell when he first arrived in prison, and went on a
    hunger strike until it was granted. After the warden finally acquiesced, Stiegler
    began taking note of how his relationship to the outside world was mediated through
    reading and writing. This would be a crucial realisation. Through books, paper
    and pencils, he was able to interface with people and places beyond the prison
    walls.

    describes his time in prison as one of radical self-exploration and philosophical
    experimentation. He read classic works of Greek philosophy, studied English and
    memorised modern poetry, but the book that really drew his attention was Plato’s
    *Phaedrus.* In this dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, Plato outlines his
    concept of *anamnesis*, a theory of learning that states the acquisition of new
    knowledge is just a process of *remembering* what we once knew in a previous life.
    Caught in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, we forget what we know each time
    we are reborn. For Stiegler, this idea of learning as recollection would become
    less spiritual and more material: learning and memory are tied inextricably to
    technics. Through the tools we use – including books, writing, archives – we can

- en: After an initial attempt at writing fiction in prison, Stiegler enrolled in
    a philosophy programme designed for inmates. While still serving his sentence,
    he finished a degree in philosophy and corresponded with prominent intellectuals
    such as the philosopher and translator Gérard Granel, who was a well-connected
    professor at the University of Toulouse-Le Mirail (later known as the University
    of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès). Granel introduced Stiegler to some of the most prominent
    figures in philosophy at the time, including Jean-François Lyotard and [Jacques
    Derrida](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-deconstruct-the-world-by-thinking-like-jacques-derrida).
    Lyotard would oversee Stiegler’s master’s thesis after his eventual release; Derrida
    would supervise his doctoral dissertation, completed in 1993, which was reworked
    and published a year later as the first volume in his *Technics and Time* series.
    With the help of these philosophers and their novel ideals, Stiegler began to

    world instead presented itself as a built environment composed of things such
    as roads, power plants and houses, all made possible by political institutions,

- en: One of the French philosophers who interrogated the immediacy of reality most
    closely was Louis Althusser. In his essay ‘Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses’
    published in 1970, years before Stiegler was taught by him, Althusser suggests
    that ideology is not something that an individual believes in, but something that
    goes far beyond the scale of a single person, or even a community. Just as we
    unthinkingly turn around when we hear our name shouted from behind, ideology has
    a hold on us that is both automatic and unconscious – it seeps in from outside.
    [Michel Foucault](https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever),
    a former student of Althusser at the École Normale Supérieurein Paris, developed
    a theory of power that functions in a similar way. In *Discipline and Punish*
    (1975) and elsewhere, Foucault argues that social and political power is not concentrated
    in individuals but is produced by ‘discourses, institutions, architectural forms,
    regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical,
    moral and philanthropic propositions’. Foucault’s insight was to show how power
    shapes every facet of the world, from classroom interactions between a teacher
    and student to negotiations of a trade agreement between representatives of two
    different nations. From this perspective, power is constituted in and through
    material practices, rather than something possessed by individual subjects.

  zh: 法国哲学家中，最深刻质疑现实的之一是**路易·阿尔都塞**。在他于1970年发表的文章《意识形态与意识形态国家机器》中，比斯蒂格勒受其教导前数年，阿尔都塞建议意识形态并非个体所信仰的东西，而是超越个人甚至社区尺度的事物。正如我们无意识地在听到背后有人叫我们名字时转身一样，意识形态对我们的控制既是自动的又是无意识的——它渗透自外而内。[米歇尔·福柯](https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever)，他曾是阿尔都塞在巴黎高等师范学校的学生，进而发展出一种权力理论，其功能方式相似。在《规训与惩罚》（1975）及其他作品中，福柯主张社会和政治权力并非集中于个人，而是由“话语、制度、建筑形式、规范决策、法律、行政措施、科学陈述、哲学、道德和慈善建议”产生。福柯的洞察是展示权力如何塑造世界的每个方面，从教师与学生的课堂互动到两个不同国家代表之间的贸易协议谈判。从这个视角看，权力在于通过实践中及物资实体，而不是个体主体所拥有的某物。

    Though he appreciated the ways that Foucault and Althusser had tried to account

    types of technology – not to mention the fact that neither thinker had offered
    any real alternatives to the forms of power they described. In his [book](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=17590)
    *Taking Care of Youth and the Generations* (2008), Stiegler explains that he was
    able to move beyond Foucault with the help of his mentor Derrida’s concept of
    the *pharmakon*. In his essay ‘Plato’s Pharmacy’ (1972), Derrida began developing
    the idea as he explored how our ability to write can create and undermine (‘cure’
    and ‘poison’) an individual subject’s sense of identity. For Derrida, the act
    of writing – itself a kind of technology – has a Janus-faced relationship to individual
    memory. Though it allows us to store knowledge and experience across vast periods
    of time, writing disincentivises us from practising our own mental capacity for
    recollection. The written word short-circuits the immediate connection between
    lived experience and internal memory. It ‘cures’ our cognitive limits, but also
    ‘poisons’ our cognition by limiting our abilities.

- en: In the late 20th century, Stiegler began applying this idea to new media technologies,
    such as television, which led to the development of a concept he called *pharmacology*
    – an idea that suggests we don’t simply ‘use’ our digital tools. Instead, they
    enter and pharmacologically change us, like medicinal drugs. Today, we can take
    this analogy even further. The internet presents us with a massive archive of
    formatted, readily accessible information. Sites such as Wikipedia contain terabytes
    of knowledge, accumulated and passed down over millennia. At the same time, this
    exchange of unprecedented amounts of information enables the dissemination of

    lives, the easier it is to forget that these tools are social products that have
    been constructed by our fellow humans. How we consume music, the paths we take
    to get from point A to point B, how we share ourselves with others, all of these
    aspects of daily life have been reshaped by new technologies and the humans that
    produce them. Yet we rarely stop to reflect on what this means for us. Stiegler
    believed this act of forgetting creates a deep crisis for all facets of human

- en: To further stress the importance of technics, Stiegler turns to the creation
    myth told by the Greek poet Hesiod in *Works and Days*, written around 700 BCE.
    During the world’s creation, Zeus asks the Titan Epimetheus to distribute individual
    talents to each species. Epimetheus gives wings to birds so they can fly, and
    fins to fish so they can swim. By the time he gets to humans, however, Epimetheus
    has no talents left over. Epimetheus, whose name (according to Stiegler) means
    the ‘forgetful one’ in Greek, turns to his brother Prometheus for help. Prometheus
    then steals fire from the gods, presenting it to humans in place of a biological
    talent. Humans, once more, are born out of an act of forgetting, just like in
    Plato’s theory of anamnesis. The difference with Hesiod’s story is that technics
    here provides a material basis for human experience. Bereft of any physiological
    talents, *Homo sapiens* must survive by using tools, beginning with fire.

- en: The pharmacologyof technics, for Stiegler, presents opportunities for positive
    or negative relationships with tools. ‘But where the danger lies,’ writes the
    poet Friedrich Hölderlin in a quote Stiegler often turned to, ‘also grows the
    saving power.’ While Derrida focuses on the ability of the written word to subvert
    the sovereignty of the individual subject, Stiegler widens this understanding
    of pharmacology to include a variety of media and technologies. Not just writing,
    but factories, server farms and even psychotropic drugs possess the pharmacological
    capacity to poison or cure our world and, crucially, our understanding of it.
    Technological development can destroy our sense of ourselves as rational, coherent
    subjects, leading to widespread suffering and destruction. But tools can also
    provide us with a new sense of what it means to be human, leading to new modes
    of expression and cultural practices.

  zh: 对斯蒂格勒来说，技术的药理学提供了与工具正面或负面关系的机会。诗人弗里德里希·黑尔德林在斯蒂格勒经常引用的一句话中写道：“但危险所在，救助之力也在。”虽然德里达关注书面文字颠覆个体主体的能力，斯蒂格勒将药理学的理解扩展到包括各种媒体和技术。不仅仅是书写，工厂、服务器农场甚至是精神药物都具有毒害或治愈我们世界以及对它的理解的药理能力至关重要。技术发展可能摧毁我们作为理性、连贯主体的自我意识，导致广泛的苦难和破坏。但工具也可以为我们提供新的人类存在意义，引领新的表达方式和文化实践。

    the effect that new technologies, especially those accompanying industrialisation,
    have had on art and music. Industry, defined by mass production and standardisation,
    is often regarded as antithetical to artistic freedom and expression. But Stiegler
    urges us to take a closer look at art history to see how artists responded to
    industrialisation. In response to the standardising effects of new machinery,
    for example, Marcel Duchamp and other members of the 20th-century avant-garde
    used industrial tools to invent novel forms of creative expression. In the [painting](https://philamuseum.org/collection/object/51449)
    *Nude Descending a Staircase, No 2* (1912), Duchamp employed the new temporal
    perspectives made possible by photography and cinema to paint a radically different
    kind of portrait. Inspired by the camera’s ability to capture movement, frame
    by frame, Duchamp paints a nude model who appears in multiple instants at once,
    like a series of time-lapse photographs superimposed onto each other. The image
    became an immediate sensation, an icon of modernity and the resulting entanglement
    of art and industrial technology.

- en: Technical innovations are never without political and social implications for
    Stiegler. The phonograph, for example, may have standardised classical musical
    performances after its invention in the late 1800s, but it also contributed to
    the development of jazz, a genre that was popular among musicians who were barred
    from accessing the elite world of classical music. Thanks to the gramophone, Black
    musicians such as the pianist and composer Duke Ellington were able to learn their
    instruments by ear, without first learning to read musical notation. The phonograph’s
    industrialisation of musical performance paradoxically led to the free-flowing
    improvisation of jazz performers.

- en: Technics draws our attention to the world-making capabilities of our tools,
    while reminding us of the constructed nature of our technological reality. Stiegler’s
    capacious understanding of technics, encompassing everything from early agricultural
    tools to the television set, does not disregard new innovations, either. In 2006,
    Stiegler founded the Institute for Research and Innovation, an organisation at
    the Centre Pompidou in Paris devoted to exploring the impact digital technology
    has on contemporary society. Stiegler’s belief in the power of technology to shape
    the world around us has often led to the charge that he is a techno-determinist
    who believes the entire course of history is shaped by tools and machines. It’s
    true that Stiegler thinks technology defines who we are as humans, but this process
    does not always lock us into predetermined outcomes. Instead, it simultaneously
    provides us with a material horizon of possible experience. Stiegler’s theory
    of technics urges us to rethink the history of philosophy, art and politics in
    order that we might better understand how our world has been shaped bytechnology.
    And by acquiring this historical consciousness, he hopes that we will ultimately
    design better tools, using technology to improve our world in meaningful ways.

  zh: 技术引起我们对工具的世界创造能力的关注，同时提醒我们技术现实的构建性质。斯蒂格勒对技术的广泛理解，包括从早期农业工具到电视机的一切，也不忽视新的创新。2006年，斯蒂格勒在巴黎蓬皮杜中心创立了研究和创新研究所，致力于探索数字技术对当代社会的影响。斯蒂格勒相信技术塑造了我们周围的世界，这常常使他被指责为技术决定论者，认为整个历史进程都是由工具和机器塑造的。的确，斯蒂格勒认为技术定义了我们作为人类的身份，但这个过程并不总是将我们锁定在预定的结果中。相反，它同时为我们提供了一种可能体验的物质视野。斯蒂格勒的技术理论敦促我们重新思考哲学、艺术和政治的历史，以更好地理解我们的世界是如何被技术塑造的。通过获得这种历史意识，他希望我们最终能够设计出更好的工具，利用技术以有意义的方式改善我们的世界。
- en: This doesn’t mean Stiegler is a techno-optimist, either, who blindly sees digital
    technology as a panacea for our problems. One particular concern he expresses
    about digital technology is its capacity to standardise the world we inhabit.
    Big data, for Stiegler, threatens to limit our sense of what is possible, rather
    than broadening our horizons and opening new opportunities for creative expression.
    Just as Hollywood films in the 20th century manufactured and distributed the ideology
    of consumer capitalism to the rest of the globe, Stiegler suggests that tech firms
    such as Google and Apple often disseminate values that are hidden from view. A
    potent example of this can be found in the first fully AI-judged beauty pageant.
    As discussed by the sociologist Ruha Benjamin in her [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/Race+After+Technology:+Abolitionist+Tools+for+the+New+Jim+Code-p-9781509526437)
    *Race After Technology* (2019), the developers of Beauty.AI advertised the contest
    as an opportunity for beauty to be judged in a way that was free of prejudice.
    What they found, however, was that the tool they had designed exhibited an overwhelming
    preference for white contestants.

  zh: 这并不意味着斯蒂格勒是一个技术乐观主义者，他并不盲目地将数字技术视为解决问题的万灵药。他对数字技术表达的一个特别关注是它标准化我们所居住的世界的能力。对斯蒂格勒来说，大数据威胁着限制我们对可能性的感知，而不是拓宽我们的视野并为创造性表达开启新的机会。正如20世纪好莱坞电影向全球其他地方传播和分发消费资本主义的意识形态一样，斯蒂格勒暗示像谷歌和苹果这样的科技公司经常传播隐藏的价值观。一个有力的例子可以在第一个完全由AI评判的选美大赛中找到。正如社会学家鲁哈·本杰明在她的《[科技之后的种族：废奴主义工具](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/Race+After+Technology:+Abolitionist+Tools+for+the+New+Jim+Code-p-9781509526437)》（2019）一书中讨论的那样，Beauty.AI的开发者宣传该比赛是一个无偏见地评判美丽的机会。然而，他们发现，他们设计的工具表现出对白人参赛者的压倒性偏爱。

    how big data can standardise our world by reorganising work and employment. Digital
    tools were first seen as a disruptive force that could break the monotonous rhythms
    of large industry, but the rise of flexible forms of employment in the gig economy
    has created a massive underclass. A new proletariat of Uber drivers and other
    precarious workers now labour under extremely unstable conditions. They are denied
    even the traditional protections of working-class employment. The digital economy
    doesn’t always offer desirable alternatives as former ways of working and living
    are destroyed.'

  zh: 在*《自动化社会，卷1：工作的未来》*(2016)中，斯蒂格勒展示了如何通过重组工作和就业来标准化我们的世界，利用大数据。数字工具最初被视为破坏性力量，可以打破大工业的单调节奏，但零工经济中灵活形式的兴起已经创造了一个庞大的底层阶级。如今，优步司机和其他不稳定工作者的新无产阶级在极不稳定的条件下劳动。他们甚至被剥夺了工人阶级传统的保护。数字经济并非总是提供理想的替代方案，因为以往的工作和生活方式正在被摧毁。
- en: 'A particularly pressing concern Stiegler took up before his untimely death
    in 2020 is the capacity of digital tools to surveil us. The rise of big tech firms
    such as Google and Amazon has meant the intrusion of surveillance tools into every
    aspect of our lives. Smart homes have round-the-clock video feeds, and marketing
    companies spend billions collecting data about everything we do online. In his
    last two books published in English, *The Neganthropocene* ([2018](http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/the-neganthropocene/))
    and *The Age of Disruption: Technology and Madness in Computational Capitalism*
    ([2019](https://www.wiley.com/en-au/The+Age+of+Disruption%3A+Technology+and+Madness+in+Computational+Capitalism-p-9781509529261)),
    Stiegler suggests that the growth of widespread surveillance tools is at odds
    with the pharmacological promise of new technology. Though tracking tools can
    be useful by, for example, limiting the spread of harmful diseases, they are also
    used to deny us worlds of possible experience.'

  zh: 斯蒂格勒在2020年不幸去世之前特别关注的一个问题是数字工具监视我们的能力。谷歌和亚马逊等大科技公司的兴起意味着监控工具侵入了我们生活的方方面面。智能家居有全天候视频监控，并且营销公司花费数十亿收集我们在线活动的数据。在他最后两本英文出版的书籍*《奈甘特罗波赛纪》*(2018)和*《混乱时代：计算资本主义中的技术与疯狂》*(2019)中，斯蒂格勒指出广泛监视工具的增长与新技术的药理学承诺不一致。尽管跟踪工具例如限制有害疾病的传播可能有用，但它们也被用来剥夺我们可能体验的世界。
- en: Technology, for better or worse, affects every aspect of our lives. Our very
    sense of who we are is shaped and reshaped by the tools we have at our disposal.
    The problem, for Stiegler, is that when we pay too much attention to our tools,
    rather than how they are developed and deployed, we fail to understand our reality.
    We become trapped, merely describing the technological world on its own terms
    and making it even harder to untangle the effects of digital technologies and
    our everyday experiences. By encouraging us to pay closer attention to this world-making
    capacity, with its potential to harm and heal, Stiegler is showing us what else
    is possible. There are other ways of living, of being, of evolving. It is technics,
    not technology, that will give the future its new face.
