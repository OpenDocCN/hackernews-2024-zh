- en: When I started working from home in the late 1980s as a freelance technical
    writer, I was clearly an outlier. Even contractors mostly went into the office
    in those days. Over time, though, that slowly changed, and the pandemic — along
    with generationally shifting views on work-life balance — accelerated worker sentiment
    away from going into a formal office every day, even if some CEOs wish it weren’t
    so.

    is expected to [increase to 20% by next year](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/),
    according to data published by USA Today. In total, 58% of white-collar employees
    want flexibility in their work schedules to work at home a few days a week, per
    that same USA Today data. Yet, we are continually getting post-pandemic mixed
    messages about returning to the office.

    the notion of a digital HQ during the pandemic, began [preaching about a return
    to the office](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/19/benioffs-reported-slack-statement-muddles-message-about-salesforces-view-of-wfh/),
    blaming working from home for lack of productivity, especially among new employees.

    toward working in the office. Some have suggested that it’s because these companies
    have invested heavily in office buildings and need people to fill them. Maybe
    it’s just a need to have the employees in front of managers for control purposes,
    or they genuinely believe that workers are more productive in the office. Whatever
    the reason, they seem quite committed to getting back to the office.

    (return to office mandates) for power grabbing and blaming employees for poor
    performance. We provide evidence that RTO mandates hurt employee satisfaction
    but do not improve firm performance,” the report found.

    Group, who has studied and written extensively about remote work, says she was
    surprised to find that workers tended to value flexibility over place; it wasn’t
    so much where you needed to be, so much as your ability to control when you worked,
    to maintain a proper work-life balance.

    who have some degree of flexibility over where and when they work are reporting
    higher levels of employee engagement. That is the group of people that is demonstrating
    to be more engaged and more productive,” she said.'

    to the office are unsurprisingly having to deal with more employee burnout. “The
    argument so many times behind this return to office mandate is that employees
    will be more productive because we can collaborate in person and, and things get
    done. Well, being burnt out and sustaining a burnout level is the opposite of
    being more productive,” she said.

    access to a much broader and diverse employee base than you could get from one

    all sorts of talent. Whereas before we insisted all employees must be local or
    must be in the city, now we’ve opened it up more broadly, and we got way better
    candidates. We don’t ever want to go back and we’re going to open that up permanently,’”
    said Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research who has been watching
    this trend for a long time.

    in the office and for what reasons. There are many tech companies that are leaving
    it up to their employees to decide where they want to work, and it seems to work
    quite well.

    it was founded a decade ago. Other tech companies with a flexible approach include
    Dropbox, Atlassian and Okta, none of which require a specific number of days in

    Hinchcliffe says this is part of a shift to a decentralized workplace where startups
    in particular avoid the regular overhead of having an office. Instead they often
    rent space in the WeWork model to get together with customers, press and analysts,
    or each other, as needed.

    environments is new hires out of college, who benefit from being in an office.
    “When you have new-hire employees, especially early in their career, they do ramp
    up faster and report a better experience with a lower degree of burnout when they
    can come into a place where there are other people to help them,” she said, giving
    some credence to what Benioff was saying.

    when there is value in getting together for team building, to meet customers or
    to collaborate and brainstorm in person, but in spite of the cries from big CEOs,
    employees have tasted this flexibility, and it’s going to be hard to get the genie
    back in the bottle. For now, it continues to be a debate between labor and management
    about where and how work gets done.
