    final rule that, effective June 25, 2028, will firmly cement the dominance of
    unhealthy blue-pump LED light bulbs. We must reverse this decision before it is

    energy, according to the DOE. As a consequence, healthy light bulbs are ranked
    lower when lumens per watt are used as the regulatory standard. This makes it
