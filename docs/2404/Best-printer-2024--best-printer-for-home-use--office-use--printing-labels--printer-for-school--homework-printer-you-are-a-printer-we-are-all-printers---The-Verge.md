It’s been over a year since I last [told you to just buy a Brother laser printer](/23642073/best-printer-2023-brother-laser-wi-fi-its-fine), and that article has fallen down the list of Google search results because I haven’t spent my time loading it up with fake updates every so often to gain the attention of the Google search robot.

It’s weird because the *correct answer* to the query “what is the best printer” has not changed, but an [entire](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-printer/) [ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/best-home-printer/) of [content](https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/technology/best-printers-for-small-businesses) [farms](https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/small-and-home-office/best-printer) seems [motivated](https://people.com/best-home-printers-6747787) to [constantly](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/product-reviews/tech/g25317506/best-printers/) [update](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-all-in-one-printer/) [articles](https://www.thespruce.com/best-home-printers-7372664) about [printers](https://www.cbsnews.com/essentials/best-all-in-one-printers/) in response to [the incentive structure](/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai) created by [that robot’s obvious preferences](/2023/10/26/23931825/google-search-local-seo-thai-food-near-me-maps). [Pointing out that incentive structure](/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization) and the [culture that’s developed](/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results) around it seems to make a lot of [people mad](/2023/11/1/23942564/googles-danny-sullivan-responds-to-our-piece-about-the-culture-of-seo-hustlers), which is also interesting!

Anyway, here’s the best printer for 2024: a Brother laser printer. You can just pick any one you like; I have one with a sheet feeder and one without a sheet feeder. Both of them have reliably printed return labels and random forms and pictures for my kid to color for years now, and I have never purchased replacement toner for either one. Neither has fallen off the WiFi or insisted I sign up for an ink-related hostage situation or required me to consider the ongoing schemes of HP executives who seem determined to make people hate a legendary brand with [straightforward cash grabs](/2024/3/2/24088867/hp-all-in-plan-printer-rental-instant-ink) and [weird DRM ideas](/2023/5/25/23736811/hp-plus-printer-ink-drm-firmware-update-cant-cancel).

I am including a box with buttons to buy a Brother laser printer; the buttons kick us back small affiliate fees if you press them and buy a printer. Don’t feel compelled to do it; my only ask is that you make this article go viral by sharing it in faux-outrage that the EIC of *The Verge* has published an article partially generated by AI, because after the buttons I am going to include a bunch of AI-generated copy from Google’s Gemini in order to pad this thing out.

Brother laser printers are strong contenders in the market, but they might not be the absolute “best” for everyone. Here’s a breakdown of why Brother laser printers are popular and some things to consider:

Ultimately, the best printer depends on your specific needs and priorities. Consider your printing volume, color requirements, budget, and available space to make an informed decision. Brother laser printers are strong contenders, especially for black and white printing needs, but weigh the pros and cons against other options like inkjets before deciding.
