    and local ready-mix producer [Boston Sand & Gravel](https://www.bostonsand.com/)
    report they are the first to place concrete with Sublime Systems'' zero-carbon
    cement in a mud mat for a building. Turner would not disclose the specific site
    due to the client''s desired confidentiality, but said it is in the greater Boston
    area and within ready-mix truck distance from the BS&G facilities.'

    Sublime Systems'' CEO. "It really was the culmination of a lot of effort to see
    it not just being done for testing''s sake, but actually, replacing cement that
    would otherwise have been the carbon intensive variety."'

    Institute of Technology and pioneered by Ellis, with co-founder Yet-Ming Chiang,
    an MIT professor also involved in a similar technology startup, [the iron-air
    battery producer Form Energy.](https://www.enr.com/articles/56478-novel-w-va-iron-air-battery-plant-building-team-is-named)

    Sublime's cement-making technology can be fueled by renewable electricity and
    its processes allow electrons to break the ingredients down at room temperature,
    rather than the traditional way of producing portland cement by heating limestone
    and clay, mixed with iron ore or fly ash, in a kiln up to 2,700°F.

    that may not be made in a fossil-fueled kiln that gives you a certain crystalline
    composition," Ellis says.'

- en: David Robb, a Turner estimator and the preconstruction manager on the Boston-area
    project, says there was nothing out of the ordinary about the concrete placement
    on the project and that the material provided by BS&G using Sublime's cement was
    tested for temperature and slump when it arrived in ready-mix trucks just as it
    would have been on any other project.

- en: The placement is being used by Sublime to validate several key aspects of the
    performance of its cement in concrete in a commercial project. While only a small
    quantity of Sublime's cement was used on the project, it was mixed into a ready-mix
    concrete truck, maintained workability during transit, was poured out of the concrete
    truck into a boom pump and pumped through the boom and a series of rubber hoses
    and finally placed and finished in its final location on-site to set as hardened
    concrete. All firsts for the material.

    planned design strength. A mud mat is a layer of concrete beneath a structural
    concrete floor or footing over softer, wetter soil.

    to inform him of any good opportunities to pilot a product with Sublime cement.
    In late January, a mud mat placement on a job with Turner self-performing as concrete
    contractor and Boston Sand & Gravel as the vendor came together.

    catalyze its commercial-scale, zero cement manufacturing technology March 25\.
    The award [from the department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED)](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector)
    will be used for the construction of Sublime’s first commercial manufacturing
    plant in Holyoke, Mass., the company said.
