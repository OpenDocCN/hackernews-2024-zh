    that no one is looking over his or her shoulder but has to do their job so well
    that they can steal for months or years and it won’t show up. They have to be
    charismatic and knowledgeable enough so that no one bothers to double check their
    work. They have to be very steady in their work so that it cannot be reviewed
    because they are on vacation or ill…in short, they have to be great employees.
    And either so boring that all ignore their existence or so well liked that no
    one would question their character. Most choose the latter mode since it also
    allows access to more accounts and financial secrets.

  zh: 我的意思是，弄明白这一点。一个贪污犯不仅要把自己的工作做好，以至于没人监视他们，还必须把工作做得如此出色，以至于可以偷窃数月甚至数年而不被察觉。他们必须富有魅力和知识，以至于没有人会再次检查他们的工作。他们必须在工作中非常稳定，以至于不能被审核，因为他们在度假或生病……简而言之，他们必须是出色的员工。要么无趣到所有人忽略他们的存在，要么深受喜爱，以至于没有人会质疑他们的品格。大多数选择后者的方式，因为这也允许访问更多的账户和财务机密。

    I found it incredible that such brilliant and attractive people would be dumb
    enough to risk it all for the relatively paltry gains that embezzlement can earn.

    or later and that pattern is usually repeated over and over.

- en: Take one of my favorite embezzlers, a guy who once owned the famous Flamingo
    Hotel in California until his world crumbled around him during a case our client
    brought against him in the late 1970’s. I had represented a minority shareholder
    in the venture and after perhaps a year of very aggressive litigation, Eddie Chan
    (not his real name) called it quits, transferred the shell of a company that was
    left to my client along with most of the rest of his assets, settled for a suspended
    sentence with the district attorney (to my fury) and then called me to invite

- en: The waiters all knew him. He was a regular and his waistline showed it. Friendly
    but not effusive, soft-spoken and understated, he appeared now as he had been
