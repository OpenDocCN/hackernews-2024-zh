- en: We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent
    feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage
    closely with the entire ecosystem. It's also critical that the CMA has sufficient
    time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA
    has asked market participants to provide by the end of June. Given both of these
    significant considerations, we will not complete third-party cookie deprecation
    during the second half of Q4.

    conclude that process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision
    proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year.
