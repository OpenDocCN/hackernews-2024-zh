**ASD-STE100** **Simplified Technical English**  (**STE **for short) is a **controlled natural language** to write technical documentation.

English is the international language of science, technology and human relations. It is also the language of the aerospace and defense industry. However, it is not often the native language of the readers of technical documentation. Many readers have a limited knowledge of English. Complex sentence structure and the large number of meanings and synonyms that many English words have can cause confusion.

STE was created in the late 1970s by the **European Association of Aerospace Industries** (AECMA) in cooperation with the **Aerospace Industries Association of America** (AIA), upon request from the **Association of European Airlines** (AEA). The goal was to make aircraft maintenance documentation more readable for those with limited knowledge of English. The resulting **AECMA Simplified English Guide** was released in **1986** and later became an international standard: **ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English**.

Today, the success of STE is such that other industries use it beyond its original intended purpose of aerospace maintenance documentation. Interest in the STE standard has also increased dramatically in the areas of language services, professional translation and interpreting, as well as in the academic world.
