- en: A new USC-led study on rats that feasted on a high-fat, sugary diet raises the
    possibility that a junk food-filled diet in teens may disrupt their brains’ memory
    ability for a long time.

    that if these rats grew up on this junk food diet, then they have these memory
    impairments that don’t go away,” said Scott Kanoski, a professor of biological
    sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “If you just
    simply put them on a healthy diet, these effects unfortunately last well into
    adulthood.”

    Anna Hayes considered that [prior research](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/6/1816)
    has shown a link between poor diet and Alzheimer’s disease. People who suffer
    from Alzheimer’s disease tend to have lower levels of a neurotransmitter called
    acetylcholine in the brain that is essential for memory and functions such as
    learning, attention, arousal and involuntary muscle movement.

- en: The team wondered what this could mean for younger people who may be on a similar
    fat-filled, sugary Western diet, particularly during adolescence when their brain
    is undergoing significant development. By tracking the impact of the diet on the
    rats’ levels of acetylcholine and running the rats through some memory testing,
    they could learn more about the important relationship between diet and memory.

    sugary diet and in a control group of rats by analyzing their brain responses
    to certain tasks designed to test their memory. The team examined the rats’ brains
    post-mortem for signs of disrupted acetylcholine levels.

    Days later, the researchers reintroduced the rats to the scene that was nearly
    identical except for the addition of one new object. Rats on the junk food diet
    showed signs they could not remember which object they had previously seen, and
    where, while those in the control group showed familiarity.

    events, analogous to ‘episodic memory’ in humans that allows us to remember events
    from our past,” lead author Hayes explained. “That signal appears to not be happening
    in the animals that grew up eating the fatty, sugary diet.”

    when important changes are occurring in development. “I don’t know how to say
    this without sounding like Cassandra and doom and gloom,” he said, “but unfortunately,
    some things that may be more easily reversible during adulthood are less reversible
    when they are occurring during childhood.”

- en: There is at least some hope for intervention. Kanoski said that in another round
    of the study, the research team examined whether the memory damage in rats raised
    on the junk food diet could be reversed with medication that induces the release
    of acetylcholine. They used two drugs, PNU-282987 and carbachol, and found that
    with those treatments given directly to the hippocampus, a brain region that controls
    memory and is disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease, the rats’ memory ability was restored.

    needed to know how memory problems from a junk food diet during adolescence can
    be reversed.
