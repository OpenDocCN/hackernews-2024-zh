  zh: 关注政策强制的价格可负担性而不是供应似乎是一种“民间经济学”的表达——人们直观地理解经济学的方式。对于住房而言，“民间经济学”与可观察和可测量的现实在某种程度上有很大偏差，而这种偏差在其他市场上并不存在。
- en: '[Nall, Elmendorf, and Oklobdzija, found that](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459):
    ‘30%-40% of Americans believe, contrary to basic economic theory and robust empirical
    evidence, that a large, exogenous increase in their region’s housing stock would
    cause rents and home prices to rise.’'

  zh: '[Nall、Elmendorf 和 Oklobdzija 发现](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266459)：“30%
    - 40% 的美国人相信，与基本经济理论和强有力的实证证据相反，他们所在地区的住房库存大幅增加将导致租金和房价上涨。”'

    easier to imagine a supply shock causing a price rise or fall in oil, and subsequently
    in petrol prices. Maybe the infrequency of house purchases and the emotional connection
    to our own homes is the cause of the distortion.

  zh: 或许这只是房地产流动性差的表现。很容易想象供给冲击引起油价上涨或下跌，随后是汽油价格上涨。也许房屋购买频率低和对自家房屋的情感联系是扭曲的原因。

    like tractor production figures, or can start to notice the large queues outside
    the bakery. There is a housing famine.

- en: We have tried demand subsidies, as have many of our peer nations, time and time
    again — in guises as varied as Help to Buy, affordability criteria, shared ownership
    and targeted ISAs. Yet we still have one of the worst housing affordability crises
    in the world. What conclusion should we draw from this?

  zh: 我们尝试过需求补贴，像许多同行国家一样，一次又一次 —— 在像购房援助、负担能力标准、共有产权和有针对性的ISA等多种形式中。然而，我们仍然面临世界上最严重的住房负担能力危机之一。我们应该从中得出什么结论呢？
