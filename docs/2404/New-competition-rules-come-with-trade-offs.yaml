- en: There’s an active debate in some countries about whether to adopt new rules
    that single out a handful of leading technology services. While these prescriptive
    laws seek to promote competitive digital markets, they can involve trade-offs
    that raise prices and limit choice for consumers and businesses. We wanted to
    share some of the concerns we’re hearing following changes we’ve made to comply
    with Europe’s recently enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA).

- en: Under the DMA, we’ve had to remove useful Google Search features for flights,
    hotels and local businesses. This means that if you search for a flight in Europe,
    we can no longer show a full array of information about carriers, flight times
    and prices. This benefits a small number of online travel aggregators, but harms
    a wider range of airlines, hotel operators and small firms who now find it harder
    to reach customers directly.

- en: We introduced these types of Google Search features to help consumers, making
    it easier for people to access accurate information. There’s now more friction
    when you search for a flight on Google in Europe. And there’s a greater risk that
    you’ll end up on a travel website advertising a low fare that jumps just before
    you make a purchase, with a message like “this fare is no longer available.”

    that direct booking clicks are down as much as 30% since our compliance changes
    were implemented. These businesses now have to connect with customers via a handful
    of intermediaries that typically charge large commissions, while traffic from
    Google was free. European airlines and local businesses have [expressed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/airlines-hotels-warn-google-changes-may-benefit-large-intermediaries-2024-03-06/)

- en: We’ve always been focused on improving Google Search to help people quickly
    and easily find what they’re looking for. We developed [Google Images](https://blog.google/products/search/18-years-after-google-images-versace-jungle-print-dress-back/)
    to show a photo instead of just a link to a photo. We launched [Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/look-back-15-years-mapping-world/)
    to help you find a local business, not just websites that mention its address.
    And we developed ways to make it easy for people to directly connect with airlines,
    hotels, and merchants, saving time and money. These features also help a lot of
    independent companies, including small businesses, compete with large, successful
    websites.

    competition policy. We encourage other countries contemplating such rules to consider
    the potential adverse consequences — including those for the small businesses
    that don’t have a voice in the regulatory process.

    and the effects of overly rigid product mandates. In our view, the best approach
    would ensure consumers can continue to choose what services they want to use,
    rather than requiring us to redesign Search for the benefit of a handful of companies.
