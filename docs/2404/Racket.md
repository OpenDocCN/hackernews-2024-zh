# Racket

> 来源：[https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/)

Racket comes with a comprehensive suite of libraries: [a cross-platform GUI toolbox](https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/), a [web server](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/index.html?q=%23lang%20web), and more. [Thousands of additional packages](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org) are a [single command](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pkg/getting-started.html?q=raco%20pkg#%28part._installing-packages%29) away: 3D graphics, a bluetooth socket connector, color maps, data structures, educational software, games, a quantum-random number generator, scientific simulations, web script testing, and many more.

Macros work with these tools. The example <abc class="disappear-if-smartphone">on the left</abc> <abc class="smartphone-only">above</abc> shows the implementation of a small number-guessing game. It is implemented in the GUI dialect of Racket, and demonstrates a number of language features.
