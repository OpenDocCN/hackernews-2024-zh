    the stainless steel Tesla Cybertruck seems like an all-around mess. We cover a
    lot of those concerns here on Jalopnik, but if you want an even clearer picture
    of just how dire owners of this machine have it, look no further than the Cybertruck
    owners forums.

    by @salsadrunkard that featured a screenshot of a Cybertruck owner detailing how
    their truck broke down a mile from the delivery center. It didn’t take much digging
    to find the forum and [the thread](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/worst-delivery-in-my-life-truck-died-in-5-minutes.14042/)
    itself on Cybertrucks Owners Club. The initial post reads:'

    error, flashing red screen, pulled off side of highway now the truck is dead and
    I’m waiting for a tow truck. Dealer couldn’t do anything for me. It was great
    for 5 minutes.. tried everything, restarting, screen is stuck black and keeps
    beeping

    dangerous! It’s a joke that there’s no rearview camera display where the rear
    view is, instead, it’s a tiny display on your main screen that shows you behind.
    So stupid. Cost cutting.

    to press the brake to put it in reverse and everything went black. Power door
    button wouldn’t even let me out, had to use manual release to get out. I can not
    get back in either. My battery is at 40%, so no it’s not dead. Has anyone had
    this problem?
