Despite being reachable in multiple well-known libraries or\n> programs, it proved rarely exploitable. Indeed, this was not a foos bug:\n> with hard-to-achieve preconditions, it did not even provide a nice\n> primitive. On PHP however, it lead to amazing results: a new\n> exploitation technique that affects the whole PHP ecosystem, and the\n> compromission of several applications.\n> \n> This talk will first walk you through the discovery of the bug and its\n> limitations, before describing the conception of several remote binary\n> PHP exploits, and through them offer unique insight in the internal of\n> the engine of the web language, and the difficulties one faces when\n> exploiting it.\n> \n> BIO\n> Charles Fol, also known as cfreal, is a security researcher at LEXFO /\n> AMBIONICS. He has discovered remote code execution vulnerabilities\n> targeting renowned CMS and frameworks such as Drupal, Magento, Symfony\n> or Laravel, but also enjoys binary exploitation, to escalate privileges\n> (Apache, PHP-FPM) or compromise security solutions (DataDog's Sqreen,\n> Fortinet SSL VPN, Watchguard). He is the creator for PHPGGC, the go-to\n> tool to exploit PHP deserialization, and an expert in PHP internals.\n\nThe event is on May 10-11th, so in 3 weeks from now.\n\nAlexander\n\n```"]
