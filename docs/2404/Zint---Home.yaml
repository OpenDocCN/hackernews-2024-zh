- en: The Zint project aims to provide a complete cross-platform open source barcode
    generating solution. The package currently consists of a Qt based GUI, a CLI command
    line executable and a library with an API to allow developers access to the capabilities
    of Zint. It is hoped that Zint provides a solution which is flexible enough for
    professional users while at the same time takes care of as much of the processing
    as possible to allow easy translation from input data to barcode image.
