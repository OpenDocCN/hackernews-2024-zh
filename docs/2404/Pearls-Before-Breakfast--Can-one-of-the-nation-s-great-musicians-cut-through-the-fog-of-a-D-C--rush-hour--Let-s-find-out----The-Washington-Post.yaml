    repeated in dozens of variations to create a dauntingly complex architecture of

    thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created,

    him; he hadn’t seen a recent photo, and besides, for most of the time Picarello
    was pretty far away. But he knew this was not a run-of-the-mill guy out there,
    performing. On the video, you can see Picarello look around him now and then,
    almost bewildered.

    to be a concert musician. But he gave it up at 18, when he decided he’d never
    be good enough to make it pay. Life does that to you sometimes. Sometimes, you
    have to do the prudent thing. So he went into another line of work. He’s a supervisor
    at the U.S. Postal Service. Doesn’t play the violin much, anymore.

    actually see that on the video. Picarello walks up, barely looking at Bell, and
    tosses in the money. Then, as if embarrassed, he quickly walks away from the man
    he once wanted to be.'

    second “Chaconne.” And that also was the first time more than one person at a
    time was listening. As Picarello stood in the back, Janice Olu arrived and took
    up a position a few feet away from Bell. Olu, a public trust officer with HUD,
    also played the violin as a kid. She didn’t know the name of the piece she was
    hearing, but she knew the man playing it has a gift.

    deal with likely outcomes. The most widely held assumption was that there could
    well be a problem with crowd control: In a demographic as sophisticated as Washington,
    the thinking went, several people would surely recognize Bell. Nervous “what-if”
    scenarios abounded. As people gathered, what if others stopped just to see what
    the attraction was? Word would spread through the crowd. Cameras would flash.
    More people flock to the scene; rush-hour pedestrian traffic backs up; tempers
    flare; the National Guard is called; tear gas, rubber bullets, etc.'

    near the very end. For Stacy Furukawa, a demographer at the Commerce Department,
    there was no doubt. She doesn’t know much about classical music, but she had been
    in the audience three weeks earlier, at Bell’s free concert at the Library of
    Congress. And here he was, the international virtuoso, sawing away, begging for
    money. She had no idea what the heck was going on, but whatever it was, she wasn’t
    about to miss it.
