    filled the house at Boston’s stately Symphony Hall, where merely pretty good seats
    went for $100\. Two weeks later, at the Music Center at Strathmore, in North Bethesda,
    he would play to a standing-room-only audience so respectful of his artistry that

    it. “If you shaved off a millimeter of wood at any point, it would totally imbalance
    the sound.” No violins sound as wonderful as Strads from the 1710s, still.

    hotel room in Vienna but was quickly returned. The second time, nearly 20 years
    later, it was pinched from his dressing room in Carnegie Hall. He never got it

    repeated in dozens of variations to create a dauntingly complex architecture of

    to be a celebration of the breadth of human possibility.
