- en: In the beginning, taking advantage of existing GCP-provided services to launch
    a start-up made total sense. Building core services like container registry, block
    storage, load balancers, or key management would‚Äôve only gotten in the way of
    building a product.

- en: Moving to bare metal gets us the margins required to build a profitable business
    but, even disregarding cost, relying on a single infrastructure  provider is a
    huge technical risk. ‚ÄúHow often does GCP fail though?‚Äù You  may ask.  Enough to
    warrant an entire [blogpost](https://blog.railway.app/p/gcp-incidents) on the
    subject!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GCP service that continues to cause the most problems for us is Key Management
    Service (KMS). And, while the dependency still technically exists, our usage of
    KMS has been greatly reduced, making migrating away almost trivial.

- en: Railway is all about making it easy for users to deploy code. These deployments
    often require configuration values like API keys and database credentials to be
    available. Railway solves this with [Service Variables](https://docs.railway.app/reference/variables#service-variables),
    which are automatically injected into deployments at runtime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since these values often contain sensitive information, they get encrypted prior
    to storage in our Postgres database. Until now, these encryption operations have
    been done by calling KMS directly.

  prefs:

    and is actually what KMS is designed for. (Yes, we were holding it wrong.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Envelope encryption is the practice of encrypting plaintext data ‚Äî like variables
    ‚Äî with a data encryption key (DEK), then encrypting the DEK with a key encryption
    key (KEK).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This reduces the surface area of an attack by allowing each user (or Railway
    project) to use separate encryption keys. Using locally generated data keys also
    means less reliance on an external key management service. Precisely what we‚Äôre
    after!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned, KMS is designed for envelope encryption and is the reason for
    its maximum input size of  `64KiB` (enough to encrypt a large DEK). We knew this
    when implementing variable encryption, but since 99% of variables fit within the
    maximum size (about the length of a 10,000 word blogpost), it made sense to use
    KMS directly to get feature out the door.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Envelope encryption eliminates the need call KMS hundreds of times for large
    batches of variables by requiring only one data encryption key (DEK) for the entire
    batch. We simply generate one DEK per [Environment](https://docs.railway.app/guides/environments)
    (an isolated instance of a project, like production or staging) and use it for
    all encryption operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DEK is generated locally (256-bit [AES using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
    [GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)), encrypted once using
    KMS, then stored on the `Environment` data model. We created a helper utility
    to handle encryption, decryption, and key generation, and attached it to our request
    context, which has a lifetime of the current HTTP request or background job.

    decrypts the necessary DEK once and caches it in memory for further operations,
    reducing  the 100+ trips to KMS to 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There‚Äôs some other magic in here though. Did you notice that `decrypt()` doesn‚Äôt
    require a DEK? How does that work?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the requirements for envelope encryption was the ability to easily rotate
    keys. As we‚Äôve seen, the DEK is stored on the `Environment` model, but how would
    we rotate it if needed? We‚Äôd either have to store a list of old keys to try during
    the encryption process, or re-encrypt all variables and update the database inside
    a potentially huge database transaction.

    key next to the encrypted value (cipher text). For us, this meant serializing

- en: Variable decryption with this setup can be done by decrypting the DEK using
    KMS (if not already cached in memory) and using it to decrypt the variable locally
    (without KMS). It also makes passing around encrypted values easier because the
    associated `Environment` or DEK doesn‚Äôt need to go along for the ride.
  prefs: []

    but we still had to convert over 3 million existing variables to the new system.
  prefs: []

    to support both legacy and envelope encryption simultaneously, allowing us to
    progressively upgrade over 3 million variables.

    using KMS, but replacing it with something like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
    can now be done incrementally by repeating the above migration steps to rotate
    the DEKs for each environment.

    data is always a scary task. Migrating sensitive data is even worse! But, as it
    goes, even the most daunting work can be broken down into manageable chunks, which
    is how we lived to tell this tale.
