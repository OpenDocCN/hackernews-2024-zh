- en: With the approval and publication of version 1.0, the ISO confirms that the
    SCI Specification is a reliable, fair, and comparable protocol for measuring and
    reducing software's carbon footprint. The latest version 1.1 of the SCI Specification
    is now available and can be accessed [here](https://sci.greensoftware.foundation/).

    said Sanjay Podder, Responsible AI CTO and Lead for Tech Sustainability Innovation
    at Accenture, and Chairperson of the GSF. "This achievement unlocks the potential
    to achieve industry-wide adoption of the SCI Specification, which is crucial in
    empowering organizations to achieve real-world emissions reductions."'

- en: Applying the SCI Specification enables users and developers to make informed
    choices regarding tools, architectures, and services by incorporating carbon usage
    considerations, ultimately driving the adoption of more environmentally sustainable
    practices within the technology sector.

    or offsets into its calculations. Instead, it emphasizes genuine efforts to reduce
    carbon emissions.

- en: By adopting the SCI Specification, ICT and Technology companies gain access
    to a standardized protocol to assess their software for emissions reduction opportunities.
    This landmark development enables organizations to demonstrate their commitment
    to quality, efficiency, and reliability in green software development.

    sustainable innovation within the technology industry," added Henry Richardson,
    Senior Analyst at WattTime and Co-chair of the Standards Working Group at the
    GSF. "And, hopefully, is another indicator for how important collective contributions
    from the opensource community are to scale green software."'

- en: Technology sustainability is a shared responsibility, and having the right set
    of tools is crucial for realizing SCI specifications at scale. "We are also making
    it easy to calculate SCI scores using tools such as the Impact Framework," added
    Navveen Balani, Co-chair of the Standards Working Group and Impact Framework at
    the GSF. "We envision that SCI measurement will become a standard part of every
    developer’s toolbox and the norm in the future."
