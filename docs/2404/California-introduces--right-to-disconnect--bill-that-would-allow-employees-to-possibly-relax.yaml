    quiet quitting, strikes — the news (and likely your schedule) is filled with markers
    that workers are overwhelmed and too much is expected of them. There''s little
    regulation in the United States to prevent employers from forcing workers to be
    at their desks or on call at all hours, but that might soon change. California
    State Assemblyman Matt Haney has introduced AB 2751, a "right to disconnect" proposition,
    [*The San Francisco Standard* reports](https://sfstandard.com/2024/04/01/haney-bill-right-to-disconnect/).'

- en: The bill is in its early stages but, if passed, would make every California
    employer lay out exactly what a person's hours are and ensure they aren't required
    to respond to work-related communications while off the clock. Time periods in
    which a salaried employee might have to work longer hours would need to be laid
    out in their contract. Exceptions would exist for emergencies.

    of $100 for wrongdoing — whether that's forcing employees to be on Zoom, their
    inbox, answering texts or monitoring Slack when they're not getting paid to do
    so. "I do think it’s fitting that California, which has created many of these
    technologies, is also the state that introduces how we make it sustainable and
    update our protections for the times we live in and the world we’ve created,"
    Haney told *The Standard*.

    major economic center, the bill has the potential to create tremendous impact
    for workers in California, and pressure other states to follow suit. The bill
    follows similar legislation in other countries. In 2017, France became the first
    nation to [implement a "right to disconnect" policy](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/telework-and-the-french-right-to-disconnect/),
    a model which has been copied in Argentina, Ireland, Mexico and Spain.
