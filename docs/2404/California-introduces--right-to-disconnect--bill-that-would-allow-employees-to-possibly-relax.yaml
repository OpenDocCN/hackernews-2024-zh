    quiet quitting, strikes — the news (and likely your schedule) is filled with markers
    that workers are overwhelmed and too much is expected of them. There''s little
    regulation in the United States to prevent employers from forcing workers to be
    at their desks or on call at all hours, but that might soon change. California
    State Assemblyman Matt Haney has introduced AB 2751, a "right to disconnect" proposition,
    [*The San Francisco Standard* reports](https://sfstandard.com/2024/04/01/haney-bill-right-to-disconnect/).'

    — 新闻（很可能也是你的日程表）充斥着员工不堪重负和期望过高的迹象。在美国，几乎没有法规可以阻止雇主强迫员工随时待命或者待在办公桌前，但这种情况可能很快会改变。加利福尼亚州议员马特·哈尼提出了AB
    2751号法案，一个“断开连接的权利”提案，[*旧金山标准报*报道](https://sfstandard.com/2024/04/01/haney-bill-right-to-disconnect/)。'
- en: The bill is in its early stages but, if passed, would make every California
    employer lay out exactly what a person's hours are and ensure they aren't required
    to respond to work-related communications while off the clock. Time periods in
    which a salaried employee might have to work longer hours would need to be laid
    out in their contract. Exceptions would exist for emergencies.

  zh: 该法案目前处于早期阶段，但如果通过，将要求每个加利福尼亚雇主明确规定员工的工作时间，并确保他们不必在下班时间回复工作相关的通讯。薪资员工可能需要加班工作的时间段需要在他们的合同中列明。紧急情况除外。
- en: The Department of Labor would monitor adherence and fine companies a minimum
    of $100 for wrongdoing — whether that's forcing employees to be on Zoom, their
    inbox, answering texts or monitoring Slack when they're not getting paid to do
    so. "I do think it’s fitting that California, which has created many of these
    technologies, is also the state that introduces how we make it sustainable and
    update our protections for the times we live in and the world we’ve created,"
    Haney told *The Standard*.

  zh: 劳工部门将监督公司的遵守情况，并对违规行为处以最低100美元的罚款 — 无论是强迫员工在Zoom上工作，处理收件箱，回复短信还是在非工作时间监控Slack。“我认为加利福尼亚州正在创造许多这些技术的州，也是提出如何使其可持续并更新我们生活和我们创造的世界保护的州，这是非常合适的”，哈尼告诉*标准*。
- en: It's not clear how much support exists for AB 2751, but as a tech hub and a
    major economic center, the bill has the potential to create tremendous impact
    for workers in California, and pressure other states to follow suit. The bill
    follows similar legislation in other countries. In 2017, France became the first
    nation to [implement a "right to disconnect" policy](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2020/08/telework-and-the-french-right-to-disconnect/),
    a model which has been copied in Argentina, Ireland, Mexico and Spain.

  zh: 尚不清楚AB 2751号法案获得了多少支持，但作为一个技术中心和一个主要的经济中心，这项法案有可能对加利福尼亚的工人产生巨大影响，并促使其他州效仿。该法案仿效了其他国家的类似立法。2017年，法国成为首个实施“断开连接”政策的国家，这一模式已被阿根廷、爱尔兰、墨西哥和西班牙效仿。
