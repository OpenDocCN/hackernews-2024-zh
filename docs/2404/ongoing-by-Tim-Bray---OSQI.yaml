    (let’s just say **#XZ**) launched the train of thought that led me to this idea.
    If you read the story, it becomes obvious that the key vulnerability wasn’t technical,
    it was the fact that a whole lot of Open-Source software is on the undermaintained-to-neglected
    axis, because there’s no business case for paying people to take care of it. Which
    is a problem, because there is a *strong* business case for paying people to attack
    it.
