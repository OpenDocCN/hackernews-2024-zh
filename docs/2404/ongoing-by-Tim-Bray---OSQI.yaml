    OSQI is a public-sector organization that employs software engineers. Its mission

    (let’s just say **#XZ**) launched the train of thought that led me to this idea.
    If you read the story, it becomes obvious that the key vulnerability wasn’t technical,
    it was the fact that a whole lot of Open-Source software is on the undermaintained-to-neglected
    axis, because there’s no business case for paying people to take care of it. Which
    is a problem, because there is a *strong* business case for paying people to attack
    it.

    the lack of resources supporting crucial Open-Source infrastructure, but then
    and especially, the demonstration that the attackers are numerous, skilled *and
    patient*. We already knew about numerous and skilled but this episode, where the
    attacker was already well-embedded in the project [by May 2022](https://www.mail-archive.com/xz-devel@tukaani.org/msg00562.html),
    opened a few eyes, including mine.
