- en: Meanwhile, neighborhoods such as the Western Addition, Mission, Russian Hill
    and Noe Valley are chock-full of homes built before everyday people owned automobiles,
    according to San Francisco Heritage President Woody LaBounty. Many of these homes,
    constructed pre-1910, were built to have a half story of open space underneath
    to get the house off the ground and away from the muddy, sandy streets of the
    era.

- en: Once automobile ownership became commonplace, companies began turning those
    empty basement-level half-stories into garages, explaining why so many San Francisco
    garages have steep, declining driveways and shallow roofs, according to LaBounty.
    About a third of San Francisco homes were built before garages were widespread,
    LaBounty estimates.

- en: Many of the driveway parkers The Standard spoke with had alternative uses for
    their garage space. One teen, who declined to give their name, explained that
    their family had converted the garage into a relaxation zone so they could have
    a refuge from their younger siblings. David Turner, meanwhile, said he had a home
    gym set up in the garage, outfitted with a bench press, squat rack, heavy bag
    and pullup bar.
