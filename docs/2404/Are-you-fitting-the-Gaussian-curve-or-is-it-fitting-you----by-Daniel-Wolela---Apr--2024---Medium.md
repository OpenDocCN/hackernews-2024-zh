# Are you fitting the Gaussian curve or is it fitting you?

Fitting-in

In both mathematics and spirituality, there’s a fascinating echo of balance. The Central Limit Theorem in statistics illustrates how outcomes often converge around the mean, a concept mirrored by regression models emphasizing average relationships. While these mathematical ideas are grounded in data analysis, they metaphorically align with spiritual teachings that advocate for a middle path in life. This parallel underscores a universal theme: finding equilibrium, whether in understanding data patterns or in navigating life’s complexities, is often a powerful starting point for understanding both data patterns and navigating life’s complexities.

However, an overemphasis on balance can also limit our potential. This would mean:

*   Making just as much money as most people your age,
*   Being as fit as most people your age,
*   Being as confident,
*   Being as productive,
*   Being as creative, etc.,

then do what most of the people do, and harmonize things, ‘find the right balance,’ live according to Gaia¹.

But if you want to be great, then it’s not about fitting into that Gaussian curve; it’s about first: **Finding what you want to be great at**. For example, say you want to be a great dad — that’s too abstract, I know, so let’s tease out the qualities that make a great father:

1.  Spend a lot of time with your children.
2.  Send them to great schools, from KG to Uni.
3.  Be able to afford to send them to private health care.
4.  Be able to travel with them and show them what this great world has to offer. And more.

Now, figure out what this costs you, not just in terms of money but in life in general, and then optimize for that — and pay the price.

In short, it’s not always about finding the right balance; sometimes, it’s more so about finding the right imbalance and paying the ultimate sacrifice for keeping it that way.

The balance minimizes cost/sacrifice/risk, delivers medium satisfaction, medium joy, and medium fulfillment.

The imbalance maximizes cost/risk, delivers maximum satisfaction, and maximum fulfillment.
