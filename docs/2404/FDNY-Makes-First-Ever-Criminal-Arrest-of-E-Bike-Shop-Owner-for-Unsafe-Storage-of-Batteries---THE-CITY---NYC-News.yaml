- en: For the first time in their campaign to stamp out e-bike battery fires, the
    Fire Department Friday filed criminal charges against an e-bike shop owner who
    has repeatedly faced civil summons for allegedly selling illegal uncertified batteries
    and charging the potentially explosive batteries in an unsafe manner.

    1239 Flatbush Ave. in Flatbush, Brooklyn, arresting and handcuffing the store
    owner, Tian Liang Liu. The charges, including reckless endangerment, relate to
    fire code violations due to the unsafe storage and charging of batteries.

    violating laws related to e-bike batteries. Until now the FDNY and the Department
    of Consumer and Worker Protection have strictly relied on hitting store owners
    with civil penalties. In most cases, those only carry minimal financial penalties.

    a disturbing trend that has skyrocketed since the number of micro-mobility devices
    mushroomed during the pandemic. More than 660 e-bike battery fires have erupted
    across the city since 2019, killing 28 New Yorkers and injuring 400 more.

    occurred in February with the death of Fazil Khan, 27, a reporter at [The Hechinger
    Report](https://hechingerreport.org/). Fire marshals determined an e-bike battery
    exploded inside a third-floor unit of a Harlem apartment building where six men
    who are food delivery workers lived and spread thick black smoke throughout the
    building. Khan’s death was attributed to heat injuries and smoke inhalation.

    and repair shops after a lithium-ion battery fire in a Chinatown e-bike shop killed
    four residents living above the shop.

    shop’s owner, A&D NYC Inc., with a summons for selling or leasing illegal uncertified
    batteries. Starting last September the city outlawed the sale of these batteries,
    requiring that all batteries be certified as safe by a consumer safety group such
    as UL Listed.

    hitting A&D NYC Inc. with yet another summons.
