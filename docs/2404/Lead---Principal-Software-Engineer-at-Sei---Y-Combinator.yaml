    and culture of the company. We are a pre-product-market fit company, so expect
    things to move fast (not a cliche) and change directions as we twist and turn

    so far (side projects, open-source contributions, blogs, etc.). We don’t care
    about degrees, the institutions you went to, or the companies you worked for before.
    We are open to talking as long as you have put in the reps, good judgment and
    clarity, align with our values, and have a strong track record of thoughtful work.

    We have intentionally kept meetings to a bare minimum, so people can get into
    their zones and be productive. But if this gets you distracted and you commit
    half-assed things, then we might not be the right fit for you.

    have conflicting opinions on how things should be done, but at the end of the
    day we disagree and still commit to doing the things that move the company forward.
