    that anything worth having has its price. People who respect themselves are willing
    to accept the risk that the Indians will be hostile, that the venture will go
    bankrupt, that the liaison may not turn out to be one in which *every day is a
    holiday because you’re married to me.* They are willing to invest something of
    themselves; they may not play at all, but when they do play, they know the odds.

- en: 'That kind of self-respect is a discipline, a habit of mind that can never be
    faked but can be developed, trained, coaxed forth. It was once suggested to me
    that, as an antidote to crying, I put my head in a paper bag. As it happens, there
    is a sound physiological reason, something to do with oxygen, for doing exactly
    that, but the psychological effect alone is incalculable: it is difficult in the
    extreme to continue fancying oneself Cathy in *Wuthering Heights* with one''s
    head in a Food Fair bag. There is a similar case for all the small disciplines,
    unimportant in themselves; imagine maintaining any kind of swoon, commiserative
    or carnal, in a cold shower.'

    ones. To say that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton is not to say
    that Napoleon might have been saved by a crash program in cricket; to give formal
    dinners in the rain forest would be pointless did not the candlelight flickering
    on the liana call forth deeper, stronger disciplines, values instilled long before.
    It is a kind of ritual, helping us to remember who and what we are. In order to
    remember it, one must have known it.

- en: 'To have that sense of one''s intrinsic worth which, for better or for worse,
    constitutes self-respect, is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate,
    to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself,
    paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference. If we do not respect ourselves,
    we are on the one hand forced to despise those who have so few resources as to
    consort with us, so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal weaknesses.
    On the other, we are peculiarly in thrall to everyone we see, curiously determined
    to live out—since our self-image is untenable—their false notions of us. We flatter
    ourselves by thinking this compulsion to please others an attractive trait: a
    gift for imaginative empathy, evidence of our willingness to give. *Of course*
    we will play Francesca to Paolo, Brett Ashley to Jake, Helen Keller to anyone''s
    Annie Sullivan: no expectation is too misplaced, no rôle too ludicrous. At the
    mercy of those we can not but hold in contempt, we play rôles doomed to failure
    before they are begun, each defeat generating fresh despair at the necessity of
    divining and meeting the next demand made upon us.'

  zh: 拥有那种对自身内在价值的感知，无论好坏，都构成了自尊，这潜在地意味着拥有一切：辨别能力，爱与漠不关心的能力。缺少这种感知则意味着被困在自己内部，自相矛盾地无法既爱也漠不关心。如果我们不尊重自己，一方面我们不得不鄙视那些资源稀少以至于与我们交往，感知力如此之低以至于对我们致命弱点视而不见的人。另一方面，我们却特别受制于我们看到的每个人，好奇地决定去实现——因为我们的自我形象站不住脚——他们对我们的错误看法。我们自以为是，认为这种取悦他人的冲动是一种迷人的特质：一种富有想象力的同情心的礼物，是我们愿意付出的证据。*当然*我们会成为弗朗西斯卡给保罗，布雷特·阿什利给杰克，海伦·凯勒给任何安妮·沙利文的角色：没有期望是太错误，没有角色是太荒谬。在我们不得不鄙视的人的摆布之下，我们扮演着注定在开始之前就注定失败的角色，每一次失败都会在我们预测和满足下一个对我们的需求的必要性时，产生新的绝望。
- en: 'It is the phenomenon sometimes called *alienation from self.* In its advanced
    stages, we no longer answer the telephone, because someone might want something;
    that we could say *no* without drowning in self-reproach is an idea alien to this
    game. Every encounter demands too much, tears the nerves, drains the will, and
    the spectre of something as small as an unanswered letter arouses such disproportionate
    guilt that one''s sanity becomes an object of speculation among one''s acquaintances.
    To assign unanswered letters their proper weight, to free us from the expectations
    of others, to give us back to ourselves—there lies the great, the singular power
    of self-respect. Without it, one eventually discovers the final turn of the screw:
    one runs away to find oneself, and finds no one at home.'

  zh: 有时被称为*对自我的疏离*的现象。在其高级阶段，我们不再接电话，因为某人可能想要什么；我们可以毫不内疚地说*不*的想法对这场游戏是陌生的。每一次相遇都要求太多，撕裂神经，耗尽意志，而即使是不回复的信件的幽灵也会引发如此不成比例的内疚感，以至于一个人的理智成为他的熟人中的猜测对象。赋予未回复的信件应有的重视，使我们摆脱他人的期望，使我们重新回到自己身上——这就是自尊的伟大、独特的力量所在。没有它，最终会发现螺丝的最后一转：我们逃离寻找自己，却发现家门紧闭。
