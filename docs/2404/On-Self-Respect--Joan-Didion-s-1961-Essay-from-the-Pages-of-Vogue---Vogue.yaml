    that anything worth having has its price. People who respect themselves are willing
    to accept the risk that the Indians will be hostile, that the venture will go
    bankrupt, that the liaison may not turn out to be one in which *every day is a
    holiday because you’re married to me.* They are willing to invest something of
    themselves; they may not play at all, but when they do play, they know the odds.

    faked but can be developed, trained, coaxed forth. It was once suggested to me
    that, as an antidote to crying, I put my head in a paper bag. As it happens, there
    is a sound physiological reason, something to do with oxygen, for doing exactly
    that, but the psychological effect alone is incalculable: it is difficult in the
    extreme to continue fancying oneself Cathy in *Wuthering Heights* with one''s
    head in a Food Fair bag. There is a similar case for all the small disciplines,
    unimportant in themselves; imagine maintaining any kind of swoon, commiserative
    or carnal, in a cold shower.'

    ones. To say that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton is not to say
    that Napoleon might have been saved by a crash program in cricket; to give formal
    dinners in the rain forest would be pointless did not the candlelight flickering
    on the liana call forth deeper, stronger disciplines, values instilled long before.
    It is a kind of ritual, helping us to remember who and what we are. In order to
    remember it, one must have known it.

    constitutes self-respect, is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate,
    to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself,
    paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference. If we do not respect ourselves,
    we are on the one hand forced to despise those who have so few resources as to
    consort with us, so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal weaknesses.
    On the other, we are peculiarly in thrall to everyone we see, curiously determined
    to live out—since our self-image is untenable—their false notions of us. We flatter
    ourselves by thinking this compulsion to please others an attractive trait: a
    gift for imaginative empathy, evidence of our willingness to give. *Of course*
    we will play Francesca to Paolo, Brett Ashley to Jake, Helen Keller to anyone''s
    Annie Sullivan: no expectation is too misplaced, no rôle too ludicrous. At the
    mercy of those we can not but hold in contempt, we play rôles doomed to failure
    before they are begun, each defeat generating fresh despair at the necessity of
    divining and meeting the next demand made upon us.'

    stages, we no longer answer the telephone, because someone might want something;
    that we could say *no* without drowning in self-reproach is an idea alien to this
    game. Every encounter demands too much, tears the nerves, drains the will, and
    the spectre of something as small as an unanswered letter arouses such disproportionate
    guilt that one''s sanity becomes an object of speculation among one''s acquaintances.
    To assign unanswered letters their proper weight, to free us from the expectations
    of others, to give us back to ourselves—there lies the great, the singular power
    of self-respect. Without it, one eventually discovers the final turn of the screw:
    one runs away to find oneself, and finds no one at home.'
