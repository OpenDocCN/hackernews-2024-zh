# NixOS Wiki - NixOS Wiki

> 来源：[https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_Wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/NixOS_Wiki)

This is the official NixOS Wiki. It includes topics not covered in the [NixOS Manual](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual): NixOS user guides, configuration examples, and troubleshooting tips.

NixOS is a Linux operating system based on the Nix package manager and the Nixpkgs package repository.

Newcomers to NixOS are encouraged to read the [Nix Core Ecosystem](/wiki/Nix_Ecosystem "Nix Ecosystem") overview article to get a comprehensive orientation. For more specific introductions, see:

If you want to try Nix standalone in another Linux distribution or on a Mac, take your first steps on [nix.dev](https://nix.dev).

A lot of people use [Home manager](/wiki/Home_manager "Home manager") for managing the contents of their home directory, many use [Flakes](/wiki/Flakes "Flakes") instead of the NixOS bi-annually release channels. Both add complexity and you may not even need them. Begin with NixOS, and only integrate Home Manager and/or Flakes into your setup once you're confident with NixOS and comprehend their significance.
