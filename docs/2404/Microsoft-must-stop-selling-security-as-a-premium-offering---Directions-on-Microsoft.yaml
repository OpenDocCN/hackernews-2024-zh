- en: In a perfect world, Microsoft would take security seriously again. It would
    be transparent about breaches. Its execs would stop gloating about increasing
    security service revenue at a time when Microsoft can’t secure its own employees,
    let alone customers, against incidents that are happening with increasing frequency.
    And Microsoft would include must-have security capabilities as part of existing
    subscriptions instead of selling them as add-ons.

- en: Selling security as a premium offering helped Microsoft build security into
    a self-proclaimed $20 billion USD per year business (as of January 2023). Making
    Microsoft 365 E5 a prerequisite to obtain core security tools is one part of Microsoft’s
    security growth strategy. Another is to make certain security tools available
    only as add-ons on top of its Microsoft 365 E5 subscription.

    to pay more and more every year for Microsoft’s latest top-shelf security services
    — which keep moving to higher and higher shelves,” according to *Directions on

- en: Some organizations are choosing to license all of their knowledge workers with
    Microsoft 365 E5, which costs $57 USD per user per month, because E5 includes
    all the capabilities of E3 and adds most (but not all) of Microsoft’s top-shelf
    security and compliance service. There is risk in only partially licensing an
    organization for E5, since security and compliance tools are typically enabled
    across the entire Microsoft 365 tenancy and rarely perform license enforcement
    at a per-user level.

    of a la carte security and compliance pieces and adding them to less expensive
    Microsoft 365 E3 or Office 365 E3 subscriptions.

- en: This approach may have made financial sense for some orgs but doesn’t add up
    now. For several years, Microsoft offered two add-ons, Microsoft 365 E5 Security
    and Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance ($12 USD each), as a way for organizations to
    bring E3 users into license compliance without paying the full price of E5\. But
    due to price increases implemented in 2022 for almost all Office 365 and Microsoft
    365 suites, it is now more expensive to license users for the security and compliance
    capabilities via the two legacy add-ons instead of just licensing Microsoft 365
    E5, which has not changed price in some time.

    features part of more of its subscriptions. It did make a couple of concessions
    on that front after a couple of much-publicized attacks last year.

    Midnight Blizzard to attack Microsoft in 2023\. While OAuth-based applications
    have become more common and are now increasingly being exploited to breach organizations,
    Microsoft has offered limited tools to help with oversight, and has been requiring
    Microsoft 365 E5 to use any of them.

    customers last year, Microsoft’s faced complaints about some of its security-upselling
    practices. Logging information that would have allowed detection of the incident
    was only available to those Microsoft 365 customers who purchased the premium
    E5 plan. Those running E3 were unable to see the required logging information.

- en: Microsoft officials pledged to make logging more broadly available, and in Oct.,
    2023, increased audit logging for Purview Audit (Standard) to 180 days from the
    original 90 days. For customers generally licensed with Microsoft 365 E3 (or less),
    this means that once logs are optimally configured, customers have 180 days to
    analyze the logged events for malicious actors before those events are lost entirely.
    But if customers want a longer period of logging, they still need to add Purview
    Audit (Premium) for one year of retention, and the 10-year Audit Log Retention
    add-on for up to 10 years of retention.
