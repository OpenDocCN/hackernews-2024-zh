# 'I'm always rejected at airport e-gates – so the Passport Office suggested changing my name'

[*Gill Charlton*](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/g/gf-gj/gill-charlton/) *has been fighting for* Telegraph *readers and solving their travel problems for more than 30 years, winning refunds, righting wrongs and suggesting solutions. *

Here is this week’s question:

## Dear Gill,

I am a British citizen living in [Portugal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/portugal/). For some reason my old passport wasn’t being accepted at airport [e-gates](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/frictionless-travel-facial-recognition-airport-e-gates/) to enter the UK. I have renewed my passport but the problem persists when entering the UK. 

Immigration officers only ask where I’m travelling from as they put my passport in a scanner. When I ask why I have been rejected by the e-gates, I’m told either that they have different software to that being used by the e-gates, or that it’s because I have a common name.

When I phoned the Passport Office to discuss the problem, an officer said that perhaps I should consider changing my name!

Can you help me get some answers?

## Dear David,

If the reason is simply that you have a common name then surely there would be thousands of John Smiths and Peter Joneses with similar complaints. The ePassport gates work in part by using facial recognition technology to compare the faces of passengers to the images held on their biometric ePassports. Additional biographical and security checks are also conducted by Border Force officers using monitors behind the scenes. This explains why it sometimes takes longer to pass through the gates. You can also be rejected if you have grown facial hair, lost or gained a lot of weight or now wear glasses.

I contacted the Home Office on David’s behalf and was told it would not discuss individual cases for security reasons. I then asked David to put in a Freedom of Information request to see if we could find out more. This proved equally frustrating. The Border Force’s Information Rights Team simply said there are a number of “technical and security reasons” why David’s passport wasn’t accepted and it couldn’t be more specific as disclosure might prejudice law enforcement. 

In an age when I can open my iPhone using facial recognition while wearing sunglasses and a hat, it shouldn’t be beyond the scope of the Border Force’s IT system to flag up that this David Clark is good to enter the UK having been checked manually on a previous visit.

David is not alone. A poll of my friends uncovered three men who have similar issues. One had been told, unofficially, that he shared a name with someone on a “watch list”. 

The Border Force’s IT system clearly isn’t fit for purpose. In February, David Neal, Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, published a withering report after a re-inspection of ePassport gates at three UK airports. He found the latest IT upgrade had resulted in “poor management of Home Office records” resulting in even more passengers being referred due to “inaccurate historical data not being cleansed from records”.
