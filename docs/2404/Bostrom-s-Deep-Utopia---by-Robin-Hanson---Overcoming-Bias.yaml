- en: Nick Bostrom’s new tome … has a great cover with a number of interesting questions
    and a subtitle that hints that it might address the meaning of life in a future
    where AI and robots can do everything. But alas, after much build up and anticipation,
    he leaves that question unanswered, with an abrupt oops, out of time on page 427\.
    … He tries to address meaty topics like, what keeps life interesting?  What is
    our purpose and meaning when the struggle is gone?  Can fulfillment get full?
    But in each case, the pedagogy is more of a survey of all possible answers versus
    the much more difficult task of making specific predictions. ([More](https://twitter.com/FutureJurvetson/status/1773054722901180596))

    You wouldn’t have to work anymore. You could get any luxury you wanted by raising
    an eyebrow. … for “Deep Utopia,” Bostrom smartly chose to imagine … that A.I.
    does exactly what we ask it to do. … Although he says we’re not cut out for perfection,
    Bostrom does explore ways that life in utopia could be made bearable after all.
    … Bostrom … sees the book as an exploration of the A.I. future, not a conclusion
    about it. … He likened the book to a particle accelerator that smashes atoms together
    to study their parts, such as quarks. In “Deep Utopia,” he said, he smashed values
    into one another to study their composition. ([More](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/05/opinion/ai-jobs-nick-bostrom.html))

- en: In his new book *[Deep Utopia](https://nickbostrom.com/deep-utopia/)*, Nick
    Bostrom asks how creatures very much like him might want to live for eons if they
    had total peace, vast wealth, and full eternal control of extremely competent
    AI that could do everything better than they. He mostly tries to list as many
    sensible possibilities as possible.

    impression that it is pretty hard to imagine compelling utopias, though I think
    he does help clarify some of his life goals.

    of creatures vastly more capable than us I’m far more interested in what those
    better creatures would do than in what a creature like me now might do there.
    And I find the idea of creatures like me long being rich, at peace, and in full
    control of such a world quite [unlikely](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1779571114403876877).

- en: Furthermore, in whatever actual future scenarios end up being the closest to
    his hypothetical, I just don’t believe that creatures at our level of ability
    there would have values much like Bostrom’s values today. Bostrom asks his question
    about people pretty close to him, leftist academics in rich Western societies.
    Others in our world [today](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/world-value-drift),
    or folks from past civs, would find much less in his book on how to fulfill *their*
    desires in his hypothetical scenario. After all, Bostrom says little about honor,
    of enjoying the lamentations of those you conquer, or of having “descendants as
    numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore.”

    that, as aliens must be very smart, they’d be communists. But it seems crazy to
    expect a stance less than a century old to feel central to aliens a billion years
    more advanced. Similarly, a great many futurists try to imagine crazy advanced
    technology and social institutions in the context of cultural values quite close
    to their own, even if little like those values around here existed even a few
    centuries ago.

    institutions, and the universe, it can be even harder to imagine future cultures.
    But I can assure you, they will change, *a lot.*
