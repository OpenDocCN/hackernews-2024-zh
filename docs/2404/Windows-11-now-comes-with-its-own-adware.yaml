    it to be ad-free, but those days are apparently *finito*. The latest update to
    Windows 11 ([KB5036980](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&featureId=text-link&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy90b3BpYy9hcHJpbC0yMy0yMDI0LWtiNTAzNjk4MC1vcy1idWlsZHMtMjI2MjEtMzUyNy1hbmQtMjI2MzEtMzUyNy1wcmV2aWV3LTVhMGQ2YzQ5LWU0MmUtNGViNC04NTQxLTMzYTcxMzkyODFlZCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiM2IwYzQ2YmEtODRjMi00MzQxLThkYWMtNjk1YzdlMjk3YmY0In0&signature=AQAAAdhNBXaQ9tuJlBLHXl1STb1KVXyf5q_vbP_H1PK5QIa9&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftopic%2Fapril-23-2024-kb5036980-os-builds-22621-3527-and-22631-3527-preview-5a0d6c49-e42e-4eb4-8541-33a7139281ed))
    comes out this week and includes ads for apps in the "recommended" section of
    the Start Menu, one of the most oft-used parts of the OS.

    according to the release notes. "These apps come from a small set of curated developers."'

- en: The app suggestions are enabled by default, but you can restore your previously
    pristine Windows experience if you've installed the update, fortunately. To do
    so, go into Settings and select Personalization > Start and switch the "Show recommendations
    for tips, app promotions and more" toggle to "off."

- en: The new "feature" arrives just weeks after it [appeared as an Insider beta](https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-windows-11-beta-testers-may-start-seeing-ads-in-the-start-menu-032358394.html),
    showing how quickly Microsoft can implement things when it wants to. It certainly
    wasn't enough time to receive the kind of user feedback the Insider program is
    designed for.

- en: The update is bound to rub customers the wrong way, considering that Windows
    11 starts at $139 for the Home version. While removing it isn't a huge deal, it
    may also remind folks of the needless time they spent stripping bloatware from
    OEM Windows installations. Microsoft previously tested ads in the Windows 11 File
    Explorer, but ended the experiment shortly afterward.
