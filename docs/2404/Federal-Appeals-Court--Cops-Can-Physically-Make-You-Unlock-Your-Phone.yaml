    devices now have some of the most advanced encryption technology in existence
    to keep that information safe from prying eyes. The easiest way around that, of
    course, is for someone to gain access to your phone.

    your phone, even by physically forcing you to press your thumb against it.

    by two California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers over his car's window tinting.
    When asked, Payne admitted that he was on parole, which the officers confirmed.
    After finding Payne's cellphone in the car, officers unlocked it by [forcibly
    pressing his thumb against it](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24555465-usa-v-jeremy-travis-payne-mts?responsive=1&title=1)
    as he sat handcuffed. (The officers claimed in their arrest report that Payne
    "reluctantly unlocked the cell phone" when asked, which Payne disputed; the government
    later accepted in court "that defendant's thumbprint was compelled.")

    same day, which appeared to show "several bags of blue pills (suspected to be
    fentanyl)." After checking the phone's map and finding what they suspected to
    be a home address, the officers drove there and used Payne's keys to enter and
    search the residence. Inside, they  found and seized more than 800 pills.

    Payne's attorneys argued that by forcing him to unlock his phone, the officers
    "compelled a testimonial communication," violating both the Fourth Amendment's
    protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee
    against self-incrimination. Even though the provisions of his parole required
    him to surrender any electronic devices and passcodes, "failure to comply could
    result in 'arrest pending further investigation' or confiscation of the device
    pending investigation," not the use of force to make him open the phone.

    the motion to suppress, and Payne pleaded guilty. In November 2022, he was [sentenced](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24555469-usa-v-jeremy-travis-payne-sentencing?responsive=1&title=1)
    to 12 years in prison. Notably, Payne had only served three years for the crime
    for which he was on parole—assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer.

    has "a significantly diminished expectation of privacy," and even though the conditions
    of his parole did not require him to "provide a biometric identifier," the distinction
    was insufficient to support throwing out the search altogether.

    that police needed a warrant before drawing a suspect's blood.

    and parcel with establishing their identity. Nearly half of U.S. states [require

    identity—it's a window into their entire lives. Even cursory access to someone's
    phone can turn up travel history, banking information, and call and text logs—a
    treasure trove of potentially incriminating information, all of which would otherwise
    require a warrant.

    of "writs of assistance," general warrants used by British authorities in the
    American colonies that allowed government agents to enter homes at will and look
    for anything disallowed. As a result, the Fourth Amendment requires search warrants
    based on probable cause and signed by a judge.

    not be read to extend to all instances where a biometric is used to unlock an
    electronic device." But, he adds, "the outcome…may have been different had [the
    officer] required Payne to independently select the finger that he placed on the
    phone" instead of forcibly mashing Payne''s thumb into it himself.'
