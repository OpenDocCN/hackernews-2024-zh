    as he sat handcuffed. (The officers claimed in their arrest report that Payne
    "reluctantly unlocked the cell phone" when asked, which Payne disputed; the government
    later accepted in court "that defendant's thumbprint was compelled.")

  zh: 2021年11月，杰里米·佩恩（Jeremy Payne）因车窗膜过黑被加利福尼亚州两名高速公路巡警（CHP）拦截。当被问及时，佩恩承认自己正在假释期间，这一点得到了确认。在车内发现了佩恩的手机后，警察在他被戴上手铐的情况下通过[强制按压他的大拇指](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24555465-usa-v-jeremy-travis-payne-mts?responsive=1&title=1)来解锁它。（警方在逮捕报告中声称佩恩“不情愿地在被要求时解锁了手机”，但佩恩对此提出了异议；政府后来在法庭上承认“被告的指纹是被强迫性地取得的”。）
- en: The officers searched through Payne's camera roll and found a video taken the
    same day, which appeared to show "several bags of blue pills (suspected to be
    fentanyl)." After checking the phone's map and finding what they suspected to
    be a home address, the officers drove there and used Payne's keys to enter and
    search the residence. Inside, they  found and seized more than 800 pills.

    "compelled a testimonial communication," violating both the Fourth Amendment's
    protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee
    against self-incrimination. Even though the provisions of his parole required
    him to surrender any electronic devices and passcodes, "failure to comply could
    result in 'arrest pending further investigation' or confiscation of the device
    pending investigation," not the use of force to make him open the phone.

- en: Searches "incident to arrest" are an [accepted part](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-4/search-incident-to-arrest-doctrine)
    of Fourth Amendment precedent. Further, Tallman wrote that as a parolee, Payne
    has "a significantly diminished expectation of privacy," and even though the conditions
    of his parole did not require him to "provide a biometric identifier," the distinction
    was insufficient to support throwing out the search altogether.

  zh: 但是强制获取某人手机的访问权限不仅仅是获取其身份，而是窥视其整个生活的窗口。即使对某人手机的初步访问也可以找到旅行记录、银行信息以及通话和短信记录——这些都是潜在的证据信息宝库，而这些信息通常需要搜查令才能获取。
