- en: Generative AI, which uses data lakes and question snippets to recover patterns
    and relationships, is becoming more prevalent in creative industries. However,
    the legal implications of using generative AI are still unclear, particularly
    in relation to copyright infringement, ownership of AI-generated works, and unlicensed
    content in training data. Courts are currently trying to establish how intellectual
    property laws should be applied to generative AI, and several cases have already
    been filed. To protect themselves from these risks, companies that use generative
    AI need to ensure that they are in compliance with the law and take steps to mitigate
    potential risks, such as ensuring they use training data free from unlicensed
    content and developing ways to show provenance of generated content.
