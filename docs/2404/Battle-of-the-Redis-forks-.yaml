    open-source licensing for its free core product last week, throwing an established
    community of contributors into turmoil. (It is swapping the BSD for a more restrictive
    dual-license under the Redis Source Available License and MongoDB’s Server Side
    Public License.)

    troops around it – in the way that a Terraform community has largely gathered
    around OpenTofu after Hashicorp’s August 10, 2023 “poison pill” decision to impose
    a more restrictive licence – is an open question.

    likely that a serious Redis fork could be on the cards. If AWS and Alibaba Cloud
    throw their considerable weight behind employees who have been significant contributors
    to the popular project (not to mention other potential sponsors), it could just
    take off. Watch this space…
