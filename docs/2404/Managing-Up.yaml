    Altman proposed the concept of  “[Moore’s Law For Everything](https://moores.samaltman.com/?ref=wheresyoured.at)”

    an “American Equity Fund” where companies are forced to give up a percentage of

    Altman’s worldview as one where the only thing that can save mankind is making
    startups, and those startups should be funded in the way that Altman likes. And
    this piece feels a lot like everything in Altman’s universe — it never actually
    connects Moore’s Law to anything, which, I should add, isn’t so much a law as
    an observation that has long ceased to be relevant as the shrinkage of transistors
    has slowed in recent years. In many respects, this comparison is eerily prophetic,

    process that might actually solve them, you’re fundamentally disconnected from
    any real value creation. Silicon Valley is atrophying as a result of lazy, disconnected
    venture capitalists and power players elevating men like Sam Altman to positions
    of power, and incumbents helping career consultants dictate the actions of those
    who actually build software and hardware.

    those before creating yet another growth-centric investor-friendly doodad.

    who have failed upwards just because they say the right things.
