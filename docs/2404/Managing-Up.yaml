    itself. Systrom allegedly didn’t want to leave the company, but felt that Zuckerberg

    an “American Equity Fund” where companies are forced to give up a percentage of

    masquerading as a technologist.  A charming, capricious, abusive and untrustworthy
    man that has proven time and time again that his only reliable trait is that whatever
    happens must benefit Sam Altman.

    and why OpenAI has been so unashamed in steamrolling and plagiarizing the entire
    world. Altman has created nothing other than wealth for himself and his closest
    allies, helping elevate and protect existing power structures and the ideologies
    of men like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and LinkedIn founder and career manager
    Reid Hoffman.

    When the center of attention at a company isn’t really on the product but the
    idea of what the product could do, very little about a company’s culture is focused
    on building useful things for real people. When leadership is dominated by managers
    that haven’t touched a line of code in decades, nobody steering the ship has the
    ability to judge whether software is good, or useful, or valuable.

    While Prabhakar Raghavan may be a decorated computer scientist and academic, he
    arguably oversaw the destruction of Yahoo, formerly one of the web’s most dominant
    search engines, and failed upwards into a managerial role that allowed him to
    take over — and now arguably ruin — Google’s search product, chasing away Ben
    Gomes, a man responsible for actually building things. Adam Mosseri was and always
    will be a manager making calls about products he has had no hand in building,
    and has architected the outright destruction of a social network used by billions
    of people.

    and upsetting those he works with, is on course to become the most toxic manager
    of them all. If left unchecked, OpenAI will perpetuate one of the largest thefts
    in history, looting the internet and using it to train models that have yet to
    prove their necessity other than as a symbol that Silicon Valley can still innovate.

    and making vague promises that the people who do the actual work at OpenAI likely
    know they can’t keep.

    called “[the worst product he’d ever reviewed](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131078/mkbhd-calls-the-humane-ai-pin-the-worst-product-ive-ever-reviewed?ref=wheresyoured.at).”

    process that might actually solve them, you’re fundamentally disconnected from
    any real value creation. Silicon Valley is atrophying as a result of lazy, disconnected
    venture capitalists and power players elevating men like Sam Altman to positions
    of power, and incumbents helping career consultants dictate the actions of those
    who actually build software and hardware.
