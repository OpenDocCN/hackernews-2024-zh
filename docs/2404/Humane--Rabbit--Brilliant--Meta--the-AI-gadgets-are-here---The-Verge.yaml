    a new technological era. That sounds grandiose, I know, but in the next few weeks,
    a whole new generation of gadgets is poised to hit the market. Humane will launch
    [its voice-controlled AI Pin](/24084444/humane-ai-pin-hands-on). [Rabbit’s AI-powered
    R1](/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date) will start
    to ship. Brilliant Labs’ [AI-enabled smart glasses](/2024/2/9/24067485/frame-ai-smart-glasses-brilliant-labs)
    are coming out. And Meta is rolling out [a new feature to its smart glasses](/2024/3/28/24114454/meta-ai-ray-ban-smart-glasses-launch)
    that allow Meta’s AI to see and help you navigate the real world.'

- en: There are many more AI gadgets to come, but the AI hardware revolution is officially
    beginning. What all these gadgets have in common is that they put artificial intelligence
    at the front of the experience. When you tap your AI Pin to ask a question, play
    music, or take a photo, Humane runs your query through a series of language models
    to figure out what you’re asking for and how best to accomplish it. When you ask
    your Rabbit R1 or your Meta smart glasses who makes that cool mug you’re looking
    at, it pings through a series of image recognition and data processing models
    in order to tell you that’s a Yeti Rambler. AI is not an app or a feature; it’s
    the whole thing.

    user experience and feature list that this month will feel both like the day you
    got your first flip phone *and* the day the iPhone made that flip phone look like
    an antique. But probably not. More likely, what we’re about to get are a lot of
    new ideas about how you interact with technology. And together, they’ll show us
    at least a glimpse of the future.

- en: The primary argument against all these AI gadgets so far has been that the smartphone
    exists. Why, you might ask, do I need special hardware to access all this stuff?
    Why can’t I just do it on the phone in my pocket? To that, I say, well, you mostly
    can! [The ChatGPT app](/2023/5/18/23728703/openai-chatgpt-app-ios) is great, [Google’s
    Gemini](/2023/12/6/23990466/google-gemini-llm-ai-model) is rapidly [taking over
    the Android experience](/2024/2/8/24065553/google-gemini-ios-android-app-duet-bard),
    and if I were a betting man, I’d say there’s a whole lot of AI coming to iOS this
    year.

- en: Smartphones are great! None of these devices will kill or replace your phone,
    and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. But after so many years of using
    our phones, we’ve forgotten how much friction they actually contain. To do almost
    anything on your phone, you have to take the device out of your pocket, look at
    it, unlock it, open an app, wait for the app to load, tap between one and 40,000
    times, switch to another app, and repeat over and over again. Smartphones are
    great because they’re able to contain and access practically everything, but they’re
    not actually particularly efficient tools. And they’re not going to get better,
    not as long as the app store business model stays the way it is.

- en: The promise of AI — and I want to emphasize the word *promise* because nothing
    we’ve seen so far comes remotely close to accomplishing this — is to abstract
    all those steps and all that friction out of existence. All you need to do is
    declare your intentions — play music, navigate home, text Anna, tell me what poison
    ivy looks like — and let the system figure out how to get it done. Your phone
    contains multitudes, but it’s not really optimized for anything. An AI-optimized
    gadget can be easier to reach, quicker to launch, and alert to your input at all
    times.

- en: If that pans out, we might get not only a new set of gadgets but also a new
    set of huge companies. Google and Apple won the smartphone wars, and no company
    over the last decade has even come close to upsetting that app store duopoly.
    So much of the race to augmented reality, the metaverse, wearables, and everything
    else has been about trying to open up a new market. (On the flip side, it’s no
    accident that while so many other companies are building AI gadgets, Google and
    Apple are working hastily to shove AI into your phone.) AI might turn out to be
    just another flailing attempt from the folks that lost the smartphone wars. But
    it might also be the first general-purpose, all-things-to-all-people technology
    that actually feels like an upgrade.

    with the whole “AI is not yet very good or reliable” thing. But even once we’re
    past that, all the simplicity by abstraction can actually turn into confusion.
    What if I text Anna in multiple places? What if I listen to podcasts in Pocket
    Casts and music in Spotify and audiobooks in Audible, and I have accounts with
    a bunch of other music services I never even use? What if the closest four-star
    coffee shop is a Starbucks, and I hate Starbucks? If I tell my AI device to buy
    something, what card does it use? What retailer does it pick? How fast will it
    ship? Automation requires trust, and we don’t yet have many reasons to trust AI.

    Rabbit have built complex web apps through which you can manage all your accounts,
    payment systems, conversation history, and other preferences. Rabbit allows you
    to actually teach your device how to do things the way you like. Both also have
    some kind of display — Humane, a laser projector, Rabbit, a small screen on the
    R1 — on which you can check the AI’s work or change the way it’s planning to do
    something. The AI glasses from Meta and Brilliant try to address these problems
    either by directing you to look at something on your phone or just by not trying
    to do everything for everyone. AI can’t do everything yet.

- en: In many ways, it feels like it’s 2004 again. I’d bet that none of these new
    devices will feel like a perfectly executed, entirely feature-complete product
    — even the people who make these gadgets don’t think they’ve finished the job,
    no matter how self-serious their product videos might be. But before the iPhone
    turned the whole cellphone market into panes of glass, phones swiveled; they flipped;
    they were candy bars and clamshells and sliders and everything in between. Right
    now, everyone’s searching for “the iPhone of AI,” but we’re not getting that anytime
    soon. We might not get it ever, for that matter, because the promise of AI is
    that it doesn’t require a certain kind of perfected interface — it doesn’t require
    any interface at all. What we’re going to get instead are the Razr, the Chocolate,
    the Treo, the Pearl, the N-Gage, and the Sidekick of AI. It’s going to be chaos,
    and it’s going to be great.
