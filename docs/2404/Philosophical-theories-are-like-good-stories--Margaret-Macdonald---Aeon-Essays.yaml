    This provocative remark comes from the paper ‘Linguistic Philosophy and Perception’
    (1953) by Margaret Macdonald. Macdonald was a figure at the institutional heart
    of British philosophy in the mid-20th century whose work, especially her views
    on the nature of philosophy itself, deserves to be better known.

    overly poetic or unscientific. Russell, for example, took issue with the French
    philosopher [Henri Bergson](https://aeon.co/essays/henri-bergson-the-philosopher-damned-for-his-female-fans),
    who was something of a *bête-noire* for early analytic philosophers. Bergson’s
    theorising (Russell thought) did not depend on argument but rather on expressing
    ‘truths’, so-called, arrived at by introspection. As Russell [wrote](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27900381)

    There’s no way of proving which is a better account of things, it’s simply a matter
    of which ‘image’ you like best. In other words, there’s no attempt to provide
    empirical evidence – evidence based on publicly observable data – in support of
    these views. For Russell, this was enough to show that what Bergson was doing
    was not really philosophy, at least not *good* philosophy, any more than Shakespeare’s
    plays and Shelley’s poetry were.

    shared. In her 1953 paper, she embraces comparisons between philosophy and literature,
    poetry and art. For Macdonald, philosophical theories are very much like ‘pictures’
    or ‘stories’ and, perhaps even more controversially, she suggests that philosophical
    debates often come down to ‘temperamental differences’. For example, whether you
    are willing to believe (in accordance with thinkers like René Descartes) that
    we have an immaterial soul will come down to more than just the philosophical
    arguments you are presented with. Your view on this matter, Macdonald thinks,
    will more likely be determined by your own personal values, life experiences,
    religion and so on. In this way, she thinks, temperamental differences account
    for many philosophical disagreements.

    tradition from Russell. She was, to all appearances at least, just as much a part
    of analyticphilosophy as he was. In fact, institutionally, she was at the very
    centre of things. Macdonald studied at the University of London and her PhD was
    supervised by [Susan Stebbing](https://aeon.co/essays/on-susan-stebbing-and-the-role-of-public-philosophy),
    the first woman in Britain to be appointed a full professor of philosophy. Along
    with Stebbing and others including Gilbert Ryle, Macdonald helped found *Analysis*
    – *the* academic journal of analytic philosophy – which she later edited after
    the Second World War. And throughout the 1930s and ’50s, she published many articles
    in venues like the *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*,the UK’s foremost
    philosophical society, and was an active member of Cambridge University’s Moral
    Sciences Club.

    born in 1903 into poverty to a single mother who later absconded to Australia,
    leaving her baby behind to be fostered. Macdonald was ill throughout her childhood
    and youth, suffering from tuberculosis (among other things), and supported by
    an organisation called the National Children’s Home and Orphanage that later helped
    pay for her undergraduate studies. As Michael Kremer [notes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09608788.2021.1932409),
    Macdonald’s upbringing stands in stark contrast with many of the canonical figures
    in 20th-century philosophy such as Russell, who was born into British aristocracy
    (his grandfather was an earl who was twice prime minister), Ludwig Wittgenstein,
    a member of what was, historically, an extremely wealthy family (his father Karl,
    an industrialist, was one of the richest men in Europe), or Ryle, who spent his
    entire adult life easily moving through the ranks at the University of Oxford.

    Macdonald was one of a number of women who benefitted from Stebbing’s supervision,

    College (now part of Royal Holloway, University of London) where Stebbing was

    for example, was told by Ryle that ‘everyone thinks you are the right person to
    succeed Moore, except that you are a woman’. Blunt to say the least. Similarly,
    in a letter to a friend in 1939, Macdonald writes: ‘I have been hoping to get
    a permanent lectureship in philosophy … It is difficult in my subject, especially
    for a woman.’ Nonetheless, through a pipeline from Bedford College into academic
    philosophy (and often back to Bedford College), Stebbing was able to help several

    (1939), Stebbing emphasises the importance of distinguishing between different
    uses of language – eg, the difference between descriptive and emotive language
    – not only in philosophy, but in public discourse such as politics and journalism.
    After working with Stebbing, Macdonald went to Cambridge to work on a project
    on the influence of language on the concept of ‘matter’, a topic on which Stebbing
    herself once planned to write a book.

    towering figure in 20th-century philosophy. Along with Alice Ambrose, Macdonald
    attended many of his lectures – and the two women would go on to publish the so-called
    *Blue and Brown Books*,collated from notes they took between 1932-1935\. It is
    no coincidence that, from the late 1930s onwards, Macdonald’s work often draws
    on what is known as ‘linguistic analysis’ – which is an approach to philosophy
    rather than a specific theory. Linguistic analysis was central to Wittgenstein’s
    later philosophy (and important in Ambrose’s philosophy, too).

    analysing the sorts of ways that philosophers talk and write – especially in comparison
    with scientists. This kind of linguistic analysis is a way of taking a step back
    and taking a look at the practice of philosophy itself. It involves answering
    questions like: *What do philosophical disagreements involve and what do philosophical
    theories look like?*'

    title) and, by paying attention to the language they use, offers an account of

    indirect realism (I’m going to oversimplify both here). Direct realism is the
    view that we *directly* perceive external objects in the world around us. When
    I look out of my window, I directly see a tree – and the nature of my perceptual
    experience informs me (directly) about the nature of the tree. Indirect realism,
    on the other hand, is the view that I only ever *indirectly* perceive objects
    like trees. What I directly perceive are mental representations – ie, *ideas of
    trees* – that are produced in my mind when my sense organs (eg, my eyes) are stimulated
    in the right way and send signals to my brain. I learn about the world around
    via these ideas (also known as ‘sense data’) in my mind. Direct realism might
    seem more common-sensical, but indirect realism might seem better equipped to
    deal with the existence of illusory or hallucinatory experiences, where I am seemingly
    not perceiving the world the way it really is. Given all this, isn’t it true to
    say that direct realists and indirect realists *disagree* on the facts?

    the *phenomenological* facts: facts about what it is like to have a perceptual
    experience. Both the direct realist and the indirect realist agree that, when
    I look out my window, I see a tree. What they disagree on is *what it means* to
    say that ‘I see a tree’ – they disagree on the mechanics of what is going on,
    or how best to explain the fact that I see a tree. Most importantly, for Macdonald,
    there’s no empirical test available to draw a line between the two theories. We
    can’t run an experiment to test for the truth of either theory because, on the
    level of experience, both parties agree that it’s true to say: ‘I see a tree.’'

    that would have made Russell – who tried to move philosophy as far away from the
    arts as possible – very uncomfortable. Macdonald claims that philosophy’s value
    is much closer to that of art, literature or poetry than science. She explains
    that the arts inform us that ‘Language has many uses besides that of giving factual
    information or drawing deductive conclusions.’ A philosophical theory may not
    provide ‘information in a scientific sense’, she writes, ‘but, as poetry shows,
    it is far from worthless.’

    For example, Shakespeare’s *Othello* encourages us to think about jealousy by
    making it the centrepiece of the play. Or consider the emphasis on humanity’s
    relationship with nature in Romantic poetry. In both cases, the artist has ‘zoomed
    in’ on, or ‘enlarged’, an aspect of life – in a way that it is not typically enlarged
    in real life – to encourage the audience to reflect on it.

    what is *useful.* And different philosophical theories can be useful to different
    people for different reasons (such as, Macdonald might add, their temperament).
