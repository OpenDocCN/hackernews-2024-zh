    Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities
    and "many others" resulting in serious injuries.

    of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results
    of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.

    the NHTSA report said. The system did not "sufficiently ensure driver attention
    and appropriate use."

- en: NHTSA's filing pointed to a "weak driver engagement system," and Autopilot that
    stays switched on even when a driver isn't paying adequate attention to the road
    or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including
    "nags" or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the
    wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking
    at the road.

    software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That
    update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this
    same investigation.

    vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring
    systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.
