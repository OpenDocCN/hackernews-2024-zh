    stays switched on even when a driver isn't paying adequate attention to the road
    or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including
    "nags" or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the
    wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking
    at the road.
