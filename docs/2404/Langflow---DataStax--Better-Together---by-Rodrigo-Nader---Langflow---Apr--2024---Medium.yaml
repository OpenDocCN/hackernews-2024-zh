- en: Our passion for deep learning and a shared desire for productivity led us to
    brainstorm for hours, and as we looked into the future, we were convinced that
    AI should be more than a black box. It would require fine-grained control, interactivity,
    and most importantly, safety. We bet on a hybrid approach that incorporated rule-based
    logic on top of agent decisions.

    as an open-source solution for the exploration of LLM applications. It lowered
    the entry barrier by offering a visual framework that enabled users to connect,
    create, and share components that cover everything from Prompt Chaining to RAG
    and Autonomous Agents.

    about a potential partnership. From our initial chats, we shared a lot of excitement
    about what‚Äôs possible and how the future of AI will unfold. We were clearly on
    the same page, and DataStax‚Äôs track record with Apache Cassandra, along with their
    commitment to the open-source community, resonated with us instantly. Before we
    knew it, we were hopping on a flight to San Francisco, getting ready to close
    a deal.

    so far has been pretty hectic; we handle everything from coding sessions to budget
    planning. Joining DataStax means we‚Äôll be free to focus 100% of our efforts on
    growing Langflow and sharing our inventive experiments with a broad range of researchers,
    developers, and entrepreneurs out there! And that‚Äôs what we love doing.

    and more intuitive while retaining the amount of control that coding provides.
    Our goal is to establish it as the industry standard for assembling complex, multi-agent
    workflows, making research and development not just better, but more enjoyable.'
