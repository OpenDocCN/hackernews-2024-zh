# Cally: Accessibility statement

[Cally: Accessibility statement](https://wicky.nillia.ms/cally/accessibility/) ([via](https://twitter.com/wickynilliams/status/1775208741392052299 "@wickynilliams")) Cally is a neat new open source date (and date range) picker Web Component by Nick Williams.

It’s framework agnostic and weighs less than 9KB grilled, but the best feature is this detailed page of documentation covering its accessibility story, including how it was tested—in JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver.

I’d love to see other open source JavaScript libraries follow this example.
