TAIPEI -- China's Huawei Technologies on Thursday unveiled its first artificial intelligence-powered PC, saying it will be equipped with Intel's latest chipset and run on its in-house operating system.

The announcement comes despite a U.S. clampdown on the company that has sharply restricted its access to advanced American technology.
