    [Google and Reddit announced](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/)
    a blockbuster deal that would let Google train its AI models on Reddit content.
    Google said the deal, [reportedly worth $60 million](https://www.reuters.com/technology/reddit-ai-content-licensing-deal-with-google-sources-say-2024-02-22/),
    would "facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit information," leading
    to some speculation that Google promised Reddit better visibility in exchange
    for the valuable training data. A few weeks later, [Reddit also went public](https://www.businessinsider.com/reddits-ipo-set-to-take-front-page-of-internet-public-2024-3).
