    was exponential](https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/). Indeed, things
    looked rosy back then, when we were beset with unbridled optimism for the growth
    prospects of IMGZ. After all, getting four users in one day (up from zero) can
    only rightly lead you to extrapolate to trillions of users in a month.

    retain a measly 30 users, 5 of which are friends and family, and the rest I'm
    not even sure if they even paid anything, because IMGZ costs like $10 a year so
    I really need to squint to see any money in the bank.

    pretty penny to maintain, and lately we''ve been hit by an additional calamity:
    Spam bots decided to abuse our signup system, and rack up email provider bills
    for emails sent to sign up. This increased our hosting costs tenfold, from $2/mo
    to $20/mo.'

    that doesn't sound like the first number is larger than the second number, so
    the situation sounds dire. Sure, we could all go get some high-paying job at a
    fancy FAANG firm, but then we'd have to make the compromise of having to *hide*
    how hostile we are to our users. At least the **amount** of hostility towards
    them wouldn't change, but that's a small comfort.

    use IMGZ and ask them why not. The rationale behind this is that the users who
    use IMGZ are already paying, so they have no more money left for us to extract,
    while users who aren't using IMGZ are a veritable font of untapped potential that
    can increase our valuation by $100.

    Is it the copy that tells you to get lost and never sign up for the service? Because
    we do mean that, but apparently some people have stuck around long enough to get
    Stockholm syndrome and now quite enjoy the experience. Is it the subpar image
    delivery? We could do something about that, but it sounds like too much trouble.

    up an imgz.org email address, and tell us why you aren't using the service. I'm
    sure that, out of the three people who read this post, at least one will bother.
