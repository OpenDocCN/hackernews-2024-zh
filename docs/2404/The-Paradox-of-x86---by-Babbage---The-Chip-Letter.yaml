    has evolved hugely. Today’s x86 code is 64-bit, and benefits from the addition
    of hundreds of new instructions that enhance its capabilities. Those designs have
    consistently supported a high degree of ‘backwards compatibility’. Users have
    been able to run their existing software on new designs, even as the x86 ISA has
    been evolved and been enhanced.

    processors have been shipped using the x86 ISA, generating over a trillion dollars
    in revenue for Intel. In part that’s because consumers and businesses have needed
    to buy an x86 compatible PC in order to run first MS-DOS and then Windows software.
    More recently, x86 designs have become dominant on servers as Intel’s manufacturing
    prowess, supported by large volumes of PC sales, has enabled the company to create
    powerful designs that outperformed competitors.
