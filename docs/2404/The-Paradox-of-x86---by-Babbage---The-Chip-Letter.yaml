    of processors starting with Intel’s 8086 from 1976 (hence the name x86), leading
    to today’s latest processor designs from Intel and AMD. As we saw in the Trillion

    few years.
  prefs: []

    the 8086 was an evolution of the earlier 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, which in turn
    was an evolution of Intel’s first 8-bit microprocessor the 8008, which was an
    implementation of the architecture of DataPoint 2200 terminal from 1970\.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the nearly five decades since the launch of the 16-bit 8086, the x86 ISA
    has evolved hugely. Today’s x86 code is 64-bit, and benefits from the addition
    of hundreds of new instructions that enhance its capabilities. Those designs have
    consistently supported a high degree of ‘backwards compatibility’. Users have
    been able to run their existing software on new designs, even as the x86 ISA has
    been evolved and been enhanced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And over those five decades, x86 has been enormously successful. Billions of
    processors have been shipped using the x86 ISA, generating over a trillion dollars
    in revenue for Intel. In part that’s because consumers and businesses have needed
    to buy an x86 compatible PC in order to run first MS-DOS and then Windows software.
    More recently, x86 designs have become dominant on servers as Intel’s manufacturing
    prowess, supported by large volumes of PC sales, has enabled the company to create
    powerful designs that outperformed competitors.

    other firm left making x86 designs that compete directly with Intel.

    crucial to Intel’s future would be an understatement. Put simply, Intel is building
    a lot of expensive fabs. It will use them to build its own x86 products. But to
    fill them, and ultimately make them financially viable, it needs lots of third
    party customers, and almost none of those customers will be using x86 in their

    ‘The Arm ISA’ (singular) but there are multiple current and legacy ISAs designed
    by Arm - but now extends to licensing of the ISAs themselves to third parties.
