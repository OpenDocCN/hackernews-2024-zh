- en: A preliminary caution must be noted about both parts of the term “Arabic science.”
    This is, first, because the scientists discussed here were not all Arab Muslims.
    Indeed, most of the greatest thinkers of the era were not ethnically Arab. This
    is not surprising considering that, for several centuries throughout the Middle
    East, Muslims were a minority (a trend that only began to change at the end of
    the tenth century). The second caution about “Arabic science” is that it was not
    science as we are familiar with it today. Pre-modern science, while not blind
    to utility, sought knowledge primarily in order to understand philosophical questions
    concerned with meaning, being, the good, and so on. Modern science, by contrast,
    grew out of a revolution in thought that reoriented politics around individual
    comfort through the mastery of nature. Modern science dismisses ancient metaphysical
    questions as (to borrow Francis Bacon’s words) the pursuit of pleasure and vanity.
    Whatever modern science owes to Arabic science, the intellectual activity of the
    medieval Islamic world was not of the same kind as the European scientific revolution,
    which came after a radical break from ancient natural philosophy. Indeed, even
    though we use the term “science” for convenience, it is important to remember
    that this word was not coined until the nineteenth century; the closest word in
    Arabic — *ilm* — means “knowledge,” and not necessarily that of the natural world.

  zh: 对“阿拉伯科学”一词的两点初步警告必须指出。首先，因为这里讨论的科学家并非全部是阿拉伯穆斯林。事实上，那个时代最伟大的思想家大多数都不是阿拉伯裔。考虑到在整个中东地区的几个世纪里，穆斯林是少数派（这种趋势直到十世纪末才开始改变），这并不令人惊讶。关于“阿拉伯科学”的第二点警告是，它不是我们今天熟知的科学。尽管古代科学并非对实用性视而不见，但其主要追求是为了理解关于意义、存在、善等哲学问题。相比之下，现代科学源于一场思想革命，通过掌握自然来重新定位政治，以追求个体的舒适。现代科学将古代形而上学问题视为（借用弗朗西斯·培根的话）追求快乐和虚荣的行为。无论现代科学向阿拉伯科学借鉴了多少，但中世纪伊斯兰世界的智力活动与欧洲科学革命并非同一类别，后者经历了与古代自然哲学的激烈分离。实际上，尽管我们为方便使用术语“科学”，但重要的是记住，这个词直到19世纪才被创造出来；阿拉伯语中最接近的词——*ilm*——意思是“知识”，并不一定指自然界的知识。
- en: 'Still, there are two reasons why it makes sense to refer to scientific activity
    of the Golden Age as Arabic. The first is that most of the philosophical and scientific
    work at the time was eventually translated into Arabic, which became the language
    of most scholars in the region, regardless of ethnicity or religious background.
    And second, the alternatives — “Middle Eastern science” or “Islamic science” —
    are even less accurate. This is in part because very little is known about the
    personal backgrounds of these thinkers. But it is also because of another caution
    we must keep in mind about this subject, which ought to be footnoted to every
    broad assertion made about the Golden Age: surprisingly little is known for certain
    even about the social and historical context of this era. Abdelhamid I. Sabra,
    a now-retired professor of the history of Arabic science who taught at Harvard,
    [described his field to the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html)

    Arabic civilization contributed much more to the development of science than the
    passive transmission to the West of ancient thought and of inventions originating
    elsewhere (such as the numeral system from India and papermaking from China).
    For one thing, the scholarly revival in Abbasid Baghdad (751-1258) that resulted
    in the translation of almost all the scientific works of the classical Greeks
    into Arabic is nothing to scoff at. But beyond their translations of (and commentaries

    identified smallpox and measles, writing a treatise on them that became influential
    beyond the Middle East and into nineteenth-century Europe. Rhazes was the first

    is that Rhazes was the first to seriously challenge the seeming infallibility
    of the classical physician Galen. For example, he disputed Galen’s theory of humors,
    and he conducted a controlled experiment to see if bloodletting, which was the
    most common medical procedure up until the nineteenth century, actually worked
    as a medical treatment. (He found that it did.) Rhazes provides a clear instance

- en: Like the later European Renaissance, the Arabic Golden Age also had many polymaths
    who excelled in and advanced numerous fields. One of the earliest such polymaths
    was al-Farabi (also known as Alpharabius, died ca. 950), a Baghdadi thinker who,
    in addition to his prolific writing on many aspects of Platonic and Aristotelian
    philosophy, also wrote on physics, psychology, alchemy, cosmology, music, and
    much else. So esteemed was he that he came to be known as the “Second Teacher”
    — second greatest, that is, after Aristotle. Another great polymath was al-Biruni
    (died 1048), who wrote 146 treatises totaling 13,000 pages in virtually every
    scientific field. His major work, ***[The Description of India](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393005682?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0393005682)***,
    was an anthropological work on Hindus. One of al-Biruni’s most notable accomplishments
    was the near-accurate measurement of the Earth’s circumference using his own trigonometric
    method; he missed the correct measurement of 24,900 miles by only 200 miles. (However,
    unlike Rhazes, Avicenna, and al-Farabi, al-Biruni’s works were never translated
    into Latin and thus did not have much influence beyond the Arabic world.) Another
    of the most brilliant minds of the Golden Age was the physicist and geometrician
    Alhazen (also known as Ibn al-Haytham; died 1040). Although his greatest legacy
    is in optics — he showed the flaws in the theory of extramission, which held that
    our eyes emit energy that makes it possible for us to see — he also did work in
    astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. And perhaps the most renowned scholar
    of the late Golden Age was Averroës (also known as Ibn Rushd; died 1198), a philosopher,
    theologian, physician, and jurist best known for his commentaries on Aristotle.
    The 20,000 pages he wrote over his lifetime included works in philosophy, medicine,
    biology, physics, and astronomy.

    — 他揭示了脱射理论的缺陷，即我们的眼睛发出能量使我们能够看见的理论 — 他还在天文学、数学和工程学方面做了工作。也许黄金时代后期最著名的学者是**伊本·鲁什德**（1198年去世，也称为阿维鲁斯），他是一位哲学家、神学家、医师和法学家，以其对亚里士多德的评论而闻名。他一生写下的2万页作品包括哲学、医学、生物学、物理学和天文学等领域的作品。

    or drama, which they regarded as useless or inferior. Indeed, science under Islam,

    purposes of rhetoric and what we would today call ideological warfare: Aristotle’s

- en: The second factor central to the rise of the translation movement was that Greek
    thought had already been diffused in the region, slowly and over a long period,
    before the Abbasids and indeed before the advent of Islam. Partly for this reason,
    the Abbasid Baghdad translation movement was not like the West’s subsequent rediscovery
    of ancient Athens, in that it was in some respects a continuation of Middle Eastern
    Hellenism. Greek thought spread as early as Alexander the Great’s conquests of
    Asia and North Africa in the 300s b.c., and Greek centers, such as in Alexandria
    and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (238-140 b.c., in what is now Afghanistan), were
    productive centers of learning even amid Roman conquest. By the time of the Arab
    conquests, the Greek tongue was known throughout the vast region, and it was the
    administrative language of Syria and Egypt. After the arrival of Christianity,
    Greek thought was spread further by missionary activity, especially by Nestorian
    Christians. Centuries later, well into the rule of the Abbasids in Baghdad, many
    of these Nestorians — some of them Arabs and Arabized Persians who eventually
    converted to Islam — contributed technical skill for the Greek-Arabic translation

  zh: 翻译运动兴起的第二个核心因素是希腊思想在阿巴斯王朝和伊斯兰教诞生之前的长时期内已经在该地区慢慢扩散。部分原因是，希腊思想早在公元前300年亚历山大大帝征服亚洲和北非时就已传播开来，并且希腊中心，如亚历山大和希腊-大夏王国（公元前238-140年，今阿富汗），即使在罗马征服中也是学习的中心。到了阿拉伯征服时期，希腊语已在整个广阔地区通行，并成为叙利亚和埃及的行政语言。基督教的到来后，希腊思想通过传教活动进一步传播，特别是通过涅斯托利派基督徒。几个世纪后，在阿巴斯王朝统治巴格达期间，许多这些涅斯托利派人士
    — 其中包括一些最终皈依伊斯兰教的阿拉伯人和阿拉伯化的波斯人 — 为希腊-阿拉伯翻译运动做出了技术上的贡献，甚至在阿巴斯王朝政府中担任许多与翻译有关的行政职务。
- en: While practical utility and the influence of Hellenism help explain why science
    *could* develop, both were true of most of the Arabic world during the Golden
    Age and so cannot account for the Abbasid translation movement in particular.
    As Gutas argues, the distinguishing factor that led to that movement was the attempt
    by the Abbasid rulers to legitimize their rule by co-opting Persian culture, which
    at the time deeply revered Greek thought. The Baghdad region in which the Abbasids
    established themselves included a major Persian population, which played an instrumental
    role in the revolution that ended the previous dynasty; thus, the Abbasids made
    many symbolic and political gestures to ingratiate themselves with the Persians.
    In an effort to enfold this constituency into a reliable ruling base, the Abbasids
    incorporated Zoroastrianism and the imperial ideology of the defunct Persian Sasanian
    Empire, more than a century gone, into their political platform. The Abbasid rulers
    sought to establish the idea that they were the successors not to the defeated
    Arab Umayyads who had been overthrown in 750 but to the region’s previous imperial
    dynasty, the Sasanians.

- en: This incorporation of Sasanian ideology led to the translation of Greek texts
    into Arabic because doing so was seen as recovering not just Greek, but Persian
    knowledge. The Persians believed that sacred ancient Zoroastrian texts were scattered

- en: Initially, Arab Muslims themselves did not seem to care much about the translation
    movement and the study of science, feeling that they had “no ethnic or historical
    stake in it,” as Gutas explains. This began to change during the reign of al-Mamun
    (died 833), the seventh Abbasid caliph. For the purposes of opposing the Byzantine
    Empire, al-Mamun reoriented the translation movement as a means to recovering
    Greek, rather than Persian, learning. In the eyes of Abbasid Muslims of this era,
    the ancient Greeks did not have a pristine reputation — they were not Muslims,
    after all — but at least they were not tainted with Christianity. The fact that
    the hated Christian Byzantines did not embrace the ancient Greeks, though, led
    the Abbasids to warm to them. This philhellenism in the centuries after al-Mamun
    marked a prideful distinction between the Arabs — who considered themselves “champions
    of the truth,” as Gutas puts it — and their benighted Christian contemporaries.
    One Arab philosopher, al-Kindi (died 870), even devised a genealogy that presented

    — 毕竟，他们不是穆斯林 — 但至少他们没有被基督教污染。然而，憎恨的基督教拜占庭人没有接纳古希腊学问，这使得阿巴斯王朝对其产生了兴趣。阿尔马穆恩之后几个世纪的这种希腊热情主义标志着阿拉伯人自认为是“真理的捍卫者”，正如Gutas所说的那样
    — 与他们愚昧的基督教时代的同代人形成了自豪的差别。一位阿拉伯哲学家阿尔·坎迪（逝世于870年）甚至设计了一个族谱，将古希腊人的祖先尤南（Yunan）描绘为阿拉伯人祖先卡赫坦（Qahtan）的兄弟。
- en: Until its collapse in the Mongol invasion of 1258, the Abbasid caliphate was
    the greatest power in the Islamic world and oversaw the most intellectually productive
    movement in Arab history. The Abbasids read, commented on, translated, and preserved
    Greek and Persian works that may have been otherwise lost. By making Greek thought
    accessible, they also formed the foundation of the Arabic Golden Age. Major works
    of philosophy and science far from Baghdad — in Spain, Egypt, and Central Asia
    — were influenced by Greek-Arabic translations, both during and after the Abbasids.
    Indeed, even if it is a matter of conjecture to what extent the rise of science

    teachers; those who had been masters became pupils, often reluctant and resentful
    pupils.” The civilization that had produced cities, libraries, and observatories

    is no simple explanation for its gradual — not sudden, as al-Afghani claims —
    demise. The most significant factor was physical and geopolitical. As early as
    the tenth or eleventh century, the Abbasid empire began to factionalize and fragment
    due to increased provincial autonomy and frequent uprisings. By 1258, the little
    that was left of the Abbasid state was swept away by the Mongol invasion. And
    in Spain, Christians reconquered Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248\. But the
    Islamic turn away from scholarship actually preceded the civilization’s geopolitical
    decline — it can be traced back to the rise of the anti-philosophical Ash’arism
    school among Sunni Muslims, who comprise the vast majority of the Muslim world.

    —— 这可以追溯到逊尼派穆斯林中反哲学的阿什阿里派学派的兴起。

    to the time of the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun. Al-Mamun picked up the pro-science
    torch lit by the second caliph, al-Mansur, and ran with it. He responded to a
    crisis of legitimacy by attempting to undermine traditionalist religious scholarswhile
    actively sponsoring a doctrine called Mu’tazilism that was deeply influenced by
    Greek rationalism, particularly Aristotelianism. To this end, he imposed an inquisition,
    under which those who refused to profess their allegiance to Mu’tazilism were
    punished by flogging, imprisonment, or beheading. But the caliphs who followed
    al-Mamun upheld the doctrine with less fervor, and within a few decades, adherence
    to it became a punishable offense. The backlash against Mu’tazilism was tremendously
    successful: by 885, a half century after al-Mamun’s death, it even became a crime
    to copy books of philosophy. The beginning of the de-Hellenization of Arabic high

    is linked to the decline of Arabic science. With the rise of the Ash’arites, the
    ethos in the Islamic world was increasingly opposed to original scholarship and
    any scientific inquiry that did not directly aid in religious regulation of private
    and public life. While the Mu’tazilites had contended that the Koran was *created*
    and so God’s purpose for man must be interpreted through reason, the Ash’arites
    believed the Koran to be coeval with God — and therefore unchallengeable. At the
    heart of Ash’ari metaphysics is the idea of occasionalism, a doctrine that denies
    natural causality. Put simply, it suggests natural necessity cannot exist because
    God’s will is completely free. Ash’arites believed that God is the only cause,

    this view sees natural things that appear to be permanent as merely following
    habit. Heat follows fire and hunger follows lack of food as a matter of habit,
    not necessity, “just as the king generally rides on horseback through the streets
    of the city, and is never found departing from this habit; but reason does not
    find it impossible that he should walk on foot through the place.” According to
    the occasionalist view, tomorrow coldness might follow fire, and satiety might
    follow lack of food. God wills every single atomic event and God’s will is not
    bound up with reason. This amounts to a denial of the coherence and comprehensibility
    of the natural world. In his controversial 2006 [University of Regensburg address](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html),

    theologian Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (also known as Algazel; died 1111). In his book
    ***[The Incoherence of the Philosophers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842524665?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0842524665)***,
    al-Ghazali vigorously attacked philosophy and philosophers — both the Greek philosophers
    themselves and their followers in the Muslim world (such as al-Farabi and Avicenna).
    Al-Ghazali was worried that when people become favorably influenced by philosophical
    arguments, they will also come to trust the philosophers on matters of religion,
    thus making Muslims less pious. Reason, because it teaches us to discover, question,
    and innovate, was the enemy; al-Ghazali argued that in assuming necessity in nature,
    philosophy was incompatible with Islamic teaching, which recognizes that nature
    is entirely subject to God’s will: “Nothing in nature,” he wrote, “can act spontaneously
    and apart from God.” While al-Ghazali did defend logic, he did so only to the
    extent that it could be used to ask theological questions and wielded as a tool
    to undermine philosophy. Sunnis embraced al-Ghazali as the winner of the debate
    with the Hellenistic rationalists, and opposition to philosophy gradually ossified,
    even to the extent that independent inquiry became a tainted enterprise, sometimes
    to the point of criminality. It is an exaggeration to say, as Steven Weinberg
    [claimed in the *Times* of London](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/religion/article2305888.ece),
    that after al-Ghazali “there was no more science worth mentioning in Islamic countries”;
    in some places, especially Central Asia, Arabic work in science continued for
    some time, and philosophy was still studied somewhat under Shi’ite rule. (In the

    the lack of a scientific curriculum in medieval madrassas reflects a deeper absence
    of a capacity or willingness to build legally autonomous institutions. Madrassas
    were established under the law of *waqf*, or pious endowments, which meant they
    were legally obligated to follow the religious commitments of their founders.
    Islamic law did not recognize any corporate groups or entities, and so prevented
    any hope of recognizing institutions such as universities within which scholarly
    norms could develop. (Medieval China, too, had no independent institutions dedicated
    to learning; all were dependent on the official bureaucracy and the state.) Legally
    autonomous institutions were utterly absent in the Islamic world until the late
    nineteenth century. And madrassas nearly always excluded study of anything besides
    the subjects that aid in understanding Islam: Arabic grammar, the Koran, the hadith,
    and the principles of sharia. These were often referred to as the “Islamic sciences,”
    in contrast to Greek sciences, which were widely referred to as the “foreign”
    or “alien” sciences (indeed, the term “philosopher” in Arabic — *faylasu**f* —
    was often used pejoratively). Furthermore, the rigidity of the religious curriculum
    in madrassas contributed to the educational method of learning by rote; even today,

- en: The exclusion of science and mathematics from the madrassas suggests that these
    subjects “were institutionally marginal in medieval Islamic life,” writes Huff.
    Such inquiry was tolerated, and sometimes promoted by individuals, but it was
    never “officially institutionalized and sanctioned by the intellectual elite of
    Islam.” This meant that when intellectual discoveries were made, they were not
    picked up and carried by students, and did not influence later thinkers in Muslim
    communities. No one paid much attention to the work of Averroës after he was driven
    out of Spain to Morocco, for instance — that is, until Europeans rediscovered
    his work. Perhaps the lack of institutional support for science allowed Arabic
    thinkers (such as al-Farabi) to be bolder than their European counterparts. But
    it also meant that many Arabic thinkers relied on the patronage of friendly rulers
    and ephemeral conditions.

    Europe — which saw the absorption of Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Christian
    theology — was instrumental in forming a philosophically and theologically open
    culture that respected scientific development. As Huff argues, because European
    universities were legally autonomous, they could develop their own rules, scholarly
    norms, and curricula. The norms they incorporated were those of curiosity and
    skepticism, and the curricula they chose were steeped in ancient Greek philosophy.
    In the medieval Western world, a spirit of skepticism and inquisitiveness moved
    theologians and philosophers. It was a spirit of “probing and poking around,”
    as Edward Grant writes in ***[God and Reason in the Middle Ages](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521802792?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0521802792)***

    Beginning in the early Middle Ages, this attitude was evident in technological
    innovations among even unlearned artisans and merchants. These obscure people
    contributed to the development of practical technologies, such as the mechanical
    clock (circa 1272) and spectacles (circa 1284). Even as early as the sixth century,
    Europeans strove to invent labor-saving technology, such as the heavy-wheeled
    plow and, later, the padded horse collar. According to [research by the late Charles
    Issawi](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/52639/bernard-lewis/the-west-and-the-middle-east)
    of Princeton University, eleventh-century England had more mills per capita than
    even the Ottoman lands at the height of the empire’s power. And although it was
    in use since 1460 in the West, the printing press was not introduced in the Islamic
    world until 1727\. The Arabic world appears to have been even slower in finding
    uses for academic technological devices. For instance, the telescope appeared
    in the Middle East soon after its invention in 1608, but it failed to attract
    excitement or interest until centuries later.

    and translated classical and scientific works, mainly through cultural centers
    in Spain. By 1200, Oxford and Paris had curricula that included works of Arabic
    science. Works by Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy, and Galen, along with commentaries
    by Avicenna and Averroës, were all translated into Latin. Not only were these
    works taught openly, but they were formally incorporated into the program of study
    of universities. Meanwhile, in the Islamic world, the dissolution of the Golden
    Age was well underway.

    to point to the obvious factors: authoritarianism, bad education, and underfunding
    (Muslim states spend significantly less than developed states on research and
    development as a percentage of GDP). But these reasons are all broad and somewhat
    crude, and raise more questions than answers. At a deeper level, Islam lags because
    it failed to offer a way to institutionalize free inquiry. That, in turn, is attributable
    to its failure to reconcile faith and reason. In this respect, Islamic societies
    have fared worse not just than the West but also than many societies of Asia.
    With a couple of exceptions, every country in the Middle Eastern parts of the
    Muslim world has been ruled by an autocrat, a radical Islamic sect, or a tribal
    chieftain. Islam has no tradition of separating politics and religion.'

    and remains deeply humiliating for Muslims. Since Islam tended to ascribe its
    political power to its theological superiority over other faiths, its fading as
    a worldly power raised profound questions about where a wrong turn was made. Over
    at least the past century, Muslim reformers have been debating how best to reacquire
    the lost honor. In the same period, the Muslim world tried, and failed, to reverse
    its decline by borrowing Western technology and sociopolitical ideas, including
    secularization and nationalism. But these tastes of “modernization” turned many
    Muslims away from modernity. This raises a question: Can and should Islam’s past
    achievements serve as a standard for Islam’s future? After all, it is quite common
    to imply, as President Obama did, that knowledge of the Golden Age of Arabic science
    will somehow exhort the Islamic world to improve itself and to hate the West less.'

    and modernity; perhaps, too, it holds out the prospect of Islam coming to benefit
    from principles it badly needs in order to prosper, such as sexual equality, the
    rule of law, and free civil life. But the predominant posture among many Muslims
    today is that the good life is best approximated by returning to a pristine and
    pious past — and this posture has proven poisonous to coping with modernity. Islamism,
    the cause of violence that the world is now agonizingly familiar with, arises
    from doctrines characterized by a deep nostalgia for the Islamic classical period.
    Even today, suggesting that the Koran isn’t coeternal with God can make one an
    infidel.

    many Arabic societies. So to the extent that appeals to the salutary classical
    attitude can be found in the Islamic tradition, the fanatical false nostalgia
    might be tamed. Some reformers already point out that many medieval Muslims embraced
    reason and other ideas that presaged modernity, and that doing so is not impious
    and does not mean simply giving up eternal rewards for materialistic ones. On
    an intellectual level, this effort could be deepened by challenging the Ash’ari
    orthodoxy that has dominated Sunni Islam for a thousand years — that is, by asking
    whether al-Ghazali and his Ash’arite followers really understood nature, theology,
    and philosophy better than the Mu’tazilites.

    misguided. One is that medieval Islam does not offer a decent political standard.
    When compared to modern Western standards, the Golden Age of Arabic science was
    decidedly not a Golden Age of equality. While Islam was comparatively tolerant
    at the time of members of other religions, the kind of tolerance we think of today
    was never a virtue for early Muslims (or early Christians, for that matter). As
    Bernard Lewis puts it in ***[The Jews of Islam](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415611806?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0415611806)***
    (1984), giving equal treatment to followers and rejecters of the true faith would
    have been seen not only as an absurdity but also an outright “dereliction of duty.”
    Jews and Christians were subjected to official second-class sociopolitical status
    beginning in Mohammed’s time, and Abbasid-era oppressions also included religious
    persecution and the eradication of churches and synagogues. The Golden Age was
    also an era of widespread slavery of persons deemed to be of even lower class.
    For all the estimable achievements of the medieval Arabic world, it is quite clear
    that its political and social history should not be made into a celebrated standard.

    the most rationalist schools in Islam did not categorically argue for the primacy
    of reason. As Ali A. Allawi argues in ***[The Crisis of Islamic Civilization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300164068?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0300164068)***
    (2009), “None of the free-thinking schools in classical Islam — such as the Mu’tazila
    — could ever entertain the idea of breaking the God-Man relationship and the validity
    of revelation, in spite of their espousal of a rationalist philosophy.” Indeed,
    in 1889 the Hungarian scholar Ignaz Goldziher noted in his essay “[The Attitude
    of Orthodox Islam Toward the ‘Ancient Sciences’](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0202307786?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0202307786)”
    that it was not only Ash’arite but Mu’tazilite circles that “produced numerous
    polemical treatises against Aristotelian philosophy in general and against logic
    in particular.” Even before al-Ghazali’s attack on the Mu’tazilites, engaging
    in Greek philosophy was not exactly a safe task outside of auspicious but rather
    ephemeral conditions.'

    not go very far in persuading Muslims to reflect on the theological-political
    problem of Islam. For all the great help that the rediscovery of the influential
    Arabic philosophers (especially al-Farabi, Averroës, and Maimonides) would provide,
    no science-friendly Islamic tradition goes nearly far enough, to the point that
    it offers a theological renovation in the vein of Luther and Calvin — a reinterpretation
    of Islam that challenges the faith’s comprehensive ruling principles in a way
    that simultaneously convinces Muslims that they are in fact returning to the fundamentals
    of their faith.

    own past: while there are many things that the Islamic world lacks, pride in heritage
    is not one of them. What is needed in Islam is less self-pride and more self-criticism.
    Today, self-criticism in Islam is valued only insofar as it is made as an appeal
    to be more pious and less spiritually corrupt. And yet most criticism in the Muslim
    world is directed outward, at the West. This prejudice — what Fouad Ajami has
    called (referring to the Arab world) “a political tradition of belligerent self-pity”
    — is undoubtedly one of Islam’s biggest obstacles. It makes information that contradicts
    orthodox belief irrelevant, and it closes off debate about the nature and history
    of Islam.'

    and research of manuscripts of the era, may have a beneficial effect — so long
    as it is pursued in an analytical spirit. That would mean that Muslims would use
    it as a resource within their own tradition to *critically* engage with their
    philosophical, political, and founding flaws. If that occurs, it will not arise
    from any Western outreach efforts, but will be a consequence of Muslims’ own determination,
    creativity, and wisdom — in short, those very traits that Westerners rightly ascribe
    to the Muslims of the Golden Age.
