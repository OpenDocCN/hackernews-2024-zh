    the thirteenth century, it is tempting to ask what went wrong — why it is that
    modern science did not arise from Baghdad or Cairo or Córdoba. We will turn to
    this question later, but it is important to keep in mind that the decline of scientific
    activity is the rule, not the exception, of civilizations. While it is commonplace
    to assume that the scientific revolution and the progress of technology were inevitable,
    in fact the West is the single sustained success story out of many civilizations

- en: A preliminary caution must be noted about both parts of the term “Arabic science.”
    This is, first, because the scientists discussed here were not all Arab Muslims.
    Indeed, most of the greatest thinkers of the era were not ethnically Arab. This
    is not surprising considering that, for several centuries throughout the Middle
    East, Muslims were a minority (a trend that only began to change at the end of
    the tenth century). The second caution about “Arabic science” is that it was not
    science as we are familiar with it today. Pre-modern science, while not blind
    to utility, sought knowledge primarily in order to understand philosophical questions
    concerned with meaning, being, the good, and so on. Modern science, by contrast,
    grew out of a revolution in thought that reoriented politics around individual
    comfort through the mastery of nature. Modern science dismisses ancient metaphysical
    questions as (to borrow Francis Bacon’s words) the pursuit of pleasure and vanity.
    Whatever modern science owes to Arabic science, the intellectual activity of the
    medieval Islamic world was not of the same kind as the European scientific revolution,
    which came after a radical break from ancient natural philosophy. Indeed, even
    though we use the term “science” for convenience, it is important to remember
    that this word was not coined until the nineteenth century; the closest word in
    Arabic — *ilm* — means “knowledge,” and not necessarily that of the natural world.

    of the Golden Age as Arabic. The first is that most of the philosophical and scientific
    work at the time was eventually translated into Arabic, which became the language
    of most scholars in the region, regardless of ethnicity or religious background.
    And second, the alternatives — “Middle Eastern science” or “Islamic science” —
    are even less accurate. This is in part because very little is known about the
    personal backgrounds of these thinkers. But it is also because of another caution
    we must keep in mind about this subject, which ought to be footnoted to every
    broad assertion made about the Golden Age: surprisingly little is known for certain
    even about the social and historical context of this era. Abdelhamid I. Sabra,
    a now-retired professor of the history of Arabic science who taught at Harvard,
    [described his field to the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html)
    in 2001 as one that “hasn’t even begun yet.”'

    Arabic civilization contributed much more to the development of science than the
    passive transmission to the West of ancient thought and of inventions originating
    elsewhere (such as the numeral system from India and papermaking from China).
    For one thing, the scholarly revival in Abbasid Baghdad (751-1258) that resulted
    in the translation of almost all the scientific works of the classical Greeks
    into Arabic is nothing to scoff at. But beyond their translations of (and commentaries
    upon) the ancients, Arabic thinkers made original contributions, both through
    writing and methodical experimentation, in such fields as philosophy, astronomy,
    medicine, chemistry, geography, physics, optics, and mathematics.

    algebra. The book starts out with a mathematical introduction, and proceeds to
    explain how to solve then-commonplace issues involving trade, inheritance, marriage,
    and slave emancipations. (Its methods involve no equations or algebraic symbols,

    in the history of Arabic science, and considered among the greatest of all medieval

    (died 925) was trained in Baghdad and became the director of two hospitals. He
    identified smallpox and measles, writing a treatise on them that became influential
    beyond the Middle East and into nineteenth-century Europe. Rhazes was the first
    to discover that fever is a defense mechanism. And he was the author of an encyclopedia
    of medicine that spanned twenty-three volumes. What is most striking about his
    career, as Ehsan Masood points out in ***[Science and Islam](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1848310811?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1848310811)***,
    is that Rhazes was the first to seriously challenge the seeming infallibility
    of the classical physician Galen. For example, he disputed Galen’s theory of humors,
    and he conducted a controlled experiment to see if bloodletting, which was the
    most common medical procedure up until the nineteenth century, actually worked
    as a medical treatment. (He found that it did.) Rhazes provides a clear instance
    of a thinker explicitly questioning, and empirically testing, the widely-accepted
    theories of an ancient giant, while making original contributions to a field.

    who excelled in and advanced numerous fields. One of the earliest such polymaths

    in addition to his prolific writing on many aspects of Platonic and Aristotelian
    philosophy, also wrote on physics, psychology, alchemy, cosmology, music, and
    much else. So esteemed was he that he came to be known as the “Second Teacher”
    — second greatest, that is, after Aristotle. Another great polymath was al-Biruni
    (died 1048), who wrote 146 treatises totaling 13,000 pages in virtually every
    scientific field. His major work, ***[The Description of India](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393005682?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0393005682)***,
    was an anthropological work on Hindus. One of al-Biruni’s most notable accomplishments
    was the near-accurate measurement of the Earth’s circumference using his own trigonometric
    method; he missed the correct measurement of 24,900 miles by only 200 miles. (However,
    unlike Rhazes, Avicenna, and al-Farabi, al-Biruni’s works were never translated
    into Latin and thus did not have much influence beyond the Arabic world.) Another
    of the most brilliant minds of the Golden Age was the physicist and geometrician
    Alhazen (also known as Ibn al-Haytham; died 1040). Although his greatest legacy
    is in optics — he showed the flaws in the theory of extramission, which held that
    our eyes emit energy that makes it possible for us to see — he also did work in
    astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. And perhaps the most renowned scholar
    of the late Golden Age was Averroës (also known as Ibn Rushd; died 1198), a philosopher,
    theologian, physician, and jurist best known for his commentaries on Aristotle.
    The 20,000 pages he wrote over his lifetime included works in philosophy, medicine,
    biology, physics, and astronomy.

    Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, and much of North Africa, Central Asia, Spain, and

    under the Abbasid caliphs (ruling in Baghdad from 751 to 1258), which saw the
    most intellectually productive age in Arab history.The rise of the first centralized
    Islamic state under the Abbasids profoundly shaped life in the Islamic world,
    transforming it from a tribal culture with little literacy to a dynamic empire.
    To be sure, the vast empire was theologically and ethnically diverse; but the
    removal of political barriers that previously divided the region meant that scholars
    from different religious and ethnic backgrounds could travel and interact with

    of the West. Several large metropolises — including Baghdad, Basra, Wasit, and

    and assimilation of the Greek heritage — a development fueled by the translation
    movement in Abbasid Baghdad. The translation movement, according to Yale historian
    and classicist Dimitri Gutas, is “equal in significance to, and belongs to the
    same narrative as … that of Pericles’ Athens, the Italian Renaissance, or the
    scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.” Whether or
    not one is willing to grant Gutas the comparison, there is no question that the
    translation movement in Baghdad — which by the year 1000 saw nearly the entire
    Greek corpus in medicine, mathematics, and natural philosophy translated into
    Arabic — provided the foundation for inquiry in the sciences. While most of the
    great thinkers in the Golden Age were not themselves in Baghdad, the Arabic world’s
    other cultural centers likely would not have thrived without Baghdad’s translation
    movement. For this reason, even if it is said that the Golden Age of Arabic science

    First, the Abbasids found scientific Greek texts immensely useful for a sort of
    technological progress — solving common problems to make daily life easier. The
    Abbasids did not bother translating works in subjects such as poetry, history,
    or drama, which they regarded as useless or inferior. Indeed, science under Islam,
    although in part an extension of Greek science, was much less theoretical than
    that of the ancients. Translated works in mathematics, for example, were eventually
    used for engineering and irrigation, as well as in calculation for intricate inheritance
    laws. And translating Greek works on medicine had obvious practical use.

    turned to it for proof that the caliphate was the divinely ordained successor

    with Islamic teaching that only God has such knowledge.'

    For example, the Arabic astronomer Ibn al-Shatir (died 1375) also served as a
    religious official, a timekeeper (*muwaqqit*), for the Great Mosque of Damascus.
    Another religious motivation for translating Greek works was their value for the
    purposes of rhetoric and what we would today call ideological warfare: Aristotle’s
    *Topics*, a treatise on logic, was used to aid in religious disputation with non-Muslims
    and in the conversion of nonbelievers to Islam (which was state policy under the

    thought had already been diffused in the region, slowly and over a long period,
    before the Abbasids and indeed before the advent of Islam. Partly for this reason,
    the Abbasid Baghdad translation movement was not like the West’s subsequent rediscovery
    of ancient Athens, in that it was in some respects a continuation of Middle Eastern
    Hellenism. Greek thought spread as early as Alexander the Great’s conquests of
    Asia and North Africa in the 300s b.c., and Greek centers, such as in Alexandria
    and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (238-140 b.c., in what is now Afghanistan), were
    productive centers of learning even amid Roman conquest. By the time of the Arab
    conquests, the Greek tongue was known throughout the vast region, and it was the
    administrative language of Syria and Egypt. After the arrival of Christianity,
    Greek thought was spread further by missionary activity, especially by Nestorian
    Christians. Centuries later, well into the rule of the Abbasids in Baghdad, many
    of these Nestorians — some of them Arabs and Arabized Persians who eventually
    converted to Islam — contributed technical skill for the Greek-Arabic translation
    movement, and even filled many translation-oriented administrative posts in the

    As Gutas argues, the distinguishing factor that led to that movement was the attempt
    by the Abbasid rulers to legitimize their rule by co-opting Persian culture, which
    at the time deeply revered Greek thought. The Baghdad region in which the Abbasids
    established themselves included a major Persian population, which played an instrumental
    role in the revolution that ended the previous dynasty; thus, the Abbasids made
    many symbolic and political gestures to ingratiate themselves with the Persians.
    In an effort to enfold this constituency into a reliable ruling base, the Abbasids
    incorporated Zoroastrianism and the imperial ideology of the defunct Persian Sasanian
    Empire, more than a century gone, into their political platform. The Abbasid rulers
    sought to establish the idea that they were the successors not to the defeated
    Arab Umayyads who had been overthrown in 750 but to the region’s previous imperial
    dynasty, the Sasanians.

    into Arabic because doing so was seen as recovering not just Greek, but Persian
    knowledge. The Persians believed that sacred ancient Zoroastrian texts were scattered
    by Alexander the Great’s destruction of Persepolis in 330 b.c., and were subsequently
    appropriated by the Greeks. By translating ancient Greek texts into Arabic, Persian
    wisdom could be recovered.

    movement and the study of science, feeling that they had “no ethnic or historical
    stake in it,” as Gutas explains. This began to change during the reign of al-Mamun
    (died 833), the seventh Abbasid caliph. For the purposes of opposing the Byzantine
    Empire, al-Mamun reoriented the translation movement as a means to recovering
    Greek, rather than Persian, learning. In the eyes of Abbasid Muslims of this era,
    the ancient Greeks did not have a pristine reputation — they were not Muslims,
    after all — but at least they were not tainted with Christianity. The fact that
    the hated Christian Byzantines did not embrace the ancient Greeks, though, led
    the Abbasids to warm to them. This philhellenism in the centuries after al-Mamun
    marked a prideful distinction between the Arabs — who considered themselves “champions
    of the truth,” as Gutas puts it — and their benighted Christian contemporaries.
    One Arab philosopher, al-Kindi (died 870), even devised a genealogy that presented
    Yunan, the ancestor of the ancient Greeks, as the brother of Qahtan, the ancestor
    of the Arabs.

    the greatest power in the Islamic world and oversaw the most intellectually productive
    movement in Arab history. The Abbasids read, commented on, translated, and preserved
    Greek and Persian works that may have been otherwise lost. By making Greek thought
    accessible, they also formed the foundation of the Arabic Golden Age. Major works
    of philosophy and science far from Baghdad — in Spain, Egypt, and Central Asia
    — were influenced by Greek-Arabic translations, both during and after the Abbasids.
    Indeed, even if it is a matter of conjecture to what extent the rise of science

    “It is permissible … to ask oneself why Arab civilization, after having thrown

    darkness.”

    is no simple explanation for its gradual — not sudden, as al-Afghani claims —
    demise. The most significant factor was physical and geopolitical. As early as
    the tenth or eleventh century, the Abbasid empire began to factionalize and fragment
    due to increased provincial autonomy and frequent uprisings. By 1258, the little
    that was left of the Abbasid state was swept away by the Mongol invasion. And
    in Spain, Christians reconquered Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248\. But the
    Islamic turn away from scholarship actually preceded the civilization’s geopolitical
    decline — it can be traced back to the rise of the anti-philosophical Ash’arism
    school among Sunni Muslims, who comprise the vast majority of the Muslim world.

    crisis of legitimacy by attempting to undermine traditionalist religious scholarswhile
    actively sponsoring a doctrine called Mu’tazilism that was deeply influenced by
    Greek rationalism, particularly Aristotelianism. To this end, he imposed an inquisition,
    under which those who refused to profess their allegiance to Mu’tazilism were
    punished by flogging, imprisonment, or beheading. But the caliphs who followed
    al-Mamun upheld the doctrine with less fervor, and within a few decades, adherence
    to it became a punishable offense. The backlash against Mu’tazilism was tremendously
    successful: by 885, a half century after al-Mamun’s death, it even became a crime
    to copy books of philosophy. The beginning of the de-Hellenization of Arabic high

    any scientific inquiry that did not directly aid in religious regulation of private

    and so God’s purpose for man must be interpreted through reason, the Ash’arites
    believed the Koran to be coeval with God — and therefore unchallengeable. At the
    heart of Ash’ari metaphysics is the idea of occasionalism, a doctrine that denies
    natural causality. Put simply, it suggests natural necessity cannot exist because
    God’s will is completely free. Ash’arites believed that God is the only cause,

    find it impossible that he should walk on foot through the place.” According to
    the occasionalist view, tomorrow coldness might follow fire, and satiety might
    follow lack of food. God wills every single atomic event and God’s will is not
    bound up with reason. This amounts to a denial of the coherence and comprehensibility
    of the natural world. In his controversial 2006 [University of Regensburg address](http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html),

    were established under the law of *waqf*, or pious endowments, which meant they
    were legally obligated to follow the religious commitments of their founders.
    Islamic law did not recognize any corporate groups or entities, and so prevented
    any hope of recognizing institutions such as universities within which scholarly
    norms could develop. (Medieval China, too, had no independent institutions dedicated
    to learning; all were dependent on the official bureaucracy and the state.) Legally
    autonomous institutions were utterly absent in the Islamic world until the late
    nineteenth century. And madrassas nearly always excluded study of anything besides
    the subjects that aid in understanding Islam: Arabic grammar, the Koran, the hadith,
    and the principles of sharia. These were often referred to as the “Islamic sciences,”
    in contrast to Greek sciences, which were widely referred to as the “foreign”
    or “alien” sciences (indeed, the term “philosopher” in Arabic — *faylasu**f* —
    was often used pejoratively). Furthermore, the rigidity of the religious curriculum
    in madrassas contributed to the educational method of learning by rote; even today,

    Islam.” This meant that when intellectual discoveries were made, they were not
    picked up and carried by students, and did not influence later thinkers in Muslim
    communities. No one paid much attention to the work of Averroës after he was driven
    out of Spain to Morocco, for instance — that is, until Europeans rediscovered
    his work. Perhaps the lack of institutional support for science allowed Arabic

    at least the past century, Muslim reformers have been debating how best to reacquire
    the lost honor. In the same period, the Muslim world tried, and failed, to reverse
    its decline by borrowing Western technology and sociopolitical ideas, including
    secularization and nationalism. But these tastes of “modernization” turned many
    Muslims away from modernity. This raises a question: Can and should Islam’s past
    achievements serve as a standard for Islam’s future? After all, it is quite common
    to imply, as President Obama did, that knowledge of the Golden Age of Arabic science
    will somehow exhort the Islamic world to improve itself and to hate the West less.'

    and modernity; perhaps, too, it holds out the prospect of Islam coming to benefit
    from principles it badly needs in order to prosper, such as sexual equality, the
    rule of law, and free civil life. But the predominant posture among many Muslims
    today is that the good life is best approximated by returning to a pristine and
    pious past — and this posture has proven poisonous to coping with modernity. Islamism,
    the cause of violence that the world is now agonizingly familiar with, arises
    from doctrines characterized by a deep nostalgia for the Islamic classical period.
    Even today, suggesting that the Koran isn’t coeternal with God can make one an
    infidel.

    many Arabic societies. So to the extent that appeals to the salutary classical
    attitude can be found in the Islamic tradition, the fanatical false nostalgia
    might be tamed. Some reformers already point out that many medieval Muslims embraced
    reason and other ideas that presaged modernity, and that doing so is not impious
    and does not mean simply giving up eternal rewards for materialistic ones. On
    an intellectual level, this effort could be deepened by challenging the Ash’ari
    orthodoxy that has dominated Sunni Islam for a thousand years — that is, by asking
    whether al-Ghazali and his Ash’arite followers really understood nature, theology,
    and philosophy better than the Mu’tazilites.

    misguided. One is that medieval Islam does not offer a decent political standard.
    When compared to modern Western standards, the Golden Age of Arabic science was
    decidedly not a Golden Age of equality. While Islam was comparatively tolerant
    at the time of members of other religions, the kind of tolerance we think of today
    was never a virtue for early Muslims (or early Christians, for that matter). As
    Bernard Lewis puts it in ***[The Jews of Islam](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415611806?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0415611806)***
    (1984), giving equal treatment to followers and rejecters of the true faith would
    have been seen not only as an absurdity but also an outright “dereliction of duty.”
    Jews and Christians were subjected to official second-class sociopolitical status
    beginning in Mohammed’s time, and Abbasid-era oppressions also included religious
    persecution and the eradication of churches and synagogues. The Golden Age was
    also an era of widespread slavery of persons deemed to be of even lower class.
    For all the estimable achievements of the medieval Arabic world, it is quite clear
    that its political and social history should not be made into a celebrated standard.

    to urge the Muslim world to restore those parts of its past that valued rational
    and open inquiry: namely, a return to the Mu’tazilites may not be enough. Even
    the most rationalist schools in Islam did not categorically argue for the primacy
    of reason. As Ali A. Allawi argues in ***[The Crisis of Islamic Civilization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300164068?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0300164068)***
    (2009), “None of the free-thinking schools in classical Islam — such as the Mu’tazila
    — could ever entertain the idea of breaking the God-Man relationship and the validity
    of revelation, in spite of their espousal of a rationalist philosophy.” Indeed,
    in 1889 the Hungarian scholar Ignaz Goldziher noted in his essay “[The Attitude
    of Orthodox Islam Toward the ‘Ancient Sciences’](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0202307786?ie=UTF8&tag=the-new-atlantis-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0202307786)”
    that it was not only Ash’arite but Mu’tazilite circles that “produced numerous
    polemical treatises against Aristotelian philosophy in general and against logic
    in particular.” Even before al-Ghazali’s attack on the Mu’tazilites, engaging
    in Greek philosophy was not exactly a safe task outside of auspicious but rather
    ephemeral conditions.'

    not go very far in persuading Muslims to reflect on the theological-political
    problem of Islam. For all the great help that the rediscovery of the influential
    Arabic philosophers (especially al-Farabi, Averroës, and Maimonides) would provide,
    no science-friendly Islamic tradition goes nearly far enough, to the point that
    it offers a theological renovation in the vein of Luther and Calvin — a reinterpretation
    of Islam that challenges the faith’s comprehensive ruling principles in a way
    that simultaneously convinces Muslims that they are in fact returning to the fundamentals
    of their faith.

    own past: while there are many things that the Islamic world lacks, pride in heritage
    is not one of them. What is needed in Islam is less self-pride and more self-criticism.
    Today, self-criticism in Islam is valued only insofar as it is made as an appeal
    to be more pious and less spiritually corrupt. And yet most criticism in the Muslim
    world is directed outward, at the West. This prejudice — what Fouad Ajami has
    called (referring to the Arab world) “a political tradition of belligerent self-pity”
    — is undoubtedly one of Islam’s biggest obstacles. It makes information that contradicts
    orthodox belief irrelevant, and it closes off debate about the nature and history
    of Islam.'

    and research of manuscripts of the era, may have a beneficial effect — so long
    as it is pursued in an analytical spirit. That would mean that Muslims would use
    it as a resource within their own tradition to *critically* engage with their
    philosophical, political, and founding flaws. If that occurs, it will not arise
    from any Western outreach efforts, but will be a consequence of Muslims’ own determination,
    creativity, and wisdom — in short, those very traits that Westerners rightly ascribe
    to the Muslims of the Golden Age.
