    is considerable overlap between them. All of them include the latest [Linux kernel
    6.8](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/11/linux_6_8_arrives/), they all offer
    the latest GNOME 46 desktop whose [beta we checked out in February](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/21/gnome_46_beta_released/),
    and the majority of them include the [latest KDE Plasma 6](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/29/kde_plasma_60_released/)
    desktop as well.

    We last [looked at EndeavourOS](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/29/endeavouros_artemis_226/)
    for the Artemis release in 2022\. It''s a lightweight and easier-to-install Arch-Linux-based
    distro, and since it''s a rolling release, what new releases really mean is updated
    installation media, so you don''t need to waste hours on updating once it''s installed.
    This release includes KDE Plasma 6.0.4, with a choice of X11 or Wayland sessions,
    plus new nVidia binary driver packages direct from upstream, and improved installation
    and update tools. One thing it *doesn''t* include, though, is an edition for Arm
    processors: due to a lack of manpower, the project [dropped Arm support](https://endeavouros.com/news/goodbye-endeavouros-arm/).'

    as we predicted when we [looked at the release candidate](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/fedora_40_at_rc_stage/).
    We covered the highlights then, but it may be worth noting a few things that have
    been removed from this version, including Delta RPMs, OpenSSL 1.1, and Python
    3.7\. Fedora 40's default is now Python 3.12, since 3.7 is end of life – but although
    it too has expired and gone to meet its maker, Python 3.6 *is* still available,
    in case you need to target RHEL 8.

    in a profusion of different editions. The family has five main variants: [Fedora
    Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) is the flagship GNOME desktop,
    plus ten more [Fedora Spins](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/) with different
    desktops and an additional four more [Atomic Desktops](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/),

    and its immutable sibling [Fedora Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/),

    in there. Although Fedora doesn't have LTS releases as such, it is the upstream
    for the somewhat-maligned [CentOS Stream](https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/10/centos_stream_9/),
    which is Red Hat's slower-moving free enterprise distro. Many Red Hat users favored
    Stream's predecessor, CentOS Linux, for its much closer RHEL compatibility, but
    even so, CentOS Stream has some *very* large scale users. For example, the [Building
    the Future](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x/presentations/building-future-centos-stream)
    talk at the [2022 South California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/19x)
    confirmed that Facebook parent Meta uses CentOS Stream extensively. Fedora 40
    is going to be the basis for the future CentOS Stream 10, which in turn means
    that one day it will become RHEL 10.

    This is a long-term support release, so some people will be using this at least
    until 2026 or so – although users of the current LTS, [22.04 "Jammy Jellfish"](https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/21/ubuntu_22_04/),
    won't get a message offering to upgrade until 24.04.1, which is planned to appear
    on August 15th. If you are using 23.10, though – perhaps in an attempt to get
    fewer nags about Ubuntu Pro – you will get nudged much sooner.

    by default. It also includes [frame pointers by default](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-performance-engineering-with-frame-pointers-by-default),
    which has a very small performance overhead – less than a per cent – but enables
    profiling with [bpftrace](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/introduction-bpftrace)

    installer, with improved installation automation support. "Noble" offers experimental
    support for TPM-backed full-disk encryption, and for guided installation onto
    ZFS. Noble supports Intel's QuickAssist compression and cryptography acceleration
    if the host machine has the [appropriate Intel chippery](https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/25/intel_xeon_d_openvino/).

    projects. The *Reg* FOSS desk has not looked at all the flavors yet. Two flavors
    have new releases of their respective desktops. [Ubuntu Kylin 24.04](https://www.ubuntukylin.com/news/ubuntukylin2404-en.html)
    offers [UKUI 4](https://www.ukui.org/news/shownews.php?id=129&lang=en), which
    although underrated in the West is one of the more attractive Linux desktops out
    there. [Ubuntu Cinnamon 24.04](https://ubuntucinnamon.org/?p=1310) includes the
    [Cinnamon 6 desktop](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/01/cinnamon_6_kde_6b/)
    from the latest LinuxMint. Alongside the differences in Lubuntu and Kubuntu, which
    we already covered, there are interesting changes in Xubuntu and Ubuntu Unity,
    which we plan to return to in the near future.

    at home users, media servers and so on. ®
