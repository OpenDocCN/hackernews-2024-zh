    and [MX Master mouse](https://robservatory.com/review-logitech-mx-master-2s-mouse/)
    (though I've now updated to version 3 of the mouse). And generally, their software
    has been pretty good, too.

- en: But a recent update added an "AI Prompt generator" feature to the mouse side
    of things, which is absolute garbage—I'm not saying it's bad, as I've never tried
    it. It's garbage as in there's no reason my mouse needs an AI prompt generator
    connected to a button. Even worse, as [Stephen Hackett discovered](https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/),
    it creates a folder (at the top level of your home folder, no less!) with the
    ugly name of `ai_overlay_tmp`.

    be an AI generator option in the Logi Options+ app any more. (Alternatively, Stephen
    points out you can use [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html)
    to program the buttons on the Logitech.)
