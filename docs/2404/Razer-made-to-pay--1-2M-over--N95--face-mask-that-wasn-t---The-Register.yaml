    the company's claims about the Zephyr mask's efficacy were pulled from thin air.
    Under a proposed settlement, Razer will have to pay $1.1 million in refunds to

- en: The problem, the FTC says, is that when Razer set about promoting the product
    as "N95-grade" ahead of release toward the end of 2021, when fears about COVID-19
    still ran high, it transpired that the company "never even submitted them for
    testing to the [Food and Drug Administration] or National Institute for Occupational
    Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the masks were never certified as N95."

  zh: FTC表示，问题在于，当雷蛇在2021年末推广产品为“N95级别”时，即使当时对COVID-19的担忧仍然很高，该公司“甚至从未将其提交给食品药品监督管理局（FDA）或国家职业安全健康研究所（NIOSH）进行测试，并且这些口罩从未被认证为N95级别。”
- en: N95 is a classification of NIOSH air filtration rating. N95 respirators must,
    by definition, "filter at least 95 percent of ambient air particles between .1
    and .3 micrometers in size, with even higher filtration levels for larger particles."
    If a product is not submitted to NIOSH and does not receive said rating, it would
    be "deceptive" to promote it as such, the FTC alleges.

  zh: N95是美国国家职业安全健康研究所（NIOSH）空气过滤评级的分类。按定义，N95呼吸器“至少能过滤0.1至0.3微米尺寸的空气颗粒的95%，对更大颗粒的过滤效率更高。”
    如果产品未提交给NIOSH并未获得上述评级，则宣传其为N95级别是“欺骗性的”，FTC指控说。
- en: '"These businesses falsely claimed, in the midst of a global pandemic, that
    their face mask was the equivalent of an N95 certified respirator," said Samuel
    Levine, director of the FTC''s Bureau of Consumer Protection. "The FTC will continue

    consumers who are making decisions about their health and safety."'

    [PDF] states that the Zephyr was sold in two packages, one with three sets of
    filters for $99.99, and another with 33 sets of filters for $149.99\. A top-up
    filter pack with ten sets cost $29.99\. Certified N95 respirators can be purchased
    for a fraction of this price. Razer started out selling them online and in three
    stores in Seattle, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, later selling more through limited
    online "drops."
