- en: Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong
    authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.
    A free implementation of this protocol is available from the [Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/). Kerberos is available in many commercial
    products as well.

- en: '**The Internet is an insecure place.** Many of the protocols used in the Internet
    do not provide any security. Tools to "sniff" passwords off of the network are
    in common use by malicious hackers. Thus, applications which send an unencrypted
    password over the network are extremely vulnerable. Worse yet, other client/server
    applications rely on the client program to be "honest" about the identity of the
    user who is using it. Other applications rely on the client to restrict its activities
    to those which it is allowed to do, with no other enforcement by the server.'

- en: Some sites attempt to use [firewalls](firewalls.html) to solve their network
    security problems. Unfortunately, firewalls assume that "the bad guys" are on
    the outside, which is often a very bad assumption. Most of the really damaging
    incidents of computer crime are carried out by insiders. Firewalls also have a
    significant disadvantage in that they restrict how your users can use the Internet.
    (After all, firewalls are simply a less extreme example of the dictum that there
    is nothing more secure than a computer which is not connected to the network ---
    and powered off!) In many places, these restrictions are simply unrealistic and
    unacceptable.

- en: Kerberos was created by MIT as a **solution to these network security problems**.
    The Kerberos protocol uses **strong cryptography** so that a client can prove
    its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure network connection.
    After a client and server has used Kerberos to prove their identity, they can
    also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity
    as they go about their business.

- en: Kerberos is freely available from MIT, under copyright permissions very similar
    those used for the BSD operating system and the X Window System. MIT provides
    Kerberos in source form so that anyone who wishes to use it may look over the
    code for themselves and assure themselves that the code is trustworthy. In addition,
    for those who prefer to rely on a professionally supported product, Kerberos is
    available as a product from many different vendors.

- en: In summary, Kerberos is a solution to your network security problems. It provides
    the tools of authentication and strong cryptography over the network to help you
    secure your information systems across your entire enterprise. We hope you find
    Kerberos as useful as it has been to us. At MIT, Kerberos has been invaluable
    to our Information/Technology architecture.
