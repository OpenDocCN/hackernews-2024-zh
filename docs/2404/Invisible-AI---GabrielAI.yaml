    screen coherently, articulately, and it aimed (or at least tried) to execute tasks
    precisely as instructed. It seemed magical.

    steps, limiting the extent to which we can delegate tasks to AI systems.

- en: We designed [GabrielAI](https://getgabrielai.com) to be an invisible AI. Our
    focus is on emails and communication. GabrielAI assists in managing email inboxes,
    filters new emails and automatically drafts possible responses.

    taking any action. The human's responsibility is to review the draft and send
    it.

    to manually type and craft entire emails. In most cases, an AI can draft an email
    better than a human, so we let the AI handle it.

    GabrielAI of which emails to filter, how to reply to each email, and provide all
    necessary information. However, after this initial setup, GabrielAI operates as
    an invisible AI.

    or of such low value that they do not require human intervention. In fact, human
    intervention would decrease the value of automation.

    This feature is not overseen by a human; the system automatically adds labels
