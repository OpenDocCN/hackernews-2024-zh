    screen coherently, articulately, and it aimed (or at least tried) to execute tasks
    precisely as instructed. It seemed magical.

    steps, limiting the extent to which we can delegate tasks to AI systems.

    intervention. It eliminates the first step mentioned above, "Prompting the system."

    takes the correct action without human prompting.

- en: We designed [GabrielAI](https://getgabrielai.com) to be an invisible AI. Our
    focus is on emails and communication. GabrielAI assists in managing email inboxes,
    filters new emails and automatically drafts possible responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Upon receiving an email, users find a drafted response in their inbox without
    taking any action. The human's responsibility is to review the draft and send
    it.

- en: This approach saves users valuable mental energy and time. Users no longer need
    to manually type and craft entire emails. In most cases, an AI can draft an email
    better than a human, so we let the AI handle it.

- en: The trade-off is the initial setup required by the user. The user must inform
    GabrielAI of which emails to filter, how to reply to each email, and provide all
    necessary information. However, after this initial setup, GabrielAI operates as
    an invisible AI.

    or of such low value that they do not require human intervention. In fact, human
    intervention would decrease the value of automation.

    This feature is not overseen by a human; the system automatically adds labels
    to emails if instructed to do so.
