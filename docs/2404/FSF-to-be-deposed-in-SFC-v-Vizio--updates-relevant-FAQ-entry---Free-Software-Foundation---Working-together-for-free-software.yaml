    Questions about the GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html.en)"
    have been an important educational resource about the GNU General Public Licenses
    (GPL).

- en: Unfortunately, Vizio, Inc., an American publicly traded company that designs
    and sells televisions, sound bars, viewer data, and advertising, has attempted
    to exploit the FSF's FAQs to the detriment of software freedom in the case [*Software
    Freedom Conservancy (SFC), Inc. vs. Vizio, Inc.*](https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/vizio.html)
    (case no. 30-2021-01226723-CU-BC-CJC). In this case, SFC is requesting that Vizio
    provide source code to programs on some Vizio devices that are covered by the
    GNU General Public License v2 (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1
    (LGPL). In response, Vizio has argued that SFC cannot enforce a request for source
    code if it does not hold copyright to the underlying software. In support of that
    argument, Vizio has made reference to an FAQ that is captioned ["Who has the power
    to enforce the GPL."](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhoHasThePower)

    software — which requires that source code be shared with users.

- en: Vizio's attempt to leverage an FSF FAQ to avoid being held accountable under
    the GNU GPL is both malicious and ironic. Users should be free to enforce their
    right to source code under the GNU GPL licenses through any available legal mechanism,
    without having to rely on a copyright holder to take action.

    for obtaining complete and corresponding source code, as is their right, and enforcing
    full compliance with the GNU GPL. After all, we developed the GNU GPL to make
    software free for all its users.

    We will continue to closely monitor the case, and we support the SFC in their
    efforts. Needless to say, a court decision confirming users' standing to enforce
    their right to source code under the GNU GPL licenses would be a great help in
    ensuring software freedom.

    of the GNU GPL licenses, which includes extensive preparation for this deposition
    with legal counsel. Please consider making a [financial contribution](https://www.fsf.org/donate)
    to enable us to continue doing this work. If you don't have the financial means,
    you can also contribute to the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org), or help investigate
    [possible GPL violations](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html).
