# This is a teenager

The world has a lot of compassion for kids.

When we're young, we have so little control over their lives. We play around, mess up, and get into trouble. We also endure dysfunctional homes, family chaos, violence, bullies, and whatever else comes our way. But we tell ourselves that, eventually, we'll get to shape our own lives.

Then we turn 18 and we're expected to be "adults" and figure things out.

If we fail, we are punished.

We are blamed for not going to college, for being unhealthy, for being poor, for not being able to afford healthcare and food and housing.
