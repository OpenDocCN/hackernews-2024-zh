    cites the “considerable controversy, harassment, misinformation, and strife” of
    corporate-run social media in asking the government to use [open-source alternatives
    like ActivityPub](/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network),
    the social protocol used by Mastodon (and which [US President Biden is now posting
    into](/2024/4/2/24119353/joe-biden-threads-mastodon-activitypub-fediverse)...
    from Threads), for communication, instead.
