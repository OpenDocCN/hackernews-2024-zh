    against Apple, alleging a pattern of unfair and coercive conduct, largely but
    not entirely centered around the iPhone. As part of the claim outside of the smartphone,
    the Antitrust Division [asserted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline)
    that “Apple’s conduct extends beyond just monopoly profits and even affects the
    flow of speech. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its role as a TV and movie
    producer and has exercised that role to control content.” Some economists mocked
    the suit, suggesting, among other things, that political power should have no
    role in analysis of how monopolies function.

    night, Jon Stewart interviewed Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan on the
    Daily Show. Stewart, after a long hiatus, which included a stint doing a podcast
    for Apple TV+, resumed hosting the show he made famous, even if only one night
    a week. During the interview with Khan, he said that Apple had blocked him from
    interviewing her while he was at Apple. "They literally said, please don't talk
    to her,” he offered. Stewart also noted that Apple had told him not to do segments
    on artificial intelligence, adding to his earlier [complaints](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-lawmakers-question-apple-over-jon-stewarts-china-content-2023-11-15/)

    In that case, a Rhode Island commission was in charge of banning books, but didn’t

    ask "cooperation" from the distributor of books, advise the distributor that “lists
    of ‘objectionable’ publications were circulated to local police departments,”
