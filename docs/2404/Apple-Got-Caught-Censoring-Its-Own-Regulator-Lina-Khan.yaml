- en: Two weeks ago, the Department of Justice filed an [antitrust suit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline)
    against Apple, alleging a pattern of unfair and coercive conduct, largely but
    not entirely centered around the iPhone. As part of the claim outside of the smartphone,
    the Antitrust Division [asserted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline)
    that “Apple’s conduct extends beyond just monopoly profits and even affects the
    flow of speech. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its role as a TV and movie
    producer and has exercised that role to control content.” Some economists mocked
    the suit, suggesting, among other things, that political power should have no
    role in analysis of how monopolies function.

    night, Jon Stewart interviewed Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan on the
    Daily Show. Stewart, after a long hiatus, which included a stint doing a podcast
    for Apple TV+, resumed hosting the show he made famous, even if only one night
    a week. During the interview with Khan, he said that Apple had blocked him from
    interviewing her while he was at Apple. "They literally said, please don't talk
    to her,” he offered. Stewart also noted that Apple had told him not to do segments
    on artificial intelligence, adding to his earlier [complaints](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-lawmakers-question-apple-over-jon-stewarts-china-content-2023-11-15/)
    about Apple’s refusal to sanction discussions of China.

    it, or otherwise manipulates speech. And some of that is just griping. But you
    know a corporation has too much power over speech, and exercises it, when its
    executives feels they can censor their own regulator. And Apple clearly does feel
    that way.

- en: It’s a wide-ranging interview, in which Khan and Stewart discuss everything
    from inhalers to antitrust to big tech. And it’s worth watching. But the key moment
    was when Stewart asked Khan why Apple would do something like that. And she responded,
    “I think it just shows one of the dangers of what happens when you concentrate
    so much power and so much decision-making in a small number of companies.”

    its streaming service from commenting on China. When I was in Hollywood last year,
    censorship on behalf of China by all the streamers, especially Apple, was a constant
    complaint. There are obvious reasons, as Apple is de facto controlled by the Chinese
    government.

    from [discussing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-apple-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-says-apple-rejected-its-attempt-to-tell-users-about-app-store-fees-idUSKBN25O042/?il=0)
    its 30% app store fee, and has historically sought to limit political speech,
    as when it blocked an app that [catalogued](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/28/after-12-rejections-apple-accepts-app-that-tracks-u-s-drone-strikes/)
    U.S. drone strikes as “excessively objectionable or crude.” Indeed, as part of
    why people should care about the Apple suit, I [wrote](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/why-the-apple-antitrust-suit-matters)
    that the “corporation has become a dangerous corporation, with designs on imposing
    an authoritarian vision over as much of the economy as it can get away with.”
    And we see, with Khan and Stewart, a blindingly obvious example.

    and China worked, as long as Stewart worked at Apple. But eventually he left,

    is a powerful media figure and Khan is probably the most famous regulator in America.
    Most of us are not empowered, and can’t command the media or legal resources to
    make ourselves heard. Stewart had the ability to get Paramount to broadcast his
    show, but who is to say that a less powerful media figure might not have encountered
    Paramount executives afraid of running afoul of Apple? The threat of retaliation
    is overwhelming, and even if it weren’t, it shouldn’t be frightening to exercise
    the basic right of speech.

    I receive from any discussion of a monopolist who engages in coercive behavior,
    whether Ticketmaster or a PBM or a big tech firm, is ‘that’s exactly how things
    work in MY industry.’ And that is true. Apple isn’t an isolated incident.

    information. And control of speech has always been a fundamental part of big tech’s
    DNA. Indeed, in 2009, before it had even found its business model, Mark Zuckerberg
    was a notorious censor. Facebook users had revolted against a new privacy policy,
    forming a group called “Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service.” Mark
    Zuckerberg apologized, then ignored their demands and [promptly](https://archive.epic.org/testimony/congress/EPIC-HEC-Facebook-Apr2018.pdf)
    deleted the group, implementing a policy whereby users could no longer form groups
    with Facebook in the name to block organizing on the site against his firm.

    that limit the flow of ad dollars. Right now, a site I used to write for, one
    of the best sources for information during the financial crisis, Naked Capitalism,
    is being strangled by a [Google algorithm](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/03/google-censorship-ai-run-amok-threatens-demonetization-over-a-navigation-page-with-no-ads-an-article-on-a-foreign-policy-best-seller-deemed-anti-vaxx-and-more-flagrant-errors.html)
    that falsely determined the [site](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2024/03/google-demands-that-we-censor-our-content.html)

    [killed en masse](https://twitter.com/JonMiksis/status/1772374109747331548), without
    the resources or capacity that Khan and Stewart have. And there’s little anyone
    can do, except hope that a cowardly judge overseeing the Google antitrust case
    named Amit Mehta in D.C. notices.

    fear of both government and corporate overreach. It’s hard to argue for more government
    authority to address corporate malfeasance, as that would extend an authority
    that most people do not trust. And yet it is the conjoining of corporate and government
    power - sometimes not even U.S. government power - that is perhaps the gravest
    threat to liberty.

    and *[NetChoice vs Paxton](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-google-facebook-and-amazon-endorse)*,
    and both turn on the power of consolidated tech platforms combined with the state.
    In *Murthy,* it’s about government officials asking social media to delete content
    around Covid, and in NetChoice, it’s about whether the government gets to make
    rules around content moderation on big tech platforms.

    control of distribution. In several cases this session, the Supreme Court justices
    are musing on a 1963 legal precedent called *[Bantam Books vs Sullivan](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/372/58/)*.
    In that case, a Rhode Island commission was in charge of banning books, but didn’t
    do so directly. Instead, the commission would deem a book ‘obscene,’ and then
    ask "cooperation" from the distributor of books, advise the distributor that “lists
    of ‘objectionable’ publications were circulated to local police departments,”
    and that they may recommend “prosecution of purveyors of obscenity.” It was an
    indirect censorship regime, done through a private book distributor. The analogies
    to big tech are obvious.

- en: The Supreme Court ruled that the state forcing a private entity to censor was
    an abridgment of free expression. But what was most interesting, and what hasn’t
    come up, is market power. You see, Rhode Island enacted its censorship law by
    talking to “the exclusive wholesale distributor of appellants publications throughout
    most of the State.” Aka this was a case about monopoly and its relationship with
    censorship. (Similar cases, like an antitrust case about [the Associated Press
    in 1945](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/1/) and one about a newspaper
    called [Lorain Journal in 1951](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/342/143/),
    are foundational when it comes to market power and speech.)

    Lieutenant General William Hilsman, former manager of the National Communications

    big tech firms like Apple and Google are far too powerful. But if it wasn’t obvious
    enough yesterday, Chair Lina Khan’s appearance on the Daily Show should give you
    another data point. If it was up to Apple, that appearance never would have happened.
    And if Apple isn’t stopped, it soon might be their choice, and not ours. It’s
    a choice they feel entitled to make for us.
