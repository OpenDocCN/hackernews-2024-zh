    letter on April 3, 2024, expressing in greater detail the concerns raised in this

    in August 2023 to its popular Terraform infrastructure-as-code tool, [OpenTofu
    set out](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu) to be the
    “open source successor to the MPLv2-licensed Terraform,” further promising that
    it “will be community-driven, impartial, layered and modular, and backward-compatible.”

    and comparing them to HashiCorp’s. Specifically, OpenTofu appears to have lifted
    Terraform code related to a new `removed` block feature first implemented in Terraform
    V1.7, which was released under the Business Software License (BUSL) a few months
    after the OpenTofu fork was created. The tell? OpenTofu took this BUSL-licensed
    HashiCorp code, removed the headers, and tried to instead relicense it under the
    Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0).

    choice of license, but you don’t have the right to take someone else’s code and
    rip-and-replace their license.

    support from more than 140 organizations, among them Cloudflare, Harness, Oracle,
    and GitLab. Of course, the [core maintainers](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/MAINTAINERS)
    mostly came from direct HashiCorp competitors (Spacelift, env0) that had built
    their businesses on Terraform and were upset by HashiCorp’s license change. Fair
    enough.

    even as it called out soon-to-be-released features like client-side state encryption
    that Terraform didn’t have. Despite the optimistic start, however, the team soon
    [began to realize the difficulty](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/874) of
    implementing the feature. Security is hard. (Maybe HashiCorp wasn’t dumb, after
    all.)

    assembled group of relatively small companies (and [none of the major cloud vendors](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3705094/follow-the-cloud-money.html)),
    perhaps it was. After all, whatever one may think about HashiCorp’s license change,
    the company has spent a decade building the product. The engineering muscle behind
    such an effort doesn’t spring to life in a few months, whatever the high-flying
    ideals of founders.

    a major new feature: `removed` block automation, which lets Terraform better manage
    resource deletion. Think of it as a [config-driven approach](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#removing-resources)
    to `terraform state rm`. However, the feature itself, while cool, isn’t the point.
    The timing of that feature is. Importantly, this feature was introduced in late
    November 2023 *after* HashiCorp switched to the BUSL. If someone wanted to use
    the `removed` block functionality, they couldn’t get it under the MPL.'

    to have deleted some comments in a few files. Maybe it matters that they seem
    to have changed a line here or there. Perhaps one could credibly argue that OpenTofu
    has not, in fact, created derivative works of Terraform’s BUSL-licensed code.
    Perhaps.

    the code in question was licensed under the MPL. Except it wasn’t. Ever. All of
    the code in question was released *after* HashiCorp moved to BUSL for Terraform.
    At best, the OpenTofu community has engaged in wishful thinking, desperately hoping
    it could retroactively make BUSL-licensed code magically become MPL-licensed code.
    At worst, the OpenTofu developers deceitfully misappropriated HashiCorp’s intellectual
    property and tried to make it their own.

    of a positive, “community-driven approach” and definitely doesn’t show “the value
    of open source,” as the Linux Foundation press release proclaims. It looks a lot
    like a violation of HashiCorp’s intellectual property. It’s completely fair for
    OpenTofu to disagree with HashiCorp’s license change and fork the project; it’s
    completely illegal for OpenTofu or anyone else to take HashiCorp’s code and apply
    whatever license they prefer.
