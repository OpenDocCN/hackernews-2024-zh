    that he thought he might die. That summer, after he recovered, he returned to
    the string quartet he’d been writing before his illness—Quartet No. 15 in A Minor,
    Op. 132—and added a new segment inspired by his survival. To this day, the piece
    is known for the slowly unfolding, baffled joy of its third movement, where the
    music seems to trace the shuffling steps of an invalid breathing fresh air for
    the first time in weeks. Beethoven would call it *Heiliger Dankgesang*, a “[holy
    song of thanksgiving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYQrSokI6es).”

    copyist, who’d write it all out again, this time legibly. After Beethoven corrected
    any mistakes the copyist made—berating the man the whole time—the score would
    go to a publishing house where, after more last-minute changes from the composer,
    an engraver would trace it, backwards, onto a copper sheet. From there, the score
    would be published and republished, appearing in largely the same form on music
    stands across the world even to this day.

    to know was not exactly the Opus 132 that Beethoven handed to his copyist. The
    composer littered his original score with unusual markings that the copyist simply
    ignored. Below one staff, for example, Beethoven jotted “ffmo”—a tag that wasn’t
    a standard part of musical notation, and wasn't used by any other major composer.
    In another place, he drew an odd shape like an elongated diamond, also a nonstandard
    notation. None of these marks made it into even the first clean copy, let alone
    the published version. Almost no one would see those marks in the roughly 200
    years after Beethoven first scribbled them down.
