    from the Linux ecosystem into a release that is built to empower open source developers
    and deliver innovation for the next 12 years.

    ambitious interim releases, experimenting with new approaches to security (and
    tackling [last minute CVEs](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xz-liblzma-security-update-post-2/43801)),
    evolving our core desktop apps, and continuing our commitment to performance and
    compatibility across a wide array of hardware supported by the brand new Linux
    6.8 kernel.

    We look forward to extending and expanding on what we’ve delivered today both
    within the lifecycle of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and in future releases, always considering
    how we can live up to [our mission](https://ubuntu.com/about), and [the values](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-desktop-charting-a-course-for-the-future)

    still one of our biggest priorities. Whilst today Ubuntu ships pre-installed on
    millions of desktops, laptops and workstations around the world thanks to our
    partnerships with OEMs like Dell, HP and Lenovo, more than ten times as many users
    install the operating system themselves each year. Here’s what we’re adding to
    simplify Ubuntu installations.

    back end as Ubuntu server, creating a consistent codebase across both platforms
    to deliver feature parity and easier maintainability. This is complemented by
    a brand new front end built in Flutter which has been iterated on significantly
    over the past year to improve access to accessibility options, increase clarity
    on the user experience and deliver a polished and improved experience.

    option and added support for ZFS encryption. We’ve also added improved guidance
    for dual-boot setups, particularly in relation to BitLocker. One major request
    from users has been support for hardware-backed full disk encryption and it makes
    its first appearance in an experimental form in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. This implementation
    has certain limitations at launch which restrict its use to those devices that
    only require a generic kernel with no third party drivers or kernel modules, and
    does not currently support firmware upgrades. We intend to extend the hardware
    compatibility of this feature over time within the lifecycle of this release,
    with support for NVIDIA drivers as our first priority.

    support in the graphical installer. Users or enterprises who want to create a
    customised, repeatable, automated installation flow can now provide the address
    of a local or remote autoinstall.yaml file and let Subiquity take over from there.

    Center (also flutter-based) is another notable highlight, bringing a modern, more
    performant new look to app discovery with clearer categories and application management
    functionality. Since its [initial launch](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-desktop-23-10-mantic-minotaur-deep-dive),
    the App Center now includes a new ratings service to allow users to vote on the
    quality of their apps and view an aggregated score from other users. These scores,
    combined with the other rich meta-data available from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/),
    will make it easier for us to deliver additional discovery mechanisms such as
    top charts, most popular or recently updated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to deliver these usability features, you can still use it to find and install
    deb packages via the search toggles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As part of the new App Center development we’ve split out firmware updates into
    their own dedicated app. This not only allows a richer experience managing firmware
    but also improves performance since the old Ubuntu Software application would
    need to remain permanently running in the background to check for new firmware
    on previous releases.

    on desktop, unifying the stack across server and cloud where Netplan has been
    the default since 2016\. This change enables administrators to consistently configure
    their Ubuntu estate regardless of platform. With the recent release of Netplan
    1.0, all platforms also benefit from new features around wireless compatibility
    and usability improvements such as netplan status –diff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not impact workflows that prefer the previous configuration methods. NetworkManager
    has bidirectional integration with Netplan, meaning changes made in either configuration
    are updated and reflected in both.

    we are continuing to invest in enterprise tooling for [Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem

    enabling administrators to seed custom config files on their developer’s machines

    existing import/export workflows and represents the first step toward future management

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Underneath the hood, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS also includes a number of security improvements
    for those developing and distributing software within the Ubuntu ecosystem. In
    Ubuntu 23.10 we landed [a new version of software-properties](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/improvements-to-ppa-management-in-23-10/35783)
    that changed the way Personal Package Archives (PPAs) are managed on Ubuntu.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PPAs are a critical tool for development, testing and customisation, enabling
    users to install software outside of the official Ubuntu archives. This allows
    for a great deal of software freedom but also comes with potential security risks
    due to the access they are granted to your OS. In Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, PPAs are now
    distributed as deb822-formatted.sources files with their signing key directly
    embedded into the file’s signed-by field. This establishes a 1:1 relationship
    between the key and the repository, meaning one key cannot be used to sign multiple
    repositories and removing a repository also removes its associated key. In addition,
    APT now requires repositories to be signed using stronger public key algorithms.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another significant security enhancement is the restriction of unprivileged
    user namespaces. These are a widely used feature of the Linux kernel that provide
    additional security isolation for applications that construct their own sandboxes,
    such as browsers which would then use that space to execute untrusted web content.
    So far so good, however the ability to create unprivileged user namespaces can
    expose additional attack surfaces within the Linux kernel and has proven to be
    a step in a significant number of exploits. In Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, AppAmor is now
    used to selectively control access to unprivileged user namespaces on a per application
    basis so that only applications with legitimate need can leverage this functionality.

    their release to the wider Ubuntu user base. In the past this pocket has been
    an all-or-nothing experience, with users who opt in to updates from proposed needing
    to take all updates that were available. As a result the chance of introducing
    system instability was significantly increased, disincentivising those who wanted
    to provide testing support for specific features in advance of their wider availability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Ubuntu 24.04 LTS we have lowered the default apt priority of updates in “proposed”
    to allow users to specify exactly which packages they want to install and which
    they want to remain stable. This change is designed to increase the confidence
    of users who want to test specific features ahead of their general release.
