    clicking on each app individually. Apple's help falls short.

    and the steps required are scattered in different places. There’s no clear direction
    on whether to go to the app settings, the central settings – or even both,’ says **Amel
    Bourdoucen**, a doctoral researcher at Aalto.

    users and asked them to try changing the settings.

    from sharing their data with other applications or the service provider,’ Bourdoucen
    says.

    adjustments, users don't get feedback on whether they’ve succeeded. They then
    get lost along the way, go backwards in the process and scroll randomly, not knowing
    if they've done enough,’ Bourdoucen says.

    steps in the right direction, but none succeeded in following the whole procedure
    to protect their privacy.

    possible to conclude that the data will be used to train the artificial intelligence
    system behind Siri and to provide personalised user experiences, among other things.

- en: Many users are used to seamless multi-device interaction, which makes it difficult
    to move back to a time of more limited data sharing. However, Apple could inform
    users much more clearly than it does today, says Lindqvist. The study lists a
    number of detailed suggestions to clarify privacy settings and improve guidelines.

    by opting for a third-party service. For example, some participants in the study
    had switched from Safari to Firefox.

- en: Lindqvist can’t comment directly on how Google's Android works in similar respects,
    as no one has yet done a similar mapping of its apps. But past research on third-party
    apps does not suggest that Google is any more privacy-conscious than Apple.
