    law against recording telephone conversations without the permission of both sides
    of the call, ruling that law enforcement officers performing their official duties

    felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63, of Floral City.
    Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his property with the
    Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018\. The situation escalated after
    wildlife officers – accompanied by deputies holding rifles – sprayed herbicides
    in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along Waite’s property in west-central
    Florida.

    County Sheriff's Office 就其财产使用权问题存在长期争议。在这之后，野生动物官员与持步枪的副警长在佛罗里达州中西部韦特财产沿维斯拉库奇河的一个运河中喷洒除草剂，情况进一步升级。
