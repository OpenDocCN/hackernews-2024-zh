- en: A Florida appeals court has effectively opened a loophole in the state's long-standing
    law against recording telephone conversations without the permission of both sides
    of the call, ruling that law enforcement officers performing their official duties
    can be secretly recorded because they have no expectation of privacy.

    Office of misconduct – is the latest to provide new mechanisms for civilian oversight
    of law enforcement, even as others were curtailed in recent days by Gov. Ron DeSantis
    and the Republican-led Legislature.

- en: last week, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach threw out five
    felony wiretapping convictions against Michael Leroy Waite, 63, of Floral City.
    Waite has been engaged in a lengthy dispute over access to his property with the
    Citrus County Sheriff's Office as far back as 2018\. The situation escalated after
    wildlife officers – accompanied by deputies holding rifles – sprayed herbicides
    in a canal off the Withlacoochee River along Waite’s property in west-central
    Florida.

    pointed assault rifles at me as they ripped up and stole my ‘No Trespassing’ signs,”
    Waite said in an interview. He called the court’s decision groundbreaking: “I
    think a lot of people are going to be citing my case in the future,” he said.'

    they were in fear that this guy was going to do something, try to shoot them,
    try to kill them,” deputy Ryan Glaze testified in the case. Glaze said Waite had
    “sovereign citizen ideologies,” referring to the anti-government movement whose
    followers believe that courts have no jurisdiction over them.

    only time I ever used the word ‘sovereign’ was to claim my private property is
    not state sovereignty land.”

    incident by the sheriff and said he wanted to have the call recorded for a complaint
    against the sheriff. That same day, Sergeant Edward Blair called Waite back –
    and Waite recorded the three-minute phone conversation but did not inform Blair
    he was doing so, the court said.

    and requested an internal investigation. A month later, Waite was accused of five
    counts of illegal wiretapping for recording the conversation with the sergeant

    telephone conversations of other government employees in Florida conducting official
    business. It said Waite’s recording was allowed because there was “no dispute
    that all conversations concerned matters of public business, occurred while the
    deputies were on duty, and involved phones utilized for work purposes.”
