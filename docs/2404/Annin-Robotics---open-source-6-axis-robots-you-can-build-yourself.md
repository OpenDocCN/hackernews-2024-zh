# Annin Robotics - open source 6 axis robots you can build yourself

> 来源：[https://www.anninrobotics.com](https://www.anninrobotics.com)

The Annin Robotics AR4 robot is a 6DOF desktop size industrial robot that is a free, open plan low cost robot.  Anyone can make this robots and it can be made using aluminum components or you can 3D print the parts yourself.

​

These robots are widely used in small automation processes and in hundreds of high schools, technical schools and colleges in a variety of educational programs and hobbyist communities.

​

​

​

​

The 3D print files, operating software and assembly manuals can all be found on our downloads page for free.

​

Aluminum parts and hardware kits are available

on our kits page.

​

The goal of the AR series robots is to create the lowest cost robot possible so that anyone can build a 6 axis robot arm for fun, educational purposes or small production operations.

​

The AR4 robot arm uses an Arduino based teensy 4.1 control board and used free open code python control software.

​

My goal is to continue improving the software and functionality and provide the lowest cost solution for a 6 axis robot that can actually be used for real tasks.
