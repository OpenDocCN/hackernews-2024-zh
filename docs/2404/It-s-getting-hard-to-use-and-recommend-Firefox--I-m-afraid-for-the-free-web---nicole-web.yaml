    up using Chromium. I tried using Firefox and it looked good on my end: I could
    see and hear the other person. But they just saw a blank video feed and heard
    nothing. Firefox showed me that it''s sending, but it never goes through to them.
    This happened with Google Meet, a body doubling platform, and a telehealth platform,
    all using different underlying video services.'

- en: I'm a software engineer, and I run Fedora on my personal laptop. This [particular
    bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1875201) was on the latest version,
    and by running a bleeding-edge distribution I got cut. I didn't have the same
    issue on my work laptop, running an LTS version of Ubuntu. So in some ways, it's
    a problem of my own making, and there was [a workaround](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/firefox-122-workaround-to-fix-google-meet-issue/103667).

- en: But that's the problem. I have to be so *careful* about which version of Firefox
    I have installed, because things break tremendously now and then. Even on the
    bleeding edge, a showstopper bug like this one—and this is not the first time
    something similar has happened to me—means that I *cannot* rely on having Firefox
    around as my only browser. I have to have everything setup in Chromium as well,
    because Firefox *will* let me down.

- en: In some ways, the constant breakage is not Firefox's fault. When web applications
    are only tested in Chromium, they will inevitably have bugs that are showstoppers
    in non-Chrome browsers. Yet other problems do seem to be Firefox's fault, like
    this issue with video calls. But at the end of the day, **it doesn't matter whose
    fault it is**. If users cannot reliably use a browser for everyday tasks, they
    will switch and never look back. Whether they move to Chrome or Edge or Brave,
    those are all Chrome under the hood.

- en: It's gettin gharder to keep using Firefox, but I do, because preserving the
    free web requires that we have more stakeholders than just Google (and Apple).
    We used to have Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla all at the table to prserve
    the free web. But now Microsoft uses the Chromium engine, and while Apple is a
    strong influence thanks to iOS, that influence may erode due to European regulators
    compelling them to allow alternative browser engines on iOS.

- en: It's almost impossible to argue for other people using Firefox. The abstract
    damage of the loss of the free web, of handing control to Google, is intangible
    and pales in comparison to the real pains of using a lesser browser daily. We're
    too removed from the benefits of browser engine diversity right now to make the
    case.

  zh: 目前几乎不可能为其他人使用 Firefox 辩护。自由网络的抽象损失，将控制权交给 Google，这些问题虽然无法触及，但与每天使用较差的浏览器带来的真实痛苦相比，其影响微不足道。我们目前对浏览器引擎多样性的好处过于远离，难以提出有力的论据。
- en: I hope that under Mozilla's new CEO, they'll recover their footing. They're
    leaning into data privacy. Not everyone cares about it, but enough people do that
    maybe we'll regain a clear pitch for Firefox for regular everyday user. For now,
    I'm still defaulting to Firefox, but it's harder with each showstopper bug. And
    someday, maybe I won't open it first anymore.

  zh: 希望在 Mozilla 的新 CEO 领导下，他们能够重新站稳脚跟。他们正在重视数据隐私。并非每个人都关心这一点，但关注的人足够多，也许我们将重新找回
    Firefox 对普通日常用户的明确定位。目前，我仍然默认使用 Firefox，但每次遇到重大错误都让人犹豫不决。也许，总有一天，我会改变不再首选它了。
