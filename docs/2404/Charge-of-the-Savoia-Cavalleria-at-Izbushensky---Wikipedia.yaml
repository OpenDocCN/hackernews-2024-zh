    the Italian cavalry [Regiment "Savoia Cavalleria" (3rd)](/wiki/Regiment_%22Savoia_Cavalleria%22_(3rd)
    "Regiment "Savoia Cavalleria" (3rd)") and the [Soviet](/wiki/Soviet "Soviet")
    812th Rifle Regiment ([304th Rifle Division](/wiki/304th_Rifle_Division_(Soviet_Union)
    "304th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)")) that took place on August 24, 1942, near
    the hamlet (khutor) of [Izbushensky](/wiki/Izbushensky "Izbushensky") (*Избушенский*),
    close to the junction between the [Don](/wiki/Don_River_(Russia) "Don River (Russia)")
    and [Khopyor](/wiki/Khopyor_River "Khopyor River") rivers. Though a minor skirmish
    in the theatre of operation of the [Eastern Front](/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)
    "Eastern Front (World War II)"), the Izbushensky charge had great propaganda resonance
    in Italy and it is still remembered as one of the last significant [cavalry](/wiki/Cavalry
    "Cavalry") [charges](/wiki/Charge_(warfare) "Charge (warfare)") in history.

    "Don River (Russia)"). The [Italian 2nd Infantry Division *Sforzesca*](/wiki/2nd_Infantry_Division_Sforzesca
    "2nd Infantry Division Sforzesca") was unable to withstand the enemy attack and
    in two days it was routed.^([[1]](#cite_note-1)) The Regiment "Savoia Cavalleria"
    (3rd) under command of Colonel Alessandro, Count Bettoni Cazzago, was sent as
    a relief force in the area, with orders to occupy "objective spot height 213,5".
    During the evening of 23 August, it set camp 1,000 meters short of its objective,
    ready to occupy it the next morning. During the night, two battalions (first and
    second)^([[2]](#cite_note-BD304-2)) of the Soviet 812th Rifle Regiment deployed
    on the objective. They entrenched themselves in an arc facing the Italian camp
    about 1,000 meters wide, waiting until sunrise to attack.

    sent to recon the objective, made contact with the Soviets. The Soviets, having
    lost the element of surprise, opened fire on the entire line. With the camp under
    fire, Alessandro had no choice but to order, as a last resort, a cavalry charge
    with drawn sabers and hand grenades against entrenched infantry. While the horse
    drawn artillery (so called "flying batteries" or *voloire* in [Piemontese](/wiki/Piedmontese_language
    "Piedmontese language")) quickly deployed its four pieces and opened fire, the
    machine guns deployed at the front of the Italian camp and started firing back.
    Alessandro Bettoni then ordered the 2nd [squadron](/wiki/Squadron_(army) "Squadron
    (army)") (over 100 horsemen) to attack the Soviet left flank. Under the command
    of Captain De Leone, the squadron began a winding maneuver through a gorge, succeeding
    in engaging the Soviets at the left end of the front, outflanking it and storming
    it longitudinally with drawn sabers and hand grenades.

    of the Soviet line the strength of the squadron was already reduced by half, and

    through his binoculars that the Soviet riflemen, after the horsemen had jumped
    over their holes, would get up and shoot at their backs, Colonel Bettoni ordered
    the 4th squadron to dismount and launch a frontal attack. This would allow the
    2nd squadron to regroup behind Soviet lines and perform a return charge. The 4th
    squadron was led by Captain [Silvano Abba](/wiki/Silvano_Abba "Silvano Abba"),
    who was killed while leading his men. He was posthumously awarded the [Gold Medal
    of Military Valor](/wiki/Gold_Medal_of_Military_Valor "Gold Medal of Military
    Valor"). Once the 2nd squadron was back, its commander urged a new attack. This
    was performed by 3rd squadron, led by the impatient Captain Marchio, who rushed
    frontally at the Soviets without taking the detour through the gorge at the side
    of the battlefield. Major Alberto Litta Modignani decided on his own accord to
    join the 3rd squadron charge, together with the remaining dozen horsemen of the
    command.

    From the Soviet side, 304th Rifle Division battle report No. 2 from August 24th
    preliminary evaluates Italian losses for that day as up to 500 dead.^([[2]](#cite_note-BD304-2))
    The Soviets, by Italian records, left behind 150 dead, 300 wounded, 600 prisoners
    (including some Mongolian platoons equipped with Italian uniforms, which had been
    taken from the Sforzesca division), 4 cannons, 10 mortars and 50 machine guns.^([[5]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-5))
    From the Soviet perspective, 304th Rifle Division operational report No. 70 from
    the early hours of August 25th tolls the losses taken by the whole division for

    dead horses. The relatively high casualties that would have resulted from pursuing
    the Soviet troops would have had the effect of precluding the launching of any
    more charges, should the need arise. Given this consideration, Commander Bettoni
    decided not to pursue the Soviets, who therefore retained a solid foothold on
    the west bank of the Don River. Nonetheless, the "Izbushensky Charge", as it was
    subsequently named, temporarily relieved the whole area of Soviet pressure, delayed
    the full Soviet attack on Tschebotarewskij by 24 hours, and likely bought time
    for the routed "Sforzesca" division to seek safety.^([[5]](#cite_note-autogenerated1-5))
