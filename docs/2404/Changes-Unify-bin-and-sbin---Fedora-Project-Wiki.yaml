- en: The `/usr/sbin` directory becomes a symlink to `bin`, which means paths like
    `/usr/bin/foo` and `/usr/sbin/foo` point to the same place. `/bin` and `/sbin`
    are already symlinks to `usr/bin` and `usr/sbin`, so effectively `/bin/foo` and
    `/sbin/foo` also point to the same place. `/usr/sbin` will be removed from the
    default `$PATH`. The same change is also done to make `/usr/local/sbin` point
    to `bin`, effectively making `/usr/local/bin/foo` and `/usr/local/sbin/foo` point
    to the same place. The definition of `%_sbindir` will be changed to `%_bindir`,
    so packages will start using the new directory after a rebuild without any further
    action. Maintainers *may* stop using `%_sbindir`, but don't need to.

- en: 'The split between `/bin` and `/sbin` is not useful, and also unused. The original
    split was to have "important" binaries statically linked in `/sbin` which could
    then be used for emergency and rescue operations. Obviously, we don''t do static
    linking anymore. Later, the split was repurposed to isolate "important" binaries
    that would only be used by the administrator. While this seems attractive in theory,
    in practice it''s very hard to categorize programs like this, and normal users
    routinely invoke programs from `/sbin`. Most programs that require root privileges
    for *certain* operations are also used when operating without privileges. And
    even when privileges are required, often those are acquired dynamically, e.g.
    using `polkit`. Since many years, the default `$PATH` set for users includes both
    directories. With the advent of systemd this has become more systematic: systemd
    sets `$PATH` with both directories for all users and services. So in general,
    all users and programs would find both sets of binaries.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One additional use of the `/bin`—`/sbin` split is `consolehelper`. In this approach,
    the user-facing program (`/bin/foo`) is a symlink to `/bin/consolehelper`, which
    is a suid binary that elevates privileges and calls the "real" `foo` (`/sbin/foo`
    or `/usr/libexec/foo`). Most uses of consolehelper have been moved to polkit ([https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsermodeMigration](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsermodeMigration)),
    but some users remain ([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=502765](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=502765)).
    Use of `/sbin` for the privileged program is incompatible with the proposed merge;
    those packages will need to be adjusted to move the binary that requires privileges
    under `/usr/lib` or `/usr/libexec` (see Scope below).

- en: Since generally all user sessions and services have both directories in `$PATH`,
    this split actually isn't *used* for anything. Its main effect is confusion when
    people need to use the absolute path and guess the directory wrong. Other distributions
    put some binaries in the other directory, so the absolute path is often not portable.
    Also, it is very easy for a user to end up with `/sbin` before `/bin` in `$PATH`,
    and for an administrator to end up with `/bin` before `/sbin` in `$PATH`, causing
    confusion. If this feature is dropped, the system became a little bit simpler,
    which is useful especially for new users, who are not aware of the history of
    the split.

- en: 'Many years ago we merged `/bin` and `/usr/bin` ([https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/UsrMove)).
    In some ways *that* split was similar: it had historical justification that went
    away more than a decade prior, it was impossible to cleanly categorize programs
    into the the categories so effectively both parts were needed for boot, and even
    though it was making the system more complicated for little gain, the split was
    being carried forward because it was easier to do so than to remove it ([http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge)).
    *This* split is much less visible, but it''s also making the system more complicated
    for no gain, and removing it is the natural follow-up.'
