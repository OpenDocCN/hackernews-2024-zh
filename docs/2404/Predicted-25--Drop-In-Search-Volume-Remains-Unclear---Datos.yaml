    traditional search may be too early to predict

- en: A report from Gartner on February 19th of this year, caused a bit of a stir
    in the digital marketing world. According to the press release associated with
    the report, they made the claim that search traffic volume would fall 25% by 2026,
    as AI chatbots and other virtual assistants gain in popularity.

- en: Obviously we were intrigued by the prediction, as likely many of you were as
    well. So we looked at the clickstream data surrounding traditional search vs.
    AI-assisted search, to see if there were any early indicators of this shift taking
    place.

- en: Looking at just the inbound traffic to Bing.com, Google.com, OpenAI.com and
    Yahoo.com from January 2023 through the end of that calendar year, we found no
    appreciable shifts in total search volume. For instance, Google.com starts the
    year representing 91.5% of the total traffic to these sites, and then ends the
    year down less than a single percentage point to 90.7%.

- en: Meanwhile OpenAI.com, an early darling of the consumer-facing AI race for search
    volume, starts 2023 with a small bump in its traffic volume percentage from February
    to April, rising to as high as 3.1%, then settling back into a consistent 1.1%
    to 1.4% of total volume.

    users who conducted one or more searches using an AI agent during a given month.

- en: The numbers show that OpenAI.com and Bing.com — both of whom widely promoted
    their AI search tools — experienced significant increases in unique user interest
    during 2023\. OpenAI.com captured a seven point bump to 17.9% of the total audience,
    while Bing.com had a nearly 6% lift to 15.1% of the search audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, as impressive as these increases in users investigating AI search may seem,
    Google.com continues to dominate the majority of search volume over all. There’s
    definitely a trend toward usage of AI-assisted search, but we find almost no indication
    that traditional search is on a path to a 25% decline.

    in and of itself is not a bad thing, if it isn’t followed with a consistent behavior
    change, we can’t really call it a trend.

- en: Take the above Bing.com numbers for instance. If we credit the inclusion of
    AI search tools on the platform as the cause of the unique user bump, it would
    seemingly serve to solidify the predicted 25% drop. Yet when we consulted our
    panel data further, we found that only between 4% and 9% of users used Bing Chat
    (their AI agent) in any given month during 2023\. What’s more, of those that did
    use it, only two to four searches were conducted over the ensuing month.

  prefs: []

- en: While all of the traditional search engines had repeated searches from each
    user over the course of a month, the AI chatbots all displayed initial enthusiasm,
    followed by a steep decline in usage.

- en: Using the next two charts to illustrate this point, we see the average Google.com
    user searched with the platform repeatedly over a 120 day period. This suggests
    a healthy segment of people are conducting a Google search almost daily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, the average visitor to OpenAI.com over the same period reveals
    a markedly different story. Here we see the typical user will investigate the
    tool, try it a few times and then seemingly loses interest as the search volume
    drops off a proverbial cliff.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While we wouldn’t go so far as to claim AI search is a fad — because it’s not
    — the data does hint at a potentially hidden bubble that needs to be investigated
    further. If anything, it may be indicating the technology would need significant
    improvement before it could seriously challenge Google’s dominance, and that 2026
    is not nearly enough time to achieve that.

    completed joint research study with SparkToro, entitled, [“Who Sends Traffic on
    the Web and How Much?” ](https://sparktoro.com/blog/who-sends-traffic-on-the-web-and-how-much-new-research-from-datos-sparktoro/)

    as you can see in the graph below, it does also provide a specific look at the
    top search providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What’s notable here is that in search we assume that referrals represent the
    single most important use of a platform. After all, there’s a reason the most
    popular search from the typical start page is “Google.” Users are looking to navigate
    to where they are going, rather than expecting immediate answers.
  prefs: []

- en: Google.com, Yahoo.com and Bing.com are effective at referring traffic, showing
    referral numbers that are commensurate with their overall volume of visits. However,
    OpenAI.com is clearly not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This further feeds the conventional wisdom that AI, while good at providing
    fast answers, is terrible at referring users to where they want to go. And as
    long as usage behavior demands a tool that gets people where they want to go as
    the primary function, AI will most likely not gain meaningful ground on traditional
    search.

- en: Well, even though it may seem counterintuitive to some, after conducting this
    research we still remain bullish on applications of AI for search. It holds great
    promise for marketers and we believe it will vastly improve search over time.
    However, we also caution against rushing into over-investment in the technology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our main suggestion is to begin with your customers’ needs. Using surveys, focus
    groups or otherwise engaging with them, uncover the types of search optimization
    that will most improve your relationship with the consumer. If you find AI offers
    the best means of doing that, pursue it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also recommend that you develop a two-tiered approach to optimization. Knowing
    that AI is good for immediate answers, while traditional search is better at routing,
    develop a plan that accommodates both choices to account for a greater swath of
    your audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you can assume that search engines are already deploying AI in their
    search solutions, and will continue to evolve these efforts to the point it may
    become difficult to distinguish between traditional and AI search. This means
    the smart play is to carefully consider whether to invest in a new platform or
    simply wait until the right solution comes to you.

    is not imminent — which is probably good news for most of us.
