- en: A report from Gartner on February 19th of this year, caused a bit of a stir
    in the digital marketing world. According to the press release associated with
    the report, they made the claim that search traffic volume would fall 25% by 2026,
    as AI chatbots and other virtual assistants gain in popularity.

- en: Obviously we were intrigued by the prediction, as likely many of you were as
    well. So we looked at the clickstream data surrounding traditional search vs.
    AI-assisted search, to see if there were any early indicators of this shift taking
    place.

- en: Looking at just the inbound traffic to Bing.com, Google.com, OpenAI.com and
    Yahoo.com from January 2023 through the end of that calendar year, we found no
    appreciable shifts in total search volume. For instance, Google.com starts the
    year representing 91.5% of the total traffic to these sites, and then ends the
    year down less than a single percentage point to 90.7%.

    volume, starts 2023 with a small bump in its traffic volume percentage from February
    to April, rising to as high as 3.1%, then settling back into a consistent 1.1%
    to 1.4% of total volume.

- en: The numbers show that OpenAI.com and Bing.com — both of whom widely promoted
    their AI search tools — experienced significant increases in unique user interest
    during 2023\. OpenAI.com captured a seven point bump to 17.9% of the total audience,
    while Bing.com had a nearly 6% lift to 15.1% of the search audience.

    Google.com continues to dominate the majority of search volume over all. There’s
    definitely a trend toward usage of AI-assisted search, but we find almost no indication
    that traditional search is on a path to a 25% decline.

- en: Take the above Bing.com numbers for instance. If we credit the inclusion of
    AI search tools on the platform as the cause of the unique user bump, it would
    seemingly serve to solidify the predicted 25% drop. Yet when we consulted our
    panel data further, we found that only between 4% and 9% of users used Bing Chat
    (their AI agent) in any given month during 2023\. What’s more, of those that did
    use it, only two to four searches were conducted over the ensuing month.

  zh: 拿 Bing.com 的数据举个例子。如果我们将平台上 AI 搜索工具的包含归因为独特用户增长的原因，那似乎会导致预测的 25% 下降成为现实。然而，当我们进一步咨询我们的面板数据时，我们发现，2023
    年每月只有 4% 到 9% 的用户使用了 Bing Chat（它们的 AI 代理）。更重要的是，那些使用它的用户中，随后一个月只进行了两到四次搜索。

- en: While we wouldn’t go so far as to claim AI search is a fad — because it’s not
    — the data does hint at a potentially hidden bubble that needs to be investigated
    further. If anything, it may be indicating the technology would need significant
    improvement before it could seriously challenge Google’s dominance, and that 2026
    is not nearly enough time to achieve that.

- en: What’s notable here is that in search we assume that referrals represent the
    single most important use of a platform. After all, there’s a reason the most
    popular search from the typical start page is “Google.” Users are looking to navigate
    to where they are going, rather than expecting immediate answers.

  zh: 这里值得注意的是，在搜索中，我们假设推荐代表了平台的最重要使用方式。毕竟，通常起始页最流行的搜索是“Google”，这是有原因的。用户希望导航到他们要去的地方，而不是期望立即得到答案。
- en: Google.com, Yahoo.com and Bing.com are effective at referring traffic, showing
    referral numbers that are commensurate with their overall volume of visits. However,
    OpenAI.com is clearly not.

  zh: Google.com、Yahoo.com 和 Bing.com 在引导流量方面效果显著，显示出与它们总访问量相符的推荐数字。然而，OpenAI.com

- en: This further feeds the conventional wisdom that AI, while good at providing
    fast answers, is terrible at referring users to where they want to go. And as
    long as usage behavior demands a tool that gets people where they want to go as
    the primary function, AI will most likely not gain meaningful ground on traditional
    search.

  zh: 这进一步证实了传统智能虽然能够快速提供答案，但在引导用户到他们想去的地方方面却表现糟糕。只要使用行为要求一个能够主要功能将人们引导到他们想去的地方的工具，AI

    develop a plan that accommodates both choices to account for a greater swath of

    search solutions, and will continue to evolve these efforts to the point it may
    become difficult to distinguish between traditional and AI search. This means

    simply wait until the right solution comes to you.
