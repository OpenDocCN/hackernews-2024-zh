- en: The European Union has opened a second formal investigation into TikTok, [announcing
    Monday](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2227) that
    it suspects the video sharing platform of breaking the bloc’s Digital Services
    Act (DSA), an online governance and content moderation framework.

- en: The Commission also said it’s minded to impose interim measures that could force
    the company to suspend access to the TikTok Lite app in the EU while it investigates
    concerns the app poses mental health risks to users. Although the EU has given
    TikTok until April 24 to argue against the measure — meaning the app remains accessible
    for now.

    second probe it’s opened on TikTok after announcing an (ongoing) investigation
    into multiple aspects of its DSA compliance [back in February](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/19/tiktok-dsa-probe/).
    Since [December](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/x-dsa-probe/) X has also been
    under investigation over a range of DSA compliance concerns.

- en: The EU’s first TikTok probe covers multiple issues including the protection
    of minors, advertising transparency, data access for researchers and the risk
    management of addictive design and harmful content. Hence it said the latest investigation
    will specifically focus on TikTok Lite, a version of the video sharing platform
    which launched earlier this month in France and Spain and includes a mechanism
    that allows users to earn points for doing things like watching or liking videos.

- en: Points earned through TikTok Lite can be exchanged for things like Amazon gift
    vouchers or TikTok’s own digital currency for gifting to creators. The Commission
    is worried this so-called “task and reward” feature could negatively impact the
    mental health of young users by “stimulating addictive behavior”.

    DSA obligation to conduct and submit a risk assessment report prior to the launch
    of the “Task and Reward Lite” program, with a particular focus on negative effects
    on mental health, including minors’ mental health. It also said it will look into
    measures taken by TikTok to mitigate those risks.

    announcing the action, the EU said ByteDance failed to produce a risk assessment
    about the feature which it had asked to see [last week](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/byedance-rfi-tiktok-lite/)
    — when it gave the company 24 hours to produce the document.

  zh: 在[一份新闻稿](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2227)中宣布行动时，欧盟表示，字节跳动未能提交关于所要求的功能的风险评估，而欧盟在[上周](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/byedance-rfi-tiktok-lite/)给予该公司
    24 小时的时间提交这份文件。
- en: TikTok is regulated under the strictest regime of the DSA, which applies to
    around half a dozen larger platforms. This extra layer of risk mitigation requirements
    obliges them to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks — such as addictive
    design that could harm users’ mental health.

- en: 'The EU’s suspicion is ByteDance failed to do this before going ahead and launching
    TikTok Lite in the two EU markets: Since it failed to submit the risk assessment
    paperwork on April 18 the Commission wrote that it suspects a “prima facie infringement
    of the DSA”.'

  zh: 欧盟怀疑字节跳动在在未在两个欧盟市场上推出 TikTok Lite 之前未完成此事项。 自从它未在 4 月 18 日提交风险评估文件以来，委员会写道，它怀疑存在“欧盟
    DSA 初步侵犯”。
- en: The regulation bakes in a regime of smaller fines for failures to produce requested
    information on time, as appears to have happened here. ByteDance could therefore
    face a penalty of up to 1% of its total annual income or worldwide turnover and
    periodic penalties up to 5% of average daily income or worldwide annual turnover
    specifically for this type of DSA compliance failure.

- en: 'Commenting on the Commission’s enforcement action in a statement, Thierry Breton,
    the commissioner for the EU Internal Market, wrote: “Endless streams of short
    and fast-paced videos could be seen as fun, but also expose our children to risks
    of addiction, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low attention spans… With
    our first DSA non-compliance case against TikTok still ongoing, the company has
    launched TikTok Lite which financially rewards extra screen time. We suspect TikTok
    ‘Lite’ could be as toxic and addictive as cigarettes ‘light’. Unless TikTok provides
    compelling proof of its safety, which it has failed to do until now, we stand
    ready to trigger DSA interim measures including the suspension of TikTok Lite
    feature which we suspect could generate addiction. We will spare no effort to
    protect our children.”'

    尽管我们对 TikTok 的第一个 DSA 不符合案件仍在进行中，但公司推出的 TikTok Lite 在财务上奖励额外的屏幕时间。 我们怀疑 TikTok
    ‘Lite’ 可能像香烟‘轻’一样有毒且成瘾。 除非 TikTok 提供了其安全性的有力证据，直到现在它未能做到，我们将准备触发 DSA 的临时措施，包括暂停我们怀疑可能引起成瘾的
    TikTok Lite 功能。 我们将不遗余力地保护我们的孩子。”
