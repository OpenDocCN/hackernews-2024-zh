- en: The European Union has opened a second formal investigation into TikTok, [announcing
    Monday](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2227) that
    it suspects the video sharing platform of breaking the bloc’s Digital Services
    Act (DSA), an online governance and content moderation framework.

- en: The Commission also said it’s minded to impose interim measures that could force
    the company to suspend access to the TikTok Lite app in the EU while it investigates
    concerns the app poses mental health risks to users. Although the EU has given
    TikTok until April 24 to argue against the measure — meaning the app remains accessible
    for now.

    where it can show a platform has not followed expected procedure.

- en: Penalties for confirmed violations of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual
    turnover. So ByteDance, TikTok’s parent, could face hefty fines if EU enforcers
    do end up deciding it has broken the law.

    second probe it’s opened on TikTok after announcing an (ongoing) investigation
    into multiple aspects of its DSA compliance [back in February](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/19/tiktok-dsa-probe/).
    Since [December](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/x-dsa-probe/) X has also been
    under investigation over a range of DSA compliance concerns.

- en: The EU’s first TikTok probe covers multiple issues including the protection
    of minors, advertising transparency, data access for researchers and the risk
    management of addictive design and harmful content. Hence it said the latest investigation
    will specifically focus on TikTok Lite, a version of the video sharing platform
    which launched earlier this month in France and Spain and includes a mechanism
    that allows users to earn points for doing things like watching or liking videos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Points earned through TikTok Lite can be exchanged for things like Amazon gift
    vouchers or TikTok’s own digital currency for gifting to creators. The Commission
    is worried this so-called “task and reward” feature could negatively impact the
    mental health of young users by “stimulating addictive behavior”.

- en: The EU wrote that the second probe will focus on TikTok’s compliance with the
    DSA obligation to conduct and submit a risk assessment report prior to the launch
    of the “Task and Reward Lite” program, with a particular focus on negative effects
    on mental health, including minors’ mental health. It also said it will look into
    measures taken by TikTok to mitigate those risks.

- en: In a [press release](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2227)
    announcing the action, the EU said ByteDance failed to produce a risk assessment
    about the feature which it had asked to see [last week](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/byedance-rfi-tiktok-lite/)
    — when it gave the company 24 hours to produce the document.

- en: TikTok is regulated under the strictest regime of the DSA, which applies to
    around half a dozen larger platforms. This extra layer of risk mitigation requirements
    obliges them to proactively identify and mitigate systemic risks — such as addictive
    design that could harm users’ mental health.
  prefs: []

- en: 'The EU’s suspicion is ByteDance failed to do this before going ahead and launching
    TikTok Lite in the two EU markets: Since it failed to submit the risk assessment
    paperwork on April 18 the Commission wrote that it suspects a “prima facie infringement
    of the DSA”.'

- en: The regulation bakes in a regime of smaller fines for failures to produce requested
    information on time, as appears to have happened here. ByteDance could therefore
    face a penalty of up to 1% of its total annual income or worldwide turnover and
    periodic penalties up to 5% of average daily income or worldwide annual turnover
    specifically for this type of DSA compliance failure.

    failing to produce the risk assessment document on time as yet.

    But as of press time it had not responded. **Update:** A TikTok spokesperson said:
    “We are disappointed with this decision — the TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available
    to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks. We will continue
    discussions with the Commission.”'

    suspected absence of effective age verification mechanisms on TikTok”, which is
    an area the Commission’s first TikTok investigation is looking into.

    the commissioner for the EU Internal Market, wrote: “Endless streams of short
    and fast-paced videos could be seen as fun, but also expose our children to risks
    of addiction, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, low attention spans… With
    our first DSA non-compliance case against TikTok still ongoing, the company has
    launched TikTok Lite which financially rewards extra screen time. We suspect TikTok
    ‘Lite’ could be as toxic and addictive as cigarettes ‘light’. Unless TikTok provides
    compelling proof of its safety, which it has failed to do until now, we stand
    ready to trigger DSA interim measures including the suspension of TikTok Lite
    feature which we suspect could generate addiction. We will spare no effort to
    protect our children.”'
