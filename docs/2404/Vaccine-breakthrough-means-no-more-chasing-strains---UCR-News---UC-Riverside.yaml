- en: Scientists at UC Riverside have demonstrated a new, RNA-based vaccine strategy
    that is effective against any strain of a virus and can be used safely even by
    babies or the immunocompromised.

    likely to be prevalent during the upcoming flu season. And every year, people
    line up to get their updated vaccine, hoping the researchers formulated the shot
    correctly.

    of the most prevalent strains circulating in the U.S.

- en: This new strategy would eliminate the need to create all these different shots,
    because it targets a part of the viral genome that is common to all strains of
    a virus. The vaccine, how it works, and a demonstration of its efficacy in mice
    is described in a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2321170121) published today
    in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

    said UCR virologist and paper author Rong Hai. “It is broadly applicable to any
    number of viruses, broadly effective against any variant of a virus, and safe
    for a broad spectrum of people. This could be the universal vaccine that we have
    been looking for.”

    virus. The body’s immune system recognizes a protein in the virus and mounts an
    immune response. This response produces T-cells that attack the virus and stop
    it from spreading. It also produces “memory” B-cells that train your immune system
    to protect you from future attacks.

    not rely on the vaccinated body having this traditional immune response or immune
    active proteins — which is the reason it can be used by babies whose immune systems
    are underdeveloped, or people suffering from a disease that overtaxes their immune
    system. Instead, this relies on small, silencing RNA molecules.

    RNAs as an immune response to viral infection. These RNAi then knock down the
    virus,” said Shouwei Ding, distinguished professor of microbiology at UCR, and
    lead paper author.

- en: The reason viruses successfully cause disease is because they produce proteins
    that block a host’s RNAi response. “If we make a mutant virus that cannot produce
    the protein to suppress our RNAi, we can weaken the virus. It can replicate to
    some level, but then loses the battle to the host RNAi response,” Ding said. “A
    virus weakened in this way can be used as a vaccine for boosting our RNAi immune
    system.”

    they did it with mutant mice lacking T and B cells. With one vaccine injection,
    they found the mice were protected from a lethal dose of the unmodified virus
    for at least 90 days. Note that some studies show nine mouse days are roughly
    equivalent to one human year.

    However, even newborn mice produce small RNAi molecules, which is why the vaccine
    protected them as well. UC Riverside has now been issued a US patent on this RNAi
    vaccine technology.

    also induce us to produce RNAi molecules. “That’s why our next step is to use
    this same concept to generate a flu vaccine, so infants can be protected. If we
    are successful, they’ll no longer have to depend on their mothers’ antibodies,”
    Ding said.

    people have an aversion to needles. “Respiratory infections move through the nose,
    so a spray might be an easier delivery system,” Hai said.

    to avoid this vaccination strategy. “Viruses may mutate in regions not targeted
    by traditional vaccines. However, we are targeting their whole genome with thousands
    of small RNAs. They cannot escape this,” Hai said.

    make a one-and-done vaccine for any number of viruses.

    have similar viral functions,” Ding said. “This should be applicable to these
    viruses in an easy transfer of knowledge.”
