    and even a [guide to internals](http://sbcl.org/sbcl-internals/) (... this is
    written towards people who already know a lot about how it works though). [This

    is to give a tour of the internals of SBCL (... as an example of how a Lisp system
    looks like from the inside) while not assuming a lot of implementation-specific
    knowledge on the reader's part. It's also an experiment in "learning in the public";
    at the point of starting to write this, I don't actually know a lot about how
    SBCL works either. We're going to figure this out together.

    the two parameters to "GENERIC-+", so what is happening is we take the two parameters,
    add them, we then fill EDI with a third parameter, and add that one, too. For
    reasons yet unknown to us, we shift that integer to the left by one bit, thus
    we have 66 instead of 33... but the value is clearly related to the constant we

    parameter 1, coming in a register as per the relevant calling convention, is a
    64-bit integer, we can treat it as such; if it's a pointer to a struct, different
    code gets generated. However, you could pass in *any type of object* to a Lisp
    function; how do we generate code that can decide which one is which and can handle
    both?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If speed is not a concern, we can just take the "everything is an object" approach.
    That is, all our parameters arriving in registers are assumed to be pointers to
    the Generic Object Type, which has a well-defined layout, stating somewhere what
    *actual* type the object has. The code we generate reads this value, and depending
    on the actual type, can perform different operations on different object types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But then... how about *numbers*? This is where *boxing* comes in: in order
    to treat the number 42 as an object, we need to put it into an object that says

    somewhere on the heap.'
  prefs: []

    we need a pointer dereference to just figure out what the actual value is... and
