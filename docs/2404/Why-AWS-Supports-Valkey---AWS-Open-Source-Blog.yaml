- en: Less than a week after Redis Inc. announced it was [removing the open source
    license](https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/)
    and pulling out of the Redis project, Redis contributors banded together to move
    the community to The Linux Foundation as the [Valkey project](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey).
    They did this almost immediately after the license change announcement went live,
    in response to community outcry on GitHub and on social media, asking to fork
    the project or join an existing fork.

    when their projects are relicensed. Open source developers and others invest significant
    time and resources in building the projects, as well as the products and services
    on top of them. They can’t just walk away.

    who helped make Redis and other open source technologies what they are today.
    When Redis was open source, the majority of commits may have come from Redis employees
    in recent years, but many other contributors added significant value to the project
    which should not be discounted — especially considering the degree to which Redis
    employees also decided which contributions to accept.

    community is now unbound and will continue to use and contribute to the project
    as they have always done, and with more freedom. They want the project to be well-supported,
    available on their favorite Linux distribution or cloud instance, and free to
    use as they see fit. Keeping the project under the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses)
    BSD 3-clause license, helps the community ensure distribution and uninhibited
    use for Valkey.

    companies that they can continue to participate in development without worry that
    the open source license will be revoked. The move also ensures that no single
    organization will have an outsized influence on the project. It is the foundation’s
    mission to provide an environment that supports the long-term health and viability
    of open source projects. Under an open governance model, the project will attract
    diverse contributors, innovate faster, and remain vibrant and more secure over
    the long term.

    in January as a vendor-neutral, community-led project. The project is undergoing
    rapid development on new features, attracting new contributors, and adoption is
    growing. We hope that the Valkey project follows a similar trajectory.

    grow the project, according to the road map that’s already established by the
    project community. With support from corporate backers such as AWS, Google, Oracle,
    Ericsson, Snap, and others, the project is well on its way to its next release.

    adding Valkey support to our ElastiCache and MemoryDB managed database services,
    which are built on open source Redis and are compatible with open source Redis
    versions 7.0 and earlier. Our engineers will also continue contributing to the
    open source Valkey project to help keep it secure, add new features, and innovate.
    In the meantime, the license change does not impact existing or new applications
    for ElastiCache and MemoryDB and no change is required from AWS customers.

- en: We have a large business interest in seeing the project succeed. We also have
    some experience bringing a community together to form a new project after their
    open source project’s license changed. When Elastic changed the Elasticsearch
    license in 2021, we took the steps necessary to ensure the project remained open
    and available for community contribution and use. The result was [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/),
    an Apache 2.0-licensed project that has built a diverse contributor base and is
    now also [taking steps toward open governance](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/opensearch-expands-leadership-beyond-aws/).

    involved and contributing upstream to the open source projects that we build on
    and that our customers depend on. We were there when the Redis community moved
    toward an open governance model four years ago, adding two new project maintainers,
    including Madelyn Olson, a principal engineer at AWS and a longtime contributor.

    Redis including more support for [fine-grained access controls](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/9974),
    [coordinated failovers](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/8315) to eliminate
    data loss and reduce downtime of planned failovers, and the initial work laying
    the [foundation for TLS](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/9530), a widely adopted
    security protocol designed to facilitate data privacy and security over the internet.
