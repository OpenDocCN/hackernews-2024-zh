    comes next—a fully electric Atlas robot designed for real-world applications.
    The next generation of the Atlas program builds on decades of research and furthers
    our commitment to delivering the most capable, useful mobile robots solving the
    toughest challenges in industry today: with Spot, with Stretch, and now with Atlas.'

    [humanoid robots](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas). Now the landscape in the
    robotics industry is very different. Our customers have seen success with Spot
    and Stretch and they are eager to tackle the next challenge with Atlas. Given
    our track record of successful commercialization, we are confident in our plan
    to not just create an impressive R&D project, but to deliver a valuable solution.

    team is building the next generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities,
    and it will serve as a perfect testing ground for new Atlas applications. In the
    months and years ahead, we’re excited to show what the world’s most dynamic humanoid
    robot can really do—in the lab, in the factory, and in our lives.

    our walls. Following the commercial deployment of both Spot and Stretch, we know
    how to deliver real value for customers. Similar to our Stretch rollout, we will
    be partnering with a small group of innovative customers, beginning with Hyundai,
    to test and iterate Atlas applications over the next few years. This is the first
    look at a real product, but it certainly isn’t the last.

    than any of our previous generations. For example, our last generation hydraulic
    Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular
    objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring
    several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation
    needs in customer environments.

    commercial solution. Scaled [autonomous mobile robot deployments](https://bostondynamics.com/webinars/how-to-deploy-mobile-robots-for-industrial-inspection/)
    are part of the broader digital transformation ecosystem, requiring IT infrastructure,
    employee buy-in, connectivity, workflows, safety standards, and operational processes
    for the robots and the data they generate and rely on. With over 1,500 deployments,
    Spot is already teaching hundreds of companies how to work alongside autonomous
    mobile robots. We believe that humanoids will be most effective if they are deployed
    with in-depth models of a facility and lots and lots of data about how it operates.
    You can start creating these types of digital twins with Spot today, using Spot,
    Stretch, and Boston Dynamics to facilitate this operational sea change for your
    organization.

    progress over the past couple of years has been in software. In addition to our
    decades of expertise in simulation and model predictive control, we have equipped
    our robots with new AI and machine learning tools, like [reinforcement learning](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/starting-on-the-right-foot-with-reinforcement-learning/)
    and computer vision to ensure they can operate and adapt efficiently to complex
    real-world situations.

    software, which provides a centralized platform to manage your entire robot fleet,
    site maps, and digital transformation data. Today it’s available for Spot, but
    Stretch and Atlas will also be integrated into this enterprise solution. With
    a robust team of ML experts shaping our products, we are prepared to bring impactful
    AI to market immediately—we’ve already started with Spot, and it will get even
    better and faster with Atlas.

    and R&D pushing the limits of whole-body mobility and bimanual manipulation. From
    PETMAN testing protective clothing to the recently retired HD Atlas performing
    parkour, we have spent over a decade moving the state of the art forward with
    humanoid robotics.

    that could balance and move dynamically—robots that could navigate unstructured,
    unknown, or antagonistic terrain with ease. The humanoid form factor is a useful
    design for robots working in a world designed for people.

    move, what tools it needs to succeed, and how it can help people accomplish more.
    We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous, and
    more agile. Atlas may resemble a human form factor, but we are equipping the robot
    to move in the most efficient way possible to complete a task, rather than being
    constrained by a human range of motion. Atlas will move in ways that exceed human
    capabilities. Combining decades of practical experience with first principles
    thinking, we are confident in our ability to deliver a robot uniquely capable
    of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks in real applications.

    and collaboration. Boston Dynamics has proven that we can deliver the full package
    with both industry-leading robotics and a complete ecosystem of software, services,
    and support to make robotics useful in the real world.
