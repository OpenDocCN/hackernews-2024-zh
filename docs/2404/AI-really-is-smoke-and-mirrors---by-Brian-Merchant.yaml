    so many shortcomings and uncertainties. (That, and the multibillion dollar support
    from the tech giants and capital flows from the VC sector.) It’s the driving force
    behind why investors and corporate clients are still buying in — why, financial
    services firm Klarna, for one, [says it has replaced](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/)

    And why a large percentage of Fortune 500 companies are reportedly using generative
    AI. As a recent Times headline put it: “[Will A.I. Boost Productivity? Companies

  zh: 尽管存在诸多缺陷和不确定性，正是这些故事推动生成式 AI 工业复杂体系不断前行（还有来自科技巨头的数十亿美元支持和风险投资部门的资本流动）。这正是为何投资者和企业客户仍在购买的推动力——比如金融服务公司
    Klarna，[称其已经替代了](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/)相当于

    500 强公司正在使用生成式 AI 的驱动力。正如《时代》最近的头条所言：“[人工智能能提高生产力吗？公司们非常希望能如此。](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/01/business/economy/artificial-intelligence-productivity.html)”
- en: 'All this is quite fortunate for Altman. And this is an element of the rise
    of AI that I don’t see discussed enough: His omnipotent AI is struggling to be
    born at an extremely convenient moment. There’s a tight labor market, high employment,
    and companies are very eager to embrace technological tools to either replace
    human workers or wield as leverage against them. Read through that Times piece,
    and you hear company after company hungry to slash labor costs with AI — if only
    they could! *That’s* the vision corporate America sees cast on the walls, the
    product of generative AI’s smoke and mirrors: Artificial systems that can save
    them lots of money by making workers disappear. Once it was the implied presence
    of the devil that underwrote the delusion that a charlatan could bring back the
    dead, today, it’s the specter of AGI that animates the idea that AI will finally
    unleash mass job automation.'

  zh: 这对 Altman 来说非常幸运，不仅因为 AI 的兴起 —— 我在讨论中看到不够充分了：他的全能 AI 正在非常便利的时刻面临出生的困境。此时劳动力市场紧张，就业率高，企业非常急切地想要采纳技术工具来替代人力资源或以此为谈判筹码。阅读纽约时报的这篇文章，你会听见一家接一家的公司在寻求通过
    AI 降低成本 —— 他们几乎就能够做到！这就是美国企业界眼中被包装的 AI 妙招：能够通过消失员工为企业节省大量成本的假人系统。曾经的诱惑是魔鬼隐秘的名声支撑着一个骗子能复活死人的幻想，而今天则是
    AGI 遥远的身影激发了 AI 终将大规模自动化就业的金刚怒目。
- en: Any threat to that show, however, is a threat to the generative AI enterprise
    at large. Last month, I wrote how [the tide was turning for OpenAI](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-tide-is-turning-against-openai): Between
    mounting legal woes and plateauing user growth, a disastrous *Wall Street Journal*
    interview and being booed at SXSW, the backlash, it seemed, had become at least
    as prominent as the mythos the world’s top AI company had worked so hard to generate
    for itself. And that’s a particularly pernicious problem for OpenAI and co; generative
    AI desperately needs that mythos. Once the narrative blows over, once the public,
    or at least the middle managers, get tired of waiting for real labor savings,
    aka more than analogical demonstrations of an incipient AGI — once the limits
    of the demonstration become too clear — the facade may begin to fall away from
    the entire phenomenon. In which case we’ll be left with text generators churning
    out reams of variously usable content, a pile of variously interesting chatbots,
    and automated JPEG producers that may or may not be infringing on copyright law
    thousands of times a day.

  zh: 然而任何对这项表演的威胁，都是对生成式 AI 领域的总体威胁。上个月，我写过如何 [对 OpenAI 的潮流造成转变](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-tide-is-turning-against-openai)：介于不断增加的法律问题和用户增长停滞，灾难性的《华尔街日报》采访以及
    SXSW 的嘘声，反对此事的关注似乎超过了世界顶级 AI 公司精心塑造的神话。而对于 OpenAI 和协同企业来说，这是尤其困扰的问题；生成式 AI 需要这个神话。一旦这种叙事消散，当公众，或者至少中层管理者对真正的劳动力成本节约（即初现的
    AGI 多多益善）感到厌倦 —— 当示范的局限性变得一目了然时 —— 这个现象的表象可能会开始瓦解。此时，我们将只剩下文本生成器输出多样可用内容，一堆各有兴趣的聊天机器人，以及可能侵犯版权法的每日成千上万次自动JPEG生产者。

    pull — companies desperately *do* want the promised service to work here, unlike,
    say, the metaverse or web3 or crypto, when most companies had no idea what they
    were really supposed to do with the vaporous trend at hand. And there is real
    tech behind those smoke and mirrors. Even [critics admit there are some good uses

    AI 行业的成本、伤害和激进的承诺。
- en: And so, with generative AI, we’re once again witnessing a core problem with
    entrusting technological development to a handful of self-mythologizing executives
    and founders in Silicon Valley. Instead of systems that are democratically and
    ethically constructed, built to serve humans and not just managers, whole constituencies
    and not just consultants; systems that could be very useful in some less-than
    earth-shattering ways, we get the smoke and mirrors. Again. And we can only hope
    that the magic lanterns of the 21st century haven’t cost us too much in the short
    term — in lost or damaged jobs, corrupted digital infrastructure, in the cheapening
    of culture — because by so [many counts](https://www.wheresyoured.at/peakai/),
    that smoke is already beginning to waft away.

    —— 在失去或破坏的工作岗位中，腐败的数字基础设施中，文化的廉价化中 —— 因为从很多角度来看，那些烟雾已经开始悄悄消散了。
