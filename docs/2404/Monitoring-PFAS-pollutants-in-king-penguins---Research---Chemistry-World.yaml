- en: New research shows how organohalogen pollutants affect different tissue types
    in king penguins. The work shows how various contaminants, including per- and
    polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organochlorine compounds, find their way
    into the seabirds’ fatty and protein-rich tissues.

    Because these compounds are difficult to break down, they persist in the environment
    and can bioaccumulate in food chains.

- en: Now, a team led by [Alice Carravieri](https://www.cebc.cnrs.fr/alice-carravieri/?lang=en)
    from the University of La Rochelle, France, has analysed the levels of organohalogens
    in blood samples taken from king penguins in the Crozet Islands in the southern
    Indian Ocean. Specifically, the team took samples from penguins that were fasting
    during their moulting and breeding periods. By monitoring changes in the concentrations
    of the contaminants, the researchers could gain insight into how the different
    compounds are mobilised while different tissues are metabolised.

- en: Over 25-day fasting periods, the researchers noted that the total concentration
    of pollutants in the penguins’ blood plasma doubled. This is because the contaminants
    are released into the bloodstream when fatty and protein-rich tissues in which
    they accumulate are burned for energy.

- en: Of the 36 compounds that the researchers searched for, 26 were detected in penguins’
    blood. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was by far the most prominent contaminant,
    accounting for 60% of the total pollutant concentration. While compounds like
    PFOS and hexachlorobenzene were shown to increase in the blood plasma of both
    breeding and moulting penguins, levels of perfluoroundecanoate and perfluorotridecanoate
    decreased in the blood of moulting penguins. The researchers suggest that a significant
    amount of these pollutants are incorporated into the penguins’ feathers.

- en: The researchers also note that the mobilisation of PFOS and long-chain perfluoroalkyl
    carboxylic acids is a cause for concern, as these compounds are highly toxic and
    can be transported to sensitive tissues including eggs and the brain. They say
    that further research is urgently needed to monitor the impacts of these compounds
    on the physiology and fitness of seabirds, particularly during prolonged periods
    of fasting.
