# Will this be our biggest ever river catch? | Updates | The Ocean Cleanup

> 来源：[https://theoceancleanup.com/updates/the-ocean-cleanup-makes-biggest-ever-river-catch-in-guatemala/](https://theoceancleanup.com/updates/the-ocean-cleanup-makes-biggest-ever-river-catch-in-guatemala/)

Interceptor 006 has had unprecedented impact in Guatemala – and is kicking off 2024 in encouraging style. We look forward to learning just how massive this trash flood was and continuing to optimize Interceptor 006 to catch much more during the year.

Our mission is to rid the oceans of plastic, and Interceptor 006 is bringing us closer to completing that mission. Stay tuned to @theoceancleanup and monitor our updates on [theoceancleanup.com](https://theoceancleanup.com/) to see our impact of our Interceptors in Guatemala and other rivers around the world.

*Interceptor 006 in the Rio Las Vacas, Guatemala, is deployed by The Ocean Cleanup in collaboration with partners Municipality of Guatemala City, Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, BiosferaGT, and Aliarse.*
