- en: I am a British citizen living in [Portugal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/portugal/).
    For some reason my old passport wasn’t being accepted at airport [e-gates](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/frictionless-travel-facial-recognition-airport-e-gates/)
    to enter the UK. I have renewed my passport but the problem persists when entering
    the UK.

- en: Immigration officers only ask where I’m travelling from as they put my passport
    in a scanner. When I ask why I have been rejected by the e-gates, I’m told either
    that they have different software to that being used by the e-gates, or that it’s
    because I have a common name.

    perhaps I should consider changing my name!

- en: If the reason is simply that you have a common name then surely there would
    be thousands of John Smiths and Peter Joneses with similar complaints. The ePassport
    gates work in part by using facial recognition technology to compare the faces
    of passengers to the images held on their biometric ePassports. Additional biographical
    and security checks are also conducted by Border Force officers using monitors
    behind the scenes. This explains why it sometimes takes longer to pass through
    the gates. You can also be rejected if you have grown facial hair, lost or gained
    a lot of weight or now wear glasses.

    individual cases for security reasons. I then asked David to put in a Freedom
    of Information request to see if we could find out more. This proved equally frustrating.
    The Border Force’s Information Rights Team simply said there are a number of “technical
    and security reasons” why David’s passport wasn’t accepted and it couldn’t be
    more specific as disclosure might prejudice law enforcement.

    and a hat, it shouldn’t be beyond the scope of the Border Force’s IT system to
    flag up that this David Clark is good to enter the UK having been checked manually
    on a previous visit.

    issues. One had been told, unofficially, that he shared a name with someone on
    a “watch list”.

- en: The Border Force’s IT system clearly isn’t fit for purpose. In February, David
    Neal, Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, published a withering
    report after a re-inspection of ePassport gates at three UK airports. He found
    the latest IT upgrade had resulted in “poor management of Home Office records”
    resulting in even more passengers being referred due to “inaccurate historical
    data not being cleansed from records”.
