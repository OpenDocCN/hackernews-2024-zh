    as two lifeforms have merged into one organism that boasts abilities its peers
    would envy. Last time this happened, Earth got plants.

- en: The phenomenon is called [primary endosymbiosis](https://newatlas.com/biology/synthetic-hybrids-yeast-bacteria-evolution-symbiosis/),
    and it occurs when one microbial organism engulfs another, and starts using it
    like an internal organ. In exchange, the host cell provides nutrients, energy,
    protection and other benefits to the symbiote, until eventually it can no longer
    survive on its own and essentially ends up *becoming* an organ for the host –
    or what’s known as an organelle in microbial cells.

    to manually filter their blood through a dialysis machine. Then one day some guy
    somehow gets one of these kidney critters stuck... Internally (who are we to judge
    how?) – and realizes he no longer needs his dialysis machine. Neither do his kids,
    until eventually we're all born with these helpful little fellas inside us. That’s
    kind of what’s happening here.

- en: In the 4-billion-odd-year history of life on Earth, primary endosymbiosis is
    thought to have only happened twice that we know of, and each time was a massive
    breakthrough for evolution. The first occurred about 2.2 billion years ago, when
    an archaea swallowed a bacterium that became the mitochondria. This specialized
    energy-producing organelle allowed for basically all complex forms of life to
    evolve. It remains the heralded "powerhouse of the cell" to this day.

    advanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria that could harvest energy from sunlight.
    These became organelles called chloroplasts, which gave sunlight-harvesting abilities,
    as well as a fetching green color, to a group of lifeforms you might have heard
    of – plants.

- en: And now, scientists have discovered that it’s happening again. A species of
    algae called *Braarudosphaera bigelowii* was found to have engulfed a cyanobacterium
    that lets them do something that algae, and plants in general, can’t normally
    do – "fixing" nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it with other elements
    to create more useful compounds.

- en: Nitrogen is a key nutrient, and normally plants and algae get theirs through
    symbiotic relationships with bacteria that remain separate. At first it was thought
    that *B. bigelowii* had hooked up this kind of situation with a bacterium called
    UCYN-A, but on closer inspection, scientists discovered that the two have gotten
    far more intimate.

- en: In one recent study, a team found that the size ratio between the algae and
    UCYN-A stays similar across different related species of the algae. Their growth
    appears to be controlled by the exchange of nutrients, leading to linked metabolisms.

    of the studies. “If you look at the mitochondria and the chloroplast, it’s the
    same thing: they scale with the cell.”'

- en: In a follow-up study, the team and other collaborators used a powerful X-ray
    imaging technique to view the interior of the living algae cells. This revealed
    that the replication and cell division was synchronized between the host and symbiote
    – more evidence of primary endosymbiosis at work.

    the algal cells. They found that the isolated bacterium can only produce about
    half of the proteins it needs, relying on the algal host to provide the rest.

- en: “That’s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an
    organelle,” said Zehr. “They start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their genomes
    get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell for those
    gene products – or the protein itself – to be transported into the cell.”

- en: Altogether, the team says this indicates UCYN-A is a full organelle, which is
    given the name of nitroplast. It appears that this began to evolve around 100
    million years ago, which sounds like an incredibly long time but is a blink of
    an eye compared to mitochondria and chloroplasts.

- en: The researchers plan to continue studying nitroplasts, to find out if they’re
    present in other cells and what effects they may have. One possible benefit is
    that it could give scientists a new avenue to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into
    plants to grow better crops.
