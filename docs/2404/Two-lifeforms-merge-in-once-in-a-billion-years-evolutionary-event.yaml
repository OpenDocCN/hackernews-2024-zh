    as two lifeforms have merged into one organism that boasts abilities its peers
    would envy. Last time this happened, Earth got plants.

- en: The phenomenon is called [primary endosymbiosis](https://newatlas.com/biology/synthetic-hybrids-yeast-bacteria-evolution-symbiosis/),
    and it occurs when one microbial organism engulfs another, and starts using it
    like an internal organ. In exchange, the host cell provides nutrients, energy,
    protection and other benefits to the symbiote, until eventually it can no longer
    survive on its own and essentially ends up *becoming* an organ for the host –
    or what’s known as an organelle in microbial cells.

    to manually filter their blood through a dialysis machine. Then one day some guy
    somehow gets one of these kidney critters stuck... Internally (who are we to judge
    how?) – and realizes he no longer needs his dialysis machine. Neither do his kids,
    until eventually we're all born with these helpful little fellas inside us. That’s
    kind of what’s happening here.

- en: In the 4-billion-odd-year history of life on Earth, primary endosymbiosis is
    thought to have only happened twice that we know of, and each time was a massive
    breakthrough for evolution. The first occurred about 2.2 billion years ago, when
    an archaea swallowed a bacterium that became the mitochondria. This specialized
    energy-producing organelle allowed for basically all complex forms of life to
    evolve. It remains the heralded "powerhouse of the cell" to this day.

- en: The second time happened about 1.6 billion years ago, when some of these more
    advanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria that could harvest energy from sunlight.
    These became organelles called chloroplasts, which gave sunlight-harvesting abilities,
    as well as a fetching green color, to a group of lifeforms you might have heard
    of – plants.

- en: And now, scientists have discovered that it’s happening again. A species of
    algae called *Braarudosphaera bigelowii* was found to have engulfed a cyanobacterium
    that lets them do something that algae, and plants in general, can’t normally
    do – "fixing" nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it with other elements
    to create more useful compounds.

- en: Nitrogen is a key nutrient, and normally plants and algae get theirs through
    symbiotic relationships with bacteria that remain separate. At first it was thought
    that *B. bigelowii* had hooked up this kind of situation with a bacterium called
    UCYN-A, but on closer inspection, scientists discovered that the two have gotten
    far more intimate.

  zh: 氮素是关键的营养物质，通常植物和藻类通过与保持独立的细菌的共生关系获取它们。起初人们认为*大型B. bigelowii*与名为UCYN-A的细菌建立了这种关系，但经过更仔细的检查，科学家们发现这两者之间的关系更为密切。
- en: In one recent study, a team found that the size ratio between the algae and
    UCYN-A stays similar across different related species of the algae. Their growth
    appears to be controlled by the exchange of nutrients, leading to linked metabolisms.

  zh: 在最近的一项研究中，一个团队发现了藻类与UCYN-A之间的大小比例在不同相关物种之间保持相似。它们的生长似乎受到养分交换的控制，导致了联合的新陈代谢。
- en: '“That’s exactly what happens with organelles,” said Jonathan Zehr, an author
    of the studies. “If you look at the mitochondria and the chloroplast, it’s the
    same thing: they scale with the cell.”'

- en: In a follow-up study, the team and other collaborators used a powerful X-ray
    imaging technique to view the interior of the living algae cells. This revealed
    that the replication and cell division was synchronized between the host and symbiote
    – more evidence of primary endosymbiosis at work.

- en: And finally, the team compared the proteins of isolated UCYN-A to those inside
    the algal cells. They found that the isolated bacterium can only produce about
    half of the proteins it needs, relying on the algal host to provide the rest.

  zh: 最后，团队比较了分离的UCYN-A细菌和藻类细胞内部的蛋白质。他们发现，分离的细菌只能产生大约它所需蛋白质的一半，依赖于藻类寄主提供其余部分。
- en: “That’s one of the hallmarks of something moving from an endosymbiont to an
    organelle,” said Zehr. “They start throwing away pieces of DNA, and their genomes
    get smaller and smaller, and they start depending on the mother cell for those
    gene products – or the protein itself – to be transported into the cell.”

  zh: “这是从内共生体向细胞器发展的典型特征之一，”泽尔说道。“它们开始丢弃DNA片段，基因组变得越来越小，并且开始依赖母细胞来运输这些基因产物或蛋白质本身进入细胞。”
- en: Altogether, the team says this indicates UCYN-A is a full organelle, which is
    given the name of nitroplast. It appears that this began to evolve around 100
    million years ago, which sounds like an incredibly long time but is a blink of
    an eye compared to mitochondria and chloroplasts.

  zh: 总体而言，团队表示这表明UCYN-A是一个完整的细胞器，被命名为硝酸盐体。它似乎大约在1亿年前开始进化，这听起来是一个非常长的时间，但与线粒体和叶绿体相比只是一瞬间。
- en: The researchers plan to continue studying nitroplasts, to find out if they’re
    present in other cells and what effects they may have. One possible benefit is
    that it could give scientists a new avenue to incorporate nitrogen-fixing into
    plants to grow better crops.
