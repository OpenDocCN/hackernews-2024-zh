    I dove into the fascinating details of a remote code execution backdoor planted
    in a compression library known as *liblzma*. The backdoor was probably the most
    sophisticated (and brazen!) attack on the open-source ecosystem in the annals
    of computer security.

    relationship between unpaid maintainers and the companies who benefit from their
    work. I found the argument unpersuasive:'

    there isn’t enough to do. They were written decades ago by a single person — and
    beyond bugfixes, they are not really supposed to change much. You don’t do major
    facelifts of zlib or giflib every year; even if you wave some cash around, it’s
    hard to build a sustainable community around watching paint dry. “*'

    — started calling on open-source maintainers to beef up project governance. Some
    of the proposals include mandatory two-person code reviews, self-assessments,
    SLAs, and written succession plans.

    — Github can! — but as the saying goes, you can’t out-Mossad the Mossad. This
    is not a defeatist stance: it’s just that we specialize for a reason. The maintainers
    of *libcolorpicker.so* can’t be the only thing that stands between your critical
    infrastructure and Russian or Chinese intelligence services. Spies are stopped
    by spies.'

    trillions of dollars riding on top of code developed by hobbyists. The companies
    profiting from this infrastructure can afford to thoroughly vet and monitor key
    dependencies on behalf of the community. To be clear, a comprehensive solution
    would be a difficult and costly undertaking — but it’s not any harder or costlier
    than large language models or self-driving cars.

    and ask them to do better next time. The answer is to address any counterintelligence
    lapses and to greatly improve behind-the-scenes detection capabilities.
