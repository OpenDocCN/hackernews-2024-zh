    the coolest and most environmentally friendly energy projects on Earth – the city’s
    deep lake water cooling system.

- en: Toronto’s Enwave Energy Corp., which owns and operates the giant deep lake water
    cooling (DLWC) system, already has some 40 kilometres of underground water pipes
    that snake through Toronto’s downtown and extend about five kilometres into Lake
    Ontario. The lake pipes channel water to and from a downtown heat transfer station
    at Pearl Street (west of University Avenue, between Adelaide Street West and King
    Street West).

- en: At a time when cities, government agencies and many private-sector firms are
    struggling to build or boost infrastructure projects, Enwave is now expanding
    the Pearl Street station as part of a $100-million program to increase the system’s
    reach to even more Toronto buildings. Enwave is co-owned by Ontario Teachers’
    Pension Plan and IFM Investors, a group of Australian pension funds.

    We’re increasing our capacity by 40 per cent,” says Carlyle Coutinho, Enwave’s
    president. The company received funding for the Pearl Street upgrade and additional
    clean-energy projects from the federal government’s Low Carbon Economy Fund and
    the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

    buildings covering more than 40 million square feet of downtown real estate, including
    venerable landmarks such as the Toronto-Dominion Centre, Brookfield Place, Scotiabank
    Arena, eight hospitals and, most recently, the Fairmont Royal York hotel.

    provide enough low-carbon heating to make it possible to have an additional 10
    million square feet of commercial towers in downtown Toronto net-zero heated,”
    Mr. Coutinho says. (That’s roughly the same size as 170 football fields.) Enwave
    is also adding [a fourth intake pipe](https://urbanland.uli.org/sustainability/torontos-deep-lake-water-cooling-system-harnessing-the-depths-of-district-energy-for-large-scale-decarbonization)

    depth of 85 metres, where the water temperature is 4 C. The water goes through
    Toronto’s Island filtration plant where it is treated for use as drinking water.

    the buildings and is looped through Pearl Street and additional Enwave facilities

    season and the needs of buildings, their occupants and the rest of the city, water
    in adjacent loops can either be warmed electrically for hot water and heat or
    left just warm enough to be returned to municipal drinking supplies.

    its reliance on electricity for pumping and running the giant heat exchangers
    could contribute to carbon emissions if the power is from coal- or gas-fired plants
    or pose other risks if the source is nuclear energy.

    set the goal of becoming, by 2050, net zero in carbon emissions that cause climate

    with more than three million square feet of retail, office and residential space,
    to install [a thermal storage facility](https://www.enwave.com/case-studies/groundbreaking-expansion-project-brings-water-to-the-well/)

    by the DLWC system, with the capacity to hold 7.6 million litres of water.

    than they first thought. “When we were looking at our energy retrofit, we discovered

    management, multiresidential and hotels at KingSett Capital, which owns the building.
