    made-up CPUs? Why not x86, ARM or RISC-V? - Academia Stack Exchange

- en: In defense of the instructors, such as tenured/tenure-track professors and visiting/adjunct
    professors, and teaching assistants (T.A.s), it takes a lot of work to create/update
    a set of presentation slides, lecture notes, laboratory/lab assignments, and course
    projects for courses on computer architecture, or even their requisite course
    on computer systems.

    (or lectures, if you like), lab sessions that they manage, and recitation/tutorial
    sessions that they lead/teach. Also, they have to create/update and grade assignments,
    course projects, and examinations.

- en: There is a need to find a working toolchain for the chosen instruction set architecture
    (I.S.A.) for the computer architecture course. Commercial/Proprietary toolchains,
    such as those commercial electronic design automation (EDA) software, require
    technical support by the teaching assistants/T.A.s. Open-source EDA software can
    alleviate the problem, but still need more industry buy-in. If a lot of hiring
    managers create job descriptions that include open-source EDA tools and recently
    created hardware description/construction languages (HDLs/HCLs), such as Chisel
    HDL, PyMTL, and PyRTL, a lot of T.A.s would support the use of such open-source
    EDA tools, HDLs, and HCLs.

- en: Using the x86-64, including Intel 64 (Intel's version of x86-64), as the I.S.A.
    to teach computer architecture is a nightmare. I.S.A.s based on Complex Instruction
    Set Computers (CISC) are much harder to teach than I.S.A.s based on Reduced Instruction
    Set Computers (RISC). Hence, using x86 I.S.A. to teach 32-bit processor architectures
    is no better.

    that make teaching annoying.

    been used in embedded systems, and MIPS I.S.A., which is not adopted in new products
    for embedded systems and other computer systems.

    to help people learn to use it in designing processors on its FPGA boards, and
    develop software in assembly language and compilers.

    projects online, which helps reflect the quality of their skill set while working
    on such projects. RISC-V International (previously RISC-V Foundation) had a Web
    page that shared university teaching resources for RISC-V and associated toolchains
    for simulating/emulating RISC-V processors, and assembling/compiling computer
    programs in assembly languages. It also contains benchmark programs for validating
    implementations of RISC-V processors in Register-Transfer Level (RTL).

    with a new I.S.A., toolchain or EDA tools, and update course materials for the
    new I.S.A.. This can be resolved if they are rewarded with grants by their academic
    departments to do so. If you want to speed up the process, you, some rich people
    who you are connected to, or crowdfunded sources can donate money to your academic
    department to speed up the process.
