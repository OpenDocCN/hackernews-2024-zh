- en: This month, [Japan](https://www.irishtimes.com/tags/japan/) launched its upgraded
    warship, the Kaga, from the port city of Kure in Hiroshima prefecture. The [repurposed
    vessel](https://www.newsweek.com/japan-js-kaga-helicopter-destroyer-aircraft-carrier-upgrade-china-us-alliance-1888740)
    is now a de facto aircraft carrier, capable of hosting up to a dozen American-built
    F-35 fighter jets.

    Japanese Navy fleet](https://www.historynet.com/kaga-aircraft-carrier/) that attacked
    Pearl Harbor in 1941, drawing the United States into the second World War. The
    conflict in the Pacific theatre climaxed with the destruction of Hiroshima and
    Nagasaki four years later.

    the sinking of the Amagi warship in a US air raid in 1945*.* Kaga’s sister ship,
    the Izumo, is also being upgraded to become the first Japanese naval vessel to
    operate fixed-wing aircraft since the war.

    and Democracy” and was “proud to be your shipmate”.
