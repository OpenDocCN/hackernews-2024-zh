# ‎The Official MTA App on the App Store

> This app is very useful, and is better then some apps I have for public transit. It shows all delays and there causes, status of every line, and shows me every stop near me, with an option to chose between Subway, bus or rail, or you could even see all three. In my opinion, this is all you would need for a quick way to start your day, or go somewhere. I wasn’t able to find route options. For example if I wanted to go somewhere I dident know, I would have to go on a third party app which is not included in the app. Honestly without that part, this app has everything you need and is a great choice.
