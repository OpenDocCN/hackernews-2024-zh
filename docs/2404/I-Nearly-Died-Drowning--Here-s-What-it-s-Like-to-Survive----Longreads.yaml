    and competence. When the risk is low and the skills are high, the person is toward
    the bottom of the chart in the “realm of exploration and experimentation.” When
    competence and risk are balanced, the participant is in the middle, and when risk
    exceeds competence, the outcome can be catastrophic. The more experience someone
    has with navigating risky situations, the more confident they become, skewing
    the variables. My boating experience was minimal and that section of river was
    not for beginners, but I had scraped by enough times that my risk assessment was

- en: I knew my reduced risk inhibition came from too many narrow escapes, and having
    a more experienced partner had created an “expert halo” that tipped the adventure-experience
    scale to a dangerous imbalance. At the same time, I hadn’t been looking to push
    my limits like the sensation-seeking personalities I kept reading about, people
    who needed big thrills to feel things. Those people often have lower trait anxiety,
    which means they feel less anxious in day-to-day life. While I loved being outside

    *enjoy* the feeling of fear. I’d just learned to ignore it.
