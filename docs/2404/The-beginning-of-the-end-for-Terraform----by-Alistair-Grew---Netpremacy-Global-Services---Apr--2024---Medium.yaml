- en: As I write this on the 25th of April, I am still reeling from the announcement
    of [IBM’s acquisition of Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-joins-ibm).
    When I first heard the rumours yesterday, I was concerned about the future of
    possibly my favourite Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. It has long been obvious
    that Hashicorp has been struggling to make money, making a [$274 million loss
    in 2023](https://ir.hashicorp.com/static-files/1d62b124-e329-4694-844d-aa6e028f2f92).
    This undoubtedly led to the highly controversial [switch to the BSL license in
    August 2023](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license)
    and the community fork of [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/). Hashicorp is hardly
    alone in its struggles, with [Redis adopting a similar approach](https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/),
    resulting in the [Valkey fork](https://valkey.io/) or [Elasticsearch with its
    license changes](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-license-update).

    modified under permissive licenses and the like, but fundamentally, developers
    are spending time writing code, and time typically requires some payment.

    in their ***spare*** time, but large open-source projects are typically supported
    by big tech firms contributing engineers or money to enable developers to work
    part or full-time on them; for example, look at the companies who pay to be members
    of the [Linux foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/members). As another
    example, Google is still the largest single contributor to the Kubernetes project.
    Google can do this because it makes money running services that rely on it, and
    sells a managed offering in [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en).

    public and private cloud environments but had little reason to pay for the Terraform
    Cloud product even if it had some advantages.

    have personally worked with [Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)
    & [Packer](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/packer) and seen plenty of [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)
    implementations. A lot of companies liked Hashicorp tooling because it was inherently
    cloud-agnostic; for multi-cloud organisations, having a common configuration language
    in Terraform or a secret management solution in Vault was preferable to learning
    each in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or the multitude of other providers.

    a cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) offering, [admittedly with a 1.8% market share](https://kinsta.com/blog/cloud-market-share/).
    Why would they want to keep developing tools that frankly benefit their competitors
    more than them?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My second concern, perhaps my biggest, is that IBM has a graveyard of failed
    acquisitions of good software companies. In recent history, their acquisition
    of Red Hat resulted in changes to CentOS that destroyed the market share of this
    once-popular distribution, anecdotally often in favour of Ubuntu LTS. This is
    far from the only example with [Lotus Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Software)
    being another from the 2000s. I simply have no trust in IBM to look after Hashicorp
    as a company.

    there is a fork in the road. Either we continue to stick with Terraform, as IBM
    no doubt attempts some renewed monetisation effort to make good on their investment,
    or we change our IaC tool. With the latter, what are our alternatives?

    approach in the context of Google’s Config Connector, showing some merit. Crossplane
    uses a similar ‘provider-centric’ approach like Terraform allowing easier extensibility
    to different platforms. Whilst the project is CNCF-backed (and going through adoption
    at the time of writing) the main contributor appears to be [Upbound](https://www.upbound.io/)
    whose financial sustainability I am equally unsure of.'

    Part of the appeal of Terraform was its consistency in configuration language,
    with providers abstracting the vendor-specific API calls.'

- en: I believe an ‘Open Terraform’ supported in development by those who profit from
    it is the answer. This is sort of what’s happened with OpenTofu, which has backers
    such as [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/). I would love to see an expansion of
    this support base to include all the major hyperscalers, who, in practice, are
    the ones making the most money from Terraform. Many of these hyperscalers are
    already deeply involved in developing providers that interface Terraform with
    their platform. Expanding this toward the tool itself doesn’t seem like a big
    leap; if they decide to do this, though, is anyone’s guess, especially with the
    news so fresh, we will have to wait and see…
