- en: '*File over app* is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that
    last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve
    and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.'

    you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

    thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the
    type of chisel that was used to carve them.

    mediums, from clay tablets to manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, and tapestries.
    These artifacts are objects that you can touch, hold, own, store, preserve, and
    look at. To read something written on paper all you need is eyeballs.

- en: Today, we are creating innumerable digital artifacts, but most of these artifacts
    are out of our control. They are stored on servers, in databases, gated behind
    an internet connection, and login to a cloud service. Even the files on your hard
    drive use proprietary formats that make them incompatible with older systems and
    other tools.

    2160s, it’s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.

    but also for your future self. You never know when you might want to go back to
    something you created years or decades ago. Don’t lock your data into a format
    you can’t retrieve.

- en: These days I write using an app I help make called [Obsidian](/obsidian), but
    it’s a delusion to think it will last forever. The app will eventually become
    obsolete. It’s the plain text files I create that are designed to last. Who knows
    if anyone will want to read them besides me, but *future me* is enough of an audience
    to make it worthwhile.</content>
