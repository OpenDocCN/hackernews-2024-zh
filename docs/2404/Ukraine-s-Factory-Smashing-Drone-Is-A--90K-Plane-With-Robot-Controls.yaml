    targeting Russia’s strategic industries, the Ukrainian government took a locally-made
    ultralight sport plane, swapped its manned controls for robotic controls and packed
    it with explosives.

    attack on the Alabuga Special Economic Zone industrial campus, 600 miles from
    the Ukrainian border, reveals that the drone—possibly two of which struck the
    campus—is based on an Aeroprakt A-22\. A high-wing, single-propeller sport plane
    with room for two.'

    the strike on the Alabuga facility, which reportedly assembles Iranian-designed
    Shahed drones for Russia’s own war effort, won’t be the last for this new drone
    type.

    And equally importantly, it’s made in Ukraine—and it’s affordable at just $90,000
    a copy.

    miles through Russian air defenses to deliver—with high accuracy—potentially hundreds
    of pounds of explosives, costs just slightly more than a single American-made
    Javelin anti-tank missile costs. Ukrainian troops fire Javelins by the hundred.'

    attacks will be attempted in the future,” the Ukrainian Conflict Intelligence
    Team [stated](https://notes.citeam.org/dispatch-apr-1-3-2024 "https://notes.citeam.org/dispatch-apr-1-3-2024")
    after analyzing the Alabuga raid, which reportedly injured 14 people and damaged
    either the drone factory or a nearby dormitory for workers.

    over the local airport. “If you're looking for a rugged aircraft that's easy to
    handle, has amazing short field performance, yet is capable of cruising at 95-plus
    knots, while (legally) carrying a good load—you've come to the right place!” Arizona-based
    Leighnor Aircraft, which deals the A-22 in the United States, [boasted on its
    website](https://www.leighnoraircraft.com/a22ls/ "https://www.leighnoraircraft.com/a22ls/").

    safety,” Leighnor stressed. “Stalling is a non-event, even without flaps. ...
    At slow speeds, the controls are light and effective—[and] at higher speeds they
    firm-up and make cruising a more relaxed affair.”

    drone, but it’s not hard to guess. Remember that, in 2019, the U.S. Air Force
    stripped the seats and controls out of a 1968-vintage Cessna 206 light plane and
    installed, in their place, a set of computer-driven servos.

    throttle, flips the appropriate switches and reads the dashboard gauges the same
    way a pilot does,” the Air Force Research Laboratories [explained](https://www.wpafb.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1935442/air-force-research-laboratory-successfully-conducts-first-flight-of-robopilot-u/

    “At the same time, the system uses sensors, like GPS and an inertial measurement
    unit, for situational awareness and information-gathering. A computer analyzes
    these details to make decisions on how to best control the flight.”

    able to rapidly and affordably convert a general aviation aircraft, like a Cessna
    or Piper, into an unmanned aerial vehicle, having it fly a mission autonomously,
    and then returning it back to its original manned configuration,” said Alok Das,
    an AFRL scientist. “All of this is achieved without making permanent modifications
    to the aircraft.”

    the autonomous controls. The drone is, in effect, a slow cruise missile. It’s
    not supposed to return to base.

    new controls and the explosive payload, an A-22 drone might cost a few hundred
    thousand dollars.

    around $500,000\. And it’s *much* cheaper than the $3-million Storm Shadow cruise
    missiles Ukraine has received from the United Kingdom.

    and the Storm Shadow, both of which travel no farther than 200 miles.

    126 miles per hour, compared to the 600 miles per hour a Storm Shadow can sustain.'

    makes an A-22-based drone vulnerable to Russian air defenses. In practice, air
    defenses are spread thin across the vastness of Russia’s interior. There’s plenty
    of room for Ukraine’s new cheapo sport-plane drones to roam—and strike.</fbs-ad></fbs-ad></fbs-ad>
