    by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice
    and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if
    agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months
    in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which
    the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.

    but before I could say something, looked at me and simply asked, “That is your
    test, correct?”

  zh: 那位医生向椅子上靠了靠，看出我想让他冷静下来，但在我说话之前，看着我，简单地问道：“这是你的测试，对吗？”

    in an account ready to be deposited into your company the moment we agree. Our
    terms are certainly within the range of your thinking are they not?

  zh: 奥斯瓦尔德简直不敢相信。他举起文件。“我在一个账户里有一百万美元，一旦我们达成协议就可以转入你的公司。我们的条件肯定在你考虑范围之内，对吧？”
- en: The doctor was already packing his briefcase. “Yes, they are. Not where we want
    them, but close enough.” Then he looked hard at Oswald. “But you are not, Mr.
    Oswald. In two ways. Counsel had one test to see if you wished power rather than
    cooperation and you failed that. But I had my own test. Would you equivocate why?
    I perhaps could work with a man of power interested in power if he was honest
    with me and we set the rules up clearly. But a man of power who does not tell
    me his true motivations? That is too much.”

  zh: 那位医生已经在收拾他的公文包了。“是的，他们是。虽然不是我们想要的位置，但足够接近。”然后他严厉地看着奥斯瓦尔德。“但你不是，奥斯瓦尔德先生。从两个方面来说。律师有一个测试，看看你是否希望权力而不是合作，而你失败了。但我有我的测试。你会模棱两可，为什么？也许我可以与一个真诚告诉我真实动机并且我们清楚设立规则的有权力的人合作。但是一个有权力却不告诉我他真正动机的人？那就太过分了。”

- en: Was he? Well, Oswald crushed the next two inventors he worked with…tossing them
    some money after he had pushed them out the door of their own companies. The doctor…well,
    he’s in Tuscany, though it took him an extra two years to raise the money. Two
    years in which his competitors almost beat him out.

  zh: 他是吗？嗯，奥斯瓦尔德打败了他接下来与的两位发明家…在把他们推出自己公司的大门之后，扔给他们一些钱。那位医生…嗯，他在托斯卡纳，尽管他花了额外的两年筹集资金。在这两年里，他的竞争对手几乎赶超了他。
- en: And during that time I often asked him if he had second thoughts. He did not.
    “I may fail, but I will fail because my product or my business thinking is not
    good enough. I will not fail because my own backer stabs me in the back. I have
    no regrets.”

  zh: 在那段时间里，我经常问他是否有后悔之情。他没有。“我可能会失败，但失败不会因为我的产品或商业思维不够好。我不会因为我的支持者在背后捅我一刀而失败。我没有遗憾。”
