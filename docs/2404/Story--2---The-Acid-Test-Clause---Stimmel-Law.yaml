    by an elderly attorney I worked with for the first fifteen years of my practice
    and I always nodded in his general direction when he said that and smiled as if
    agreeing. I liked and respected him, he had won more cases than there were months
    in my life at the time and he had lived in a legal and business world in which
    the entire community knew one another and knew who to trust.
