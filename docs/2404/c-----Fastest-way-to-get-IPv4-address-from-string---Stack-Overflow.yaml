    using a vectorized solution.

    than the code by OP. It processes **336 millions of addresses per second** (single
    core of 3.4 Ghz).

    you can see contents of the value just computed. All the arrays are printed in
    little-endian order (though `set` intrinsics use big-endian).

- en: First of all, we load 16 bytes from unaligned address by `lddqu` instruction.
    Note that in 64-bit mode memory is allocated by 16-byte chunks, so this works
    well automatically. On 32-bit it may theoretically cause issues with out of range
    access. Though I do not believe that it really can. The subsequent code would
    work properly regardless of the values in the after-the-end bytes. Anyway, you'd
    better ensure that each IP address takes at least 16 bytes of storage.

- en: Then we subtract '0' from all the chars. After that '.' turns into -2, and zero
    turns into -48, all the digits remain nonnegative. Now we take bitmask of signs
    of all the bytes with `_mm_movemask_epi8`.

- en: 'Depending on the value of this mask, we fetch a nontrivial 16-byte shuffling
    mask from lookup table `shuffleTable`. The table is quite large: 1Mb total. And
    it takes quite some time to precompute. However, it does not take precious space
    in CPU cache, because only 81 elements from this table are really used. That is
    because each part of IP address can be either one, two, three digits long => hence
    81 variants in total. Note that random trashy bytes after the end of the string
    may in principle cause increased memory footprint in the lookup table.'

    which uses lookup table of only 4Kb size (it is a bit slower, though).'

- en: The ingenious `_mm_shuffle_epi8` intrinsic allows us to reorder the bytes with
    our shuffle mask. As a result XMM register contains four 4-byte blocks, each block
    contains digits in little-endian order. We convert each block into a 16-bit number
    by `_mm_maddubs_epi16` followed by `_mm_hadd_epi16`. Then we reorder bytes of
    the register, so that the whole IP address occupies the lower 4 bytes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we extract the lower 4 bytes from the XMM register to GP register.
    It is done with SSE4.1 intrinsic (`_mm_extract_epi32`). If you don't have it,
    replace it with other line using `_mm_extract_epi16`, but it will run a bit slower.
