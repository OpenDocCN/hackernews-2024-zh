    This project took nine months to execute and includes prices from 46 U.S. states.

    exploring the exploitative and inconsistent pricing systems of prison commissaries,
    including maps and visualizations that illustrate how prices differ across the
    country. It also highlighted extreme examples of markups and costs compared to
    community prices.

- en: Beginning in July 2023, The Appeal requested copies of prison commissary price
    lists and vendor contracts from all state prison systems. In total, 46 state prison
    systems provided The Appeal with commissary lists. These records do not necessarily
    include commissary prices for privately operated prisons in these states.

- en: These requests produced more than 10,000 pages of records, including the commissary
    lists published in the database. Many prisons regularly update commissary inventories
    and prices, so the prices and products in the database may not be identical to
    those currently offered in a facility.

- en: The inconsistency of commissary offerings makes it difficult to compare specific
    products across states. Each state may choose to carry a different size or brand
    of toothpaste, for example, which could affect the price. Additionally, some states
    do not have a centralized commissary list, meaning each prison within the state
    may offer different prices for products.

    categories—food, personal care/hygiene, and religious items—and chose comparable
    items that were available in many different prisons.

    two key analyses.
  id: totrans-split-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For each product (e.g toothpaste) we first chose the lowest price offered at
    any commissary in each state, even if it wasn’t available at all facilities in
    the state. We did not include prices for incarcerated people [considered indigent](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/11/18/indigence/)
    because each state has different criteria and policies related to indigency.

- en: However, the cheapest option isn’t always the best. Many states sell single
    servings of goods like toothpaste or deodorant at lower prices, but they often
    cost more in the long run than larger packages. Additionally, prices are often
    low precisely because they are less desirable versions of a product than more
    expensive brand-name alternatives.
  id: totrans-split-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address this, The Appeal compared a widely available brand of each product
    (e.g. Colgate toothpaste instead of “toothpaste red gel”) in order to contextualize
    how prices for incarcerated people compare to what readers might pay in the community.

    with the lowest price, as well as a brand-name offering, like Ivory or Dove.

- en: This process was difficult even for popular items like ramen. Prices often differed
    depending on the flavor, the individual prison unit, or the facility. Not all
    states sell the same brand of ramen and some don’t specify what brand they sell.
    Ultimately, The Appeal chose to compare the lowest price for a single packet of
    ramen and to specify the brand and flavor when known.
