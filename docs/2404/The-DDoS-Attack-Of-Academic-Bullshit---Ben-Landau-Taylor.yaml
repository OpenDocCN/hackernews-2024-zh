    research material, I realized that he had never experienced internet search back
    when it was good. I tried to explain how it used to be easier to find information
    from good-faith experts, but I don’t think I really got the point across. Let
    me try again.

    of what you find will be [Out To Get You](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/out-to-get-you).
    It’s content marketing cobbled together by chatbots, or by people who might as
    well be chatbots. It’s algorithmically optimized to squat in the top search results
    as part of someone’s marketing funnel. It’s propaganda by NGO hacks, or recent
    news articles on a different topic that shares a keyword, or literal paid advertisements,
    or something. Maybe it has a little bit of information about what you actually
    wanted, and maybe it’s a trailhead towards a deep and serious source, but you
    don’t expect to just… find what you’re looking for, presented straightforwardly.

- en: My younger readers may not believe me, but internet search wasn’t always like
    this. Back in 1999, few people had figured out how to take advantage of search
    engines that way. When you looked for information about how to tell if your bread
    is rising correctly, or about South Korean cement manufacturing, or the musical
    influences on Igor Stravinsky, or whatever weird thing, Google would pull up high-quality
    reference material, or blogs and BBS arguments among disagreeable weirdos who
    specialized in the subject and usually knew what they were talking about. The
    tricky part wasn’t sifting through a mound of spam and paywalls and halfassed
    summaries to find something legitimate; the challenge was making sense of a high-context
    insider discussion on a topic you were trying to wrap your head around.

    some search term and churning out low-cost copy on the subject in order to serve
    ads to people trying to find real information. Specialists in “search engine optimization”
    popularized their techniques as consultants to big companies, and before long
    this became standard practice. In their efforts to keep these problems from getting
    totally out of hand, Google and other search engines weighted search results towards
    a whitelist of standard lowest-common-denominator websites. The long tail of the
    internet could no longer be found from a simple search.

    writing about their special interests, of course, but it’s much harder to find.
    You have to trace back sources and citations, or sift through the Twitter feed
    of a relatively knowledgeable author who mostly likes to yell about elections,
    or dig up the Youtube video with 86 views by a Turkish grandfather who just shows
    you how to replace the damn part, or you need to know a guy whose roommate is
    part of the right group chat. Maybe it’s out there, but you can’t just find it
    with a search.

    are gone when the people who are really interested in South Korean cement manufacturing
    could just Google the mailing list and start talking with each other. Instead
    they’re wandering through a desert of paid industry reports and Bloomberg articles.
    Productive discourse has retreated to walled gardens, and as a consequence there
    is much less of it.

    an academic publication, you can’t just assume it’s probably in good faith. You
    have to start from the assumption that it’s Out To Get You, because nine times
    out of ten, it is. Maybe it’s activist bullshit based around tendentiously redefining
    words, or maybe it’s built on fabricated medical data, or maybe it’s some kind
    of statistical jiggery-pokery to pull statistical significance out of unreplicable
    noise, or maybe it’s just a watered-down summary of better work, or maybe the
    author stapled together plagiarized excerpts of other papers which she didn’t
    understand—sorry, the author merely omitted quotation marks and citations. Or
    maybe it’s one of a hundred other things.

    from before 1990 or so, but it wasn’t always this way. Sure, it was never perfect,
    and you always have to read everything with skepticism. But the average quality
    was much better. Other people have written more deeply than I ever will about
    the forces that make today’s academic work so shoddy, about p-hacking and publish-or-perish
    and ideological fads and all that. What I know for sure is that when I read academic
    work published in 2014, I’m pretty likely roll my eyes and mutter about how no
    serious person would even bother with this crap and set it aside, whereas when
    I read something from 1964 then it’s much more likely to be, at the very least,
    a good-faith effort by a reasonably bright person saying something they care about.

    I find that almost everything that’s actually worth reading was written between
    about 1940 and 1990\. Before that, there wasn’t much English-language research
    that was based on a deep understanding of Chinese records. After that… I dunno,
    man. The recent stuff I’ve found is mostly shallow crap churned out to pad publication
    counts. The best recent work is summaries and retreads of older giants like Mark
    Elvin and Chi Ch'ao-ting and Joseph Needham—and these retreads contain real knowledge,
    but it adds very little to what came before, which is kind of embarrassing considering
    much of the midcentury stuff is absolutely terrible at big-picture theorizing
    even when their local scholarship is extremely good. (This is only partly because
    many of that generation of China scholars were Maoists.)

    is writing excellent work about Song dynasty merchant families which I would dearly
    love to read, but I haven’t been able to find it among the sea of bullshit and
    retreads. I’m mostly sticking to older work while I wait for the robots to get
    good enough at translation that I can read Chinese-language scholarship and primary
    sources.

    times faster than it did during the time of Albert Einstein and Neils Bohr. We
    do not have *thirty times* more Einsteins and Bohrs per capita. A doctorate just
    means much less, now, than it did. The fraction of physicists who can generate
    genuine new knowledge and insight is fairly small. Most of today’s physicists
    would not measure up to the standards that the field held for itself when that
    photo was taken in 1927\. To their credit, physicists have maintained intellectual
    and educational standards better than perhaps any other academic field. Medicine
    is in notably worse shape, for example. And outside of the hard sciences, well.
    It isn’t good.

    me and the New York Times to tell the first-rate researchers apart from the sea
    of mediocrities. It’s also harder for those on the cutting edge to find each other.
    The real ones can tell, when they look deeply at each other’s work, but that takes
    a ton of time and effort, so it’s not always practical. When an important new
    theory is published, instead of being circulated and torn apart by the two dozen
    people whose opinions matter, it’s sent off to some nameless apparatchik for the
    hollow bureaucratic ritual of peer review, so that the reviewer can demand bogus
    citations for himself and his friends. Every field has some real scientists doing
    excellent work. But twenty-nine thirtieths of their peers are cargo cultists,
    outright fraudsters, or at best just aren’t all that great at their jobs. Much
    has been made of “impostor syndrome” in academic research. The fundamental cause
    is that there aren’t enough non-impostors to fill all the positions.

    is when an attacker shuts down an internet server by sending a massive flood of
    bogus communication requests, overloading the machine’s bandwidth until it is
    unable to respond to legitimate requests. Academia’s minority of serious researchers
    are also flooded with a massive, hostile flood of bogus communication requests.
    If most of their ostensible peers can’t discover new knowledge, then how will
    they find peers to work with? If most publications aren’t worth the time it takes
    to read, then who will bother to read the minority that are actually good?

    do not raise their standards—and it seems like the opposite is more likely—then
    over time the real work will move gradually, and then suddenly, into different
    channels that are able to filter out the noise. This process is already underway.
    Because the internet commentariat’s intellectual elite is more attentive to an
    argument’s substance than whether it observes the bureaucratic forms, these circles
    are much less vulnerable to getting DDoSed by floods of well-formatted bullshit,
    and are slowly picking up more and more of the jobs that academia is abdicating.
    The 21st century’s most influential philosopher, so far, is an uncredentialed
    blogger and fanfiction author who lacks even a high school diploma. When it comes
    to understanding of how society works, academia still has a lock on the lowest
    common denominator, but a growing fraction of the intellectual elite are leaving
    behind the institutions for internet self-publishing. Even archaeology is seeing
    some efforts to work outside of the academy, with well-funded projects like the
    “Vesuvius Challenge” to decipher the Herculaneum Papyri. Whether the universities
    can reverse course, and if not then how long it will take before they are simply
    left behind, remains to be seen.
