- en: Call it the gig economy, the passion economy, or side hustles, over half of
    Gen Z workers are now getting paid with 1099 contracts. Tax law is complicated,
    and many freelancers are overwhelmed. They can't afford a personal bookkeeper,
    and don't have time to dig into the details of what counts as a write-off. As
    a result, they're leaving thousands of dollars on the table at tax time.

    Keeper understands all the minutiae of tax law, responds in minutes instead of
    days, and creates a personalized tax filing experience for each user based on
    the forms they upload.
