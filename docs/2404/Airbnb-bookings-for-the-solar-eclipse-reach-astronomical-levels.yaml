- en: THE MOON would not start to move between Earth and the sun until the morning
    of April 8th. But the business impact of this month’s [total solar eclipse](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/04/02/why-are-total-solar-eclipses-so-rare),
    which started over the Pacific Ocean, cut a path across North America and ended
    in the Atlantic, was already plain to see. According to Jamie Lane of AirDNA,
    a travel-data firm, on a typical Sunday night in April around 30% of homes listed
    for short-term rental on Airbnb or Vrbo in areas in or around the eclipse’s path
    were occupied. A remarkable 92% of listings within the zone of totality had been
    booked for April 7th. Demand for homes just a few towns outside this roughly 180km-wide
    strip had barely changed.

- en: The eclipse was visible from a handful of big or biggish cities, including Dallas,
    Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo and Montreal. CoStar, a hotel-data provider,
    reckons that occupancy rates in those places were up anywhere from 12 percentage
    points (in Montreal) to 67 (in Indianapolis). The remaining rooms appeared to
    be available only at elevated prices. Ahead of the eclipse the *New York Times*
    reported that nearly half of Super 8 motels in its path with rooms still available
    were charging at least twice the standard rate.
