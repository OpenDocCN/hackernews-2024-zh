    in 2012, Rousey had built a formidable 15-0 record in which her bouts lasted an
    average 34 seconds. But her ferocity was built on a hidden vulnerability. Rousey
    had suffered so many concussions in judo that she knew her brain could not withstand
    multiple more blows to the head. It was vital that she brought her fights in the
    UFC to a violent conclusion before she absorbed much punishment.

    I was like ‘Where am I?’ And then it’s a case of ‘Oh yeah’.”'

    Her [new book](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/456155/our-fight-by-rousey-ronda/9781529912388),
    written with her sister Maria Burns Ortiz, is often gripping and, at its best,
    offers a raw personal history of concussion. She began judo at the age of 11 and,
    driven by the aim of winning an Olympic gold medal, Rousey tried to evade the
    fact “I’d been compounding concussion after concussion for so many years”.

    year as a young woman. “It’s hard to say because I wouldn’t rest when I had a
    concussion. I would continue to train and keep re-aggravating it. So instead of
    having symptoms for a few days, I would have them for weeks or even months. Most
    of the year I would be having concussion symptoms. There are grades of severity
    but my worst was being thrown on the back of my head at the Pan-American [Judo]
    Championships in Argentina. I completely blacked out till the next morning.”

    young age. It became a way of life.”'

    in the public domain. “My mother just didn’t understand concussion,” she says.
    “Nobody did because research only started coming out towards the end of my judo
    career. I was afraid of it and tried to suppress it. I’d had so many more concussions
    than anybody else in a 10-year judo career and so when I started doing [MMA](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/mma)
    I didn’t want anyone to know. They already had enough reasons to try and stop
    me going into MMA and then the UFC. I didn’t want to give them any more about
    concussion and I was lucky to have the skills to win most fights really quick.”
    Rousey is suitably scathing about the ignorant machismo that haunts MMA and boxing:
    “People talk about your ‘chin’ with such reverence. It’s thrown around like it’s
    a personality trait or a sign of your willpower to absorb blows. That’s another
    reason why I never wanted to talk about concussion. It felt like it was a personal
    weakness and not a neurological degeneration I’ve been experiencing since I was
    a child.”'
