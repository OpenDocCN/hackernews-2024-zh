# **About us**

Ego is building an AI-native game, engine, and platform where users can create and share 3D animated characters, worlds, games and scripted interactions all using natural language. We started by building a survivalcraft game similar to Valheim and Minecraft with an Animal Crossing/Sims-style village in the town. All the npcs/villagers will be powered by LLM agents where they’ll have their own lives, personalities, and routines. The game will allow you to mod the game while you play it with natural language instead of coding.

We’re looking for someone passionate about playing and making games who ships fast, is interested in trying new technologies, and works well in a small team of game developers, designers, and technical artists. If you like the sound of making games, pushing the boundaries of gaming technology, and you thrive in a fast-paced startup environment, we'd love to hear from you!
