    details an attempt to simulate the [IBM ‘quantum utility’ experiment](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-unlocks-quantum-utility-127-qubit-eagle)
    on a Commodore 64\. The idea might seem preposterous - pitting a 40-year-old home
    computer against a device powered by [127-Qubit ‘Eagle’](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-127-qubit-eagle-quantum-processor)
    quantum processing unit (QPU). However, the anonymous researcher(s) conclude that
    the ‘Qommodore 64’ performed faster, and more efficiently, than [IBM](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm)’s
    pride-and-joy, while being “decently accurate on this problem.”

  zh: 在[2024年SIGBOVIK会议](http://sigbovik.org/)期间发布的一篇论文详细描述了试图在Commodore 64上模拟[IBM的‘量子实用性’实验](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-unlocks-quantum-utility-127-qubit-eagle)的尝试。这个想法似乎很荒谬
    - 将一台40年历史的家用电脑与由[127量子比特‘Eagle’](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-127-qubit-eagle-quantum-processor)量子处理单元（QPU）驱动的设备进行比较。然而，匿名研究人员得出结论，‘Qommodore
    64’的表现更快，更有效，比[IBM](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm)的自豪产品“在这个问题上表现相当准确”。
- en: At the beginning of the paper, the researchers admit that their ‘Qommodore 64’
    project is “a joke,” but, sadly for IBM, its proof of quantum utility was also
    built upon shaky foundations, and the Qommodore 64 team came up with some convincing-looking
    [benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark). There was some controversy
    about IBM’s claims at the time, and we are reminded it took just five days for
    the quantum experiment to be [simulated](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010308#fulltext)
    on an ordinary [MacBook M1 Pro](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-m1-13-inch-2020)
    laptop. The jokey Quantum Disadvantage paper ([PDF link](https://www.sigbovik.org/2024/proceedings.pdf),
    headlining section starts at page 199) ports this experiment to a machine packing
    the far more humble MOS Technology 6510 processor.

  zh: 在论文开头，研究人员承认他们的‘Qommodore 64’项目是“一个笑话”，但令IBM感到遗憾的是，其量子实用性的证明也建立在摇摇欲坠的基础上，而‘Qommodore
    64’团队提出了一些看似令人信服的[基准](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark)。当时，IBM的声明引起了一些争议，我们被提醒，这个量子实验在一台普通的[MacBook
    M1 Pro](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-m1-13-inch-2020)笔记本电脑上模拟仅用了五天。笑话性的量子劣势论文（[PDF链接](https://www.sigbovik.org/2024/proceedings.pdf)，主要部分从第199页开始）将这个实验移植到一台装有更为谦卑的MOS
    Technology 6510处理器的机器上。

- en: To get deep into the weeds with the quantum theory and math behind the quantum
    utility experiment, please follow the above PDF link. However, to summarize, the
    C64-based experiment uses the sparse Pauli dynamics technique developed by Beguŝić,
    Hejazi, and Chan to approximate the behavior of ferromagnetic materials. Famously,
    IBM claimed such calculations were “too difficult to perform on a classical computer
    to an acceptable accuracy, using the leading approximation techniques,” recalls
    the paper. Not quite, and as already mentioned above, an ordinary laptop can obtain
    similar results.

  zh: 要深入研究量子实用性实验背后的量子理论和数学，请参阅上述PDF链接。然而，简要总结，基于Commodore 64的实验使用了Beguŝić、Hejazi和Chan开发的稀疏Pauli动力学技术，以近似铁磁材料的行为。文章回顾道，IBM曾声称这些计算“使用领先的近似技术在传统计算机上执行起来太困难，难以达到可接受的精度”。然而，并不尽然，正如上文所述，普通笔记本电脑可以获得类似的结果。
- en: The anonymous C64 user(s) provide some interesting details of their quantum-defeating
    feat. Their aggressively truncated and shallow depth-first search model used just
    15kB of the spacious 64kB available on the [iconic Commodore machine](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/history-of-computers,4518-27.html).
    Meanwhile, the final code consisted of about 2,500 lines of 6502 assembly, stored
    on a cartridge that fitted in the C64’s expansion port. This code was handled
    by the mighty 1 MHz 8-bit [MOS 6510 CPU](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-powers-c64-cartridge).
    The C64 took approx 4 minutes per data point. (Testing the same code on a modern
    laptop achieved roughly 800μs per data point.)

- en: In conclusion, the researcher(s) asserts that the ‘Qommodore 64’ is “faster
    than the quantum device datapoint-for-datapoint… it is much more energy efficient…
    and it is decently accurate on this problem.” On the topic of how applicable this
    research is to other quantum problems, it is snarkily suggested that “it probably
    won’t work on almost any other problem (but then again, neither do quantum computers
    right now).” Overall, it is difficult to know whether the results are entirely
    genuine, though a lot of detail is provided and the linked research references
    in the paper seem genuine.

    enthusiasts, as well as DIYers and makers. So it is good to know that the author(s)
    of this paper say that they will provide source code to allow others to replicate
    their results. However, source code will only be supplied in one of three formats,
    they say: “a copy handwritten on papyrus, a slide-show of blurry screenshots recorded
    on a VHS tape, or that I dictate it to you personally over the phone.” So please
    add an extra pinch of salt to this story for that.'
