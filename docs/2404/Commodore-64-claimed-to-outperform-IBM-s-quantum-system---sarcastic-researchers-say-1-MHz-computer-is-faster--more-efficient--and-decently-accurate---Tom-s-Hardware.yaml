- en: A paper released during the [SIGBOVIK 2024](http://sigbovik.org/) conference
    details an attempt to simulate the [IBM ‘quantum utility’ experiment](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-unlocks-quantum-utility-127-qubit-eagle)
    on a Commodore 64\. The idea might seem preposterous - pitting a 40-year-old home
    computer against a device powered by [127-Qubit ‘Eagle’](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-127-qubit-eagle-quantum-processor)
    quantum processing unit (QPU). However, the anonymous researcher(s) conclude that
    the ‘Qommodore 64’ performed faster, and more efficiently, than [IBM](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm)’s
    pride-and-joy, while being “decently accurate on this problem.”

- en: At the beginning of the paper, the researchers admit that their ‘Qommodore 64’
    project is “a joke,” but, sadly for IBM, its proof of quantum utility was also
    built upon shaky foundations, and the Qommodore 64 team came up with some convincing-looking
    [benchmarks](https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/benchmark). There was some controversy
    about IBM’s claims at the time, and we are reminded it took just five days for
    the quantum experiment to be [simulated](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010308#fulltext)
    on an ordinary [MacBook M1 Pro](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/macbook-pro-m1-13-inch-2020)
    laptop. The jokey Quantum Disadvantage paper ([PDF link](https://www.sigbovik.org/2024/proceedings.pdf),
    headlining section starts at page 199) ports this experiment to a machine packing
    the far more humble MOS Technology 6510 processor.

- en: To get deep into the weeds with the quantum theory and math behind the quantum
    utility experiment, please follow the above PDF link. However, to summarize, the
    C64-based experiment uses the sparse Pauli dynamics technique developed by Beguŝić,
    Hejazi, and Chan to approximate the behavior of ferromagnetic materials. Famously,
    IBM claimed such calculations were “too difficult to perform on a classical computer
    to an acceptable accuracy, using the leading approximation techniques,” recalls
    the paper. Not quite, and as already mentioned above, an ordinary laptop can obtain
    similar results.

- en: The anonymous C64 user(s) provide some interesting details of their quantum-defeating
    feat. Their aggressively truncated and shallow depth-first search model used just
    15kB of the spacious 64kB available on the [iconic Commodore machine](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/history-of-computers,4518-27.html).
    Meanwhile, the final code consisted of about 2,500 lines of 6502 assembly, stored
    on a cartridge that fitted in the C64’s expansion port. This code was handled
    by the mighty 1 MHz 8-bit [MOS 6510 CPU](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-powers-c64-cartridge).
    The C64 took approx 4 minutes per data point. (Testing the same code on a modern
    laptop achieved roughly 800μs per data point.)

- en: In conclusion, the researcher(s) asserts that the ‘Qommodore 64’ is “faster
    than the quantum device datapoint-for-datapoint… it is much more energy efficient…
    and it is decently accurate on this problem.” On the topic of how applicable this
    research is to other quantum problems, it is snarkily suggested that “it probably
    won’t work on almost any other problem (but then again, neither do quantum computers
    right now).” Overall, it is difficult to know whether the results are entirely
    genuine, though a lot of detail is provided and the linked research references
    in the paper seem genuine.

    enthusiasts, as well as DIYers and makers. So it is good to know that the author(s)
    of this paper say that they will provide source code to allow others to replicate
    their results. However, source code will only be supplied in one of three formats,
    they say: “a copy handwritten on papyrus, a slide-show of blurry screenshots recorded
    on a VHS tape, or that I dictate it to you personally over the phone.” So please
    add an extra pinch of salt to this story for that.'
