> App Stores were a mistake.
> 
> Currently, we cannot update VLC on Windows Store, and we cannot update VLC on Android Play Store, without reducing security or dropping a lot of users…
> 
> For now, iOS App Store still allows us to ship for iOS9, but until when?

> If you do wonder why we don’t update VLC on the Windows Store or why VLC/iOS can’t connect properly to OneDrive shares, it’s because Microsoft Kafkaïesque bureaucracy refuses to help us.

> We’re only trying to contact someone since 2years…

> VLC cannot even enter the Mac App Store, because of the restrictions…

Look at all those platforms competing to benefit users.

> This here is a European app store for Android and Google’s [YouTube has just killed their channel](https://twitter.com/luishg/status/1778717325652341075). It’s obviously a problem if you depend on the incumbent’s platforms all the way.

> On Android, we can either give Google our private (!) key or not support existing Android versions, and there is (as usual for Google) no one to discuss this with.
> 
> On Windows, they changed soo many times the backend of their store, that even with support from the top of the hierarchy, we cannot even update our desktop apps (change a URL, not even a binary…)
> 
> Apple, so far, is less annoying, but to support old versions (iOS9 or 10) is an always on battle.
> 
> Apple AppStores does not allow GPL, Microsoft does not allow GPLv3 and Unity does not even allow LGPL…
> 
> It’s very frustrating and time consuming, but because we don’t make money out of those, and we are on more platforms than anyone, we can complain publically…
