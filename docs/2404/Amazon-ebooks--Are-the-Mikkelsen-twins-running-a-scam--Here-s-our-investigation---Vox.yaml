    If you’re mostly publishing trash books, you’re not going to get tons of five-star

    review and the one a real reader might leave. The results were extremely lucrative.

- en: The Mikkelsens are not the chief villains of this story. They are small-time
    operators working one level of a very big grift industry. The grift is that technology
    and retail platforms have incentivized a race to the bottom when it comes to selling
    books. Together, without ever caring enough about the issue to deliberately try
    to do so, they have built a landscape in which it’s hard to trust what you read
    and hard to sell what you write.

- en: The incentives of the modern book-selling economy for writers are to keep your
    costs low, low, low and your volume high, high, high, and definitely put your
    book on Amazon because where else are you going to sell an ebook? The incentive
    of the modern book-buying economy for readers is to go onto Amazon and lazily
    click around with a few search terms, and then buy the first book that looks right
    with the click of a single button. The incentives are, in other words, driving
    us all straight into a flood of garbage.

- en: That’s what the grift does. It finds every spot in the process of making and
    selling a book that is inconvenient or laborious, and it exploits those spots.
    It exploits our cultural belief that books are meaningful, that writing a book
    is a valuable act, that reading a book will enrich your life. When it’s finished,
    you’re left with something that’s not a real book but a book-shaped digital file
    filled with nothing of any use to anyone at all.
