- en: 'We received a new court order in the scope of this investigation. Short recap:
    this is an inquiry with the aim to identify individuals/groups behind a potential
    coordination of efforts to attack the institutions and the electoral system across
    different platforms. President Bolsonaro himself is investigated in this process,
    there is great public attention to this case as well as a legitimate concern with
    the integrity of the democratic system. We have received several unusual requests
    coming from this inquiry, the most recent one compelling us to provide an undetermined
    amount of user data based on hashtag mentions. The hashtags concern a mobilization
    around the elections - roughly translated as #PrintedVoteNO; #DemocraticAuditableVote
    and #BarrosoInJail - Barroso is the former TSE President. We were able to narrow
    down the request, with the Federal Police specifying what they wanted after a
    meeting.'

    provide us with copies of such tweets at the time.'

    us know how much time you estimate the team would be able to complete this pull,
    and also if there are any concerns or difficulties regarding this request. Our
    formal deadline to respond is 5 days (next Monday), but since we have a good relationship
    with them, we could ask for an extension.

    as you know, and while we understand that it may take a toll on the team, we also
    know how important it is to comply or, at least, have grounds to challenge the
    determination. Here is the background document on this entire investigation -
    updated with this new development.
