    of every key of its two, five-octave keyboards every few microseconds and was
    able to play back performances. Smith made the tech public in the hope that other

    the Gakki Music Fair in October 1981 he, with Ikutaro Kakehachi’s introduction,
    revealed it to representatives from Yamaha and Korg. It was well received, but
    its problems were obvious. Korg noted that the use of jack plugs to transmit the
    required signals would cause noise in the system. Plus, there were no provisions
    for synchronising sequencers to drum machines or a way for one machine to start
    and stop another.

    while the Japanese contingent began working with the name UMI (Universal Musical
    Interface - pronounced You-Me) Smith countered with Musical Instrument Digital
    Interface (similarly pronouncable as MIDI) to better convey its on-trend all-digital

    1982\. Every synth maker would be in town - Moog, ARP, Yamaha, Roland, Korg, Voyetra,

    to Jupiter 8 had been a big one, doubling the polyphony and the VCOs (up from
    one per voice to two), the move to Jupiter-6 was a gap-plugging exercise. The
    costly Jupiter-8 had been undercut by Roland's own Juno-6, 60 and 106, leaving
    a hole just big enough for a ‘baby 8’ with six-note polyphony.

    in the dust throughout the '80s. Controlling digital innards with analogue CV/Gate
