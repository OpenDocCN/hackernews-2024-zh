    He had been struck by the huge amounts of H5N1 virus he’d seen in milk from cows
    infected with the bird flu and thought that at least some virus was getting off
    of farms and going downstream — onto store shelves.

    of the milk supply. But he was impatient. So he and a graduate student went on
    a road trip: They collected 150 commercial milk products from around the Midwest,
    representing dairy processing plants in 10 different states, including some where
    herds have tested positive for H5N1\. Genetic testing found viral RNA in 58 samples,
    he told STAT.'

    is still very low. But the prevalence of viral genetic material in the products
    they sampled suggest that the H5N1 outbreak is likely far more widespread in dairy
    cows than official counts indicate. So far, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
    has reported 33 herds in eight states have tested positive for H5N1.

    H5N1 virus in samples of milk purchased from store shelves, but it provided no
    detailed results. On Thursday, during an online symposium hosted by the Association
    of State and Territorial Health Officials, the FDA disclosed a high-level readout
    from the agency’s investigation. Results returned Thursday morning showed PCR-positive
    milk in 20% of samples, “maybe with some preponderance for areas with known herds,”
    said Donald Prater, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied
    Nutrition. He did not say how many samples the FDA had analyzed or from what geographic
    area.

    results of those studies in the coming days. On Wednesday, Jeanne Marrazzo, the
    new director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told
    reporters that a team of NIAID-funded researchers had early data to [suggest that

    if we can recover any virus from them and we can’t,” Webby said.

    RNA. Bowman sent them to Webby to inject into plates of mammalian cells and embryonated
    chicken eggs and look for any signs of active viral replication. In order to do
    that, Webby needed a negative control, so he went and bought milk at a store near
    his lab in Memphis. But PCR testing found H5N1 RNA in that sample too, making
    it useless as a negative control, but an additional data point showing a lack
    of live virus.

    that the wider H5N1 spreads in cows, the more opportunities the virus has to adapt
    to transmit efficiently in mammalian hosts. It also increase the chances H5N1
    could get into pigs, where it could swap genes and form hybrids with other flu
    viruses. Viruses that mutate to be able to spread easily through one species of
    mammals could find it easier to infect people.

    zoonotic pathogens at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University

    disappears and their activity goes down. Then their milk production dries up.
    In some animals, the milk they do produce turns yellow and thick. “It’s an odd
    thing that seems to be unique to this particular virus,” said Keith Poulsen, director
    of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. And it’s one of the chief red
    flags that dairy farmers are supposed to be on the lookout for when deciding whether
    to test their herds. If milk from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cows looks normal
    but can carry virus, it would obscure the need for testing.

    transmission, it’s necessary to conduct widespread testing of animals with and

    we’re missing infections in those without.”

    across state lines. It also requires laboratories and state veterinarians to report
    to the USDA any animals that have tested positive for H5N1 or any other influenza
    A virus. But outside of interstate travel, testing remains voluntary and encouraged
    only for visibly ill animals.
