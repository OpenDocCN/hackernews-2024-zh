- en: Sima Qian (145–86 BC) is considered the foremost Chinese historian for his work,
    Records of the Grand Historian (in Chinese, *Shiji*). The work was started by
    his father, Sima Tan, an astrologer to the imperial court, and finished by Sima
    Qian in 94 BC. It covers a period of approximately 2000 years right until Han
    emperor Wudi’s reign (141-87 BC) and the author’s subsequent death.

  zh: 司马迁（公元前145–86年）因其著作《史记》而被认为是中国最重要的历史学家。该作品最初由他的父亲司马谈开始，司天监一职的皇室占星家，并由司马迁于公元前94年完成。《史记》覆盖了大约2000年的历史，直至汉武帝（公元前141-87年）统治时期及其后作者的去世。

    interest because contextualizing his demise within the time period tells us a
    great deal about Chinese imperial customs, legality and divinity.

  zh: 一位备受尊敬的朝廷官员如何遇害的故事之所以引人注目，是因为将他的死亡情境置于当时背景之中，可以告诉我们很多关于中国帝国的习俗、法律和神权的事情。
- en: We must start with the concept of Heaven’s Favour, also called Heaven’s Mandate.
    The idea is that the universe bestows upon a just ruler its favour, and that if
    an emperor is overthrown they must not have been worthy of the title. Natural
    disasters such as famine or flood were also seen as signs of an emperor being
    out of favour with divinity, and cause for many a coup.

  zh: 我们必须从天命这一概念开始。它意味着宇宙将其恩赐赐予正义的统治者，如果一个皇帝被推翻，那么他们必定不配担任这一头衔。像饥荒或洪水这样的自然灾害也被视为皇帝失宠于神明的迹象，这是发动政变的理由之一。
- en: Thus, a ruling emperor had ample motivation to be seen as infallible and perfect
    for any mistake could be seen as the emperor losing favour with Heaven. After
    all, if divinity had blessed you as the Son of Heaven, how could you possibly
    make a mistake? Surely, it could only be a sign that the blessing was no longer
    valid, and in the cut-throat court where murder lurked behind treachery, an emperor’s
    main defense was to eliminate any doubt of his infallibility and go on the offensive
    which very often meant mass execution of entire extended families.

  zh: 因此，一个执政的皇帝有充分的动机希望被视为无懈可击和完美的，因为任何错误都可能被视为皇帝失宠于天。毕竟，如果神性已经祝福你为天子，你怎么可能犯错呢？毫无疑问，这只能意味着祝福不再有效，而在刀光剑影的宫廷里，谋杀往往隐藏在背叛之后，一个皇帝的主要防御手段是消除他无懈可击的疑虑，并采取攻势，这往往意味着大规模屠杀整个家族。
- en: This was also a period where Confucian ideas were being applied in the court
    and the requirement that a ruler must be attuned to Heaven’s Mandate was central.
    According to Confucius (551-479 BC) the emperor had to be of exemplary moral standards,
    for only when the people saw his example would they be shamed into correcting
    themselves. Confucius preferred this method of keeping the public in order rather
    than laws and punishment which he believed to be ineffective. Though the philosopher
    also stated the importance of self-correction after errors, this did not seem
    to apply to emperors due to the elevated status bestowed through Heaven’s Mandate.
    This contradiction seems to be swept under the carpet throughout early Chinese
    history.

  zh: 这也是儒家思想在朝廷中应用的时期，要求统治者必须顺应天命是核心。根据孔子（公元前551-479年）的观点，皇帝必须具有卓越的道德标准，因为只有当人们看到他的榜样时，他们才会羞于改正自己。孔子更喜欢通过这种方式来保持公众秩序，而不是依靠法律和惩罚，他认为后者是无效的。尽管这位哲学家也强调了错误后的自我修正的重要性，但这似乎并不适用于皇帝，因为他们通过天命获得了尊贵的地位。这种矛盾在中国早期历史中似乎被掩盖了。
- en: Rivals of the emperor often successfully employed the tactic of making an emperor
    look like he had lost Heaven’s Favour to stage revolts, especially in cases where
    regents presided over the empire while the emperor came of age. One such instance
    was how the regent Zhao Gao took out a young emperor. Gao gave the emperor a gift
    of a deer while calling it a horse. When the emperor pointed out that this in
    fact was not a horse at all but a deer, Gao had his collaborators in court “confirm”
    that it in fact was a horse, and that something must be wrong with His Majesty’s
    condition. Other collaborators pointed out how the emperor had recently slurred
    his words at a liturgy, and that was that. The emperor was soon advised to poison
    himself to avoid capture from a phantom army who had sensed him losing Heaven’s
    Favour. He did just that.

  zh: 皇帝的竞争对手常常成功地利用这种策略让皇帝看起来失去了天意，从而策动叛乱，特别是在摄政者管理帝国的同时，皇帝正在年幼时。赵高摄政期间，就曾如此处理一位年轻皇帝。赵高送给皇帝一只鹿作为礼物，却说这是匹马。当皇帝指出这实际上根本不是马，而是鹿时，赵高的合谋者们在朝廷上“确认”这确实是一匹马，并暗示皇帝的状态有问题。其他合谋者指出，皇帝最近在祭祀时口齿不清，于是，皇帝很快被建议服毒自尽，以避免被一支幽灵军队俘虏，因为他们察觉到他失去了天意。最终，皇帝照办了。
- en: With that in mind we’ll return to our protagonist, Sima Qian who in 99 BC, 13
    years before his death, was busy writing a chapter of Shiji while a war raged
    on. Emperor Wu’s campaign against the Xiongnu, a tribal confederacy to the north,
    was not going too well. His main appointed general was Li Guangli who was also
    his brother in law. Serving under Li Guangli was another general, Li Ling. Li
    Guangli had not anticipated the swiftness of the Xiongnu on the northern terrains
    and had limped back to defeat. Of the 100,000 men that marched north under him
    only 10,000 returned. However, the emperor not wanting to blame anyone in his
    family, blamed Li Ling for the military failure. None of the meek government officials
    wanted to challenge the emperor on this flawed take for fear of suggesting Heaven’s
    Favour had been tampered with, and nodded their heads in agreement.

  zh: 那么，我们回到我们的主人公司马迁，他在公元前99年，距离他去世还有13年的时候，正在撰写《史记》的一章，而战争正在进行中。吴皇对匈奴的北方部落联盟的战役并不顺利。他的主要任命的将军是李广利，同时也是他的姐夫。在李广利的统帅下，还有另一位将军李陵。李广利没有预料到匈奴在北方地区的迅猛进攻，最终溃败而归。他率领的10万大军只有1万人幸存。然而，皇帝不愿责怪家中任何人，却指责李陵导致军事失败。没有一个胆怯的官员敢挑战这个错误的看法，因为他们害怕这样做会暗示天意被篡改，于是都只是点头附和。

    severely underestimated the complexity of the windswept northern terrains and
    led his forces to a military failure so significant that he was at first refused
    entry back into Han territory after his retreat. Li Ling on the other hand, with
    just 5,000 infantry had fought for weeks against impossible odds until there wasn’t
    an arrow in a quiver left. Though Sima Qian was not a friend of Li Ling, he respected
    him and sought to “broaden His Majesty’s views” on the events of the war. Instead,
    he was accused of trying to exonerate Li Ling in order to disparage Li Guangli,
    and in turn put into question the emperor’s judgement, for it was the Emperor
    Wu who had appointed Li Guangli and of course, losing a war could easily be seen
    as losing Heaven’s Favour. That at all costs needed to be avoided and thus Sima
    Qian was sentenced to death by suicide. This was hardly a controversial sentence
    as noted by John Keay:'

  zh: 李陵的勇气和军事才智是毋庸置疑的。李广利严重低估了风吹日晒的北方地形的复杂性，导致了如此重大的军事失败，以至于他最初在撤退后无法进入汉国境内。而李陵，带着仅有的5000名步兵，对抗了数周，直到箭矢用尽。尽管司马迁并不是李陵的朋友，但他尊重他，并试图“开阔陛下的视野”，讲述战争事件的真相。然而，他却被指控试图为李陵辩护，以诋毁李广利，并进而质疑皇帝的判断，因为正是吴皇任命了李广利，当然，战败很容易被视为天意不利。必须尽一切努力避免这种情况，因此司马迁被判处死刑自尽。如约翰·凯所言，这并不是一个有争议的判决：
- en: For in the Confucian ideal, officials attracted by the magnetic effect of the
    emperor’s moral example were supposed to be sufficiently righteous and high-minded
    to recognize their guilt and penalise themselves. Not to do would be to acknowledge
    their inadequacy for office in the first place and to cast a slur on the judgement
    and moral calibre of the emperor, a surefire way to a death yet more painful.
    Except as a delaying tactic, it was pointless to to plead one’s innocence. Imprisonment
    pending trail was a euphemism for torture pending confession.

    desperately for options. There were two other than death. The first was the purchase

    into the lowest strata of society where nothing but humiliation, derision and

    Han empire came to be, the Confucian ideals that motivated it, the administrative
    and political aspects that drove it, and much more. True to scholarship, Sima
    Qian in Shiji, as John Keay notes, “has enough innuendoes to alert posterity to
    both the emperor’s failings and his own likely bias”. In such times, the truth
    needed to be read between the lines.
