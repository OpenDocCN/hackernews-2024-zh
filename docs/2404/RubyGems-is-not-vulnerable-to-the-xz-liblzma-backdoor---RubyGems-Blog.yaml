- en: The past few days have seen the security world focused on the revelation of
    the [xz/liblzma backdoor](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2024/xz-vuln/). For more background,
    see [this early writeup of the issue](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2024/xz-vuln/),
    [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27),
    [this detailed timeline](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor),
    and the official detail page for [CVE-2024-3094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094).

    not just of the software used to run RubyGems.org itself, but also every gem that
    has ever been published.

    we are happy to confirm that no gem currently published on RubyGems.org contains
    the vulnerable `liblzma` library.

    in this investigation, and for their continued dedication to the security of the
    ecosystem. I would also like to thank AWS for their continued support of RubyGems
    security, including sponsoring me as [Ruby Central’s security engineer in residence](https://rubycentral.org/news/ruby-central-welcomes-new-software-engineer-in-residence-sponsored-by-aws/),
    as well as funding the [rubygems-research](https://github.com/segiddins/rubygems-research)
    project.

    we were able to quickly confirm that no currently published gems contain any references
    to the vulnerable `liblzma` library.

- en: The RubyGems.org app containers, built [via Dockerfile](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/master/Dockerfile),
    do not contain vulnerable versions of `liblzma` nor `xz`. Our images are based
    on [Alpine 3.18 stable](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/master/Dockerfile#L5),
    which never contained or had access to the vulnerable library version. In addition,
    Alpine Linux uses the `musl` libc, which does not contain the (glibc-only) [IFUNC
    mechanism](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC) used to activate the backdoor.

    via GitHub Actions after every commit to the public RubyGems.org codebase. The
    [latest container build job logs](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/actions/runs/8498544592/job/23278360812)
    can be used to reproduce the build by any interested parties.

    only on version 5.4.3 and not on the vulnerable versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.

    is the [gem also named liblzma](https://rubygems.org/gems/liblzma). That gem contains
    only versions 0.2 and 0.3 of the library, which do not contain the backdoor. There
    are zero gems that contain the `xz` command-line tool.

    `xz` 命令行工具的宝石。
