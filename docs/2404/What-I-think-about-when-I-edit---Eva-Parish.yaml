    to short stories to documentation. Recently, someone asked me *how* I edit. What

    the same basic editing techniques to all.

    Instead of saying “this” or “that,” you should add a noun to spell out exactly

    subordinate (or dependent) clause when it comes at the start of a sentence](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/independent_and_dependent_clauses/index.html).
    Besides being “correct,” the comma helps the reader pause and process what they’ve
