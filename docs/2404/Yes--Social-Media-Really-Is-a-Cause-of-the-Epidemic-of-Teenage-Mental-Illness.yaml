    From novels in the 18th century to the bicycle in the 19th and through comic books,
    rock and roll, marijuana, and violent video games in the 20th century, there are
    always those who ring alarms, and there are always [those who are skeptics of
    those alarms](https://parents.simonandschuster.com/9781982159597). So far, the
    skeptics have been right more often than not, and when they are right, they earn
    the right to call the alarm ringers “alarmists” who have fomented a groundless
    moral panic, usually through sensational but rare (or non-existent) horror stories
    trumpeted by irresponsible media.

    The essay offered a critique of my recent book, *The Anxious Generation*. Odgers’
    primary criticism is that I have mistaken correlation for causation and that “there
    is no evidence that using these platforms is rewiring children’s brains or driving
    an epidemic of mental illness.”  She also warns that my ringing of a false alarm
    “might distract us from effectively responding to the real causes of the current
    mental-health crisis in young people,” which, she suggests, are social ills such
    as racism, economic hardship, and the lingering impact of the 2008 Global Financial
    Crisis and its disparate impact on children in low SES families.'

    American Mind*, it was true that the great majority of published studies on “digital
    media” and mental health were correlational, and every social scientist knows
    that correlational studies often suggest to our intuitive minds a causal pathway
    that vanishes when experiments using random assignment are published. (Think of
    the changing guidance on the health effects of fat, carbs, and red wine). But
    even in 2018 there were a few [experimental](https://doi.org/10.1080/15213269.2016.1257392)  [studies](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-19176-040)

    to reduce their social media use for three weeks generally experienced mental
    health benefits compared to the control group. Zach Rausch, Jean Twenge, and I
    began to collect all the studies we could find in 2019, and we organized them

    relationship in which heavy users of social media are at much higher risk of mental
    illness or poor mental health than everyone else. A [widely cited 2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6537508/)
    of 14-year-olds found that girls who spend five hours or more on social media
    per day are *three times as likely to be depressed* as girls who use social media
    only a little or not at all. For boys, the ratio is lower, closer to two-to-one.

    media does *not* cause harm to teen mental health), then the published studies
    would just reflect random noise and Type I errors (believing something that is
    false). In that case, we’d see experimental studies producing a wide range of
    findings, including many that showed *benefits* to mental health from using social
    media (or that showed harm to those who go off of social media for a few weeks).
    Yet there are hardly any such experimental findings. Most experiments find evidence
    of negative effects; some find no evidence of such effects, and very few show
    benefits. Also, if the null hypothesis were true, then we’d find some studies
    where the effects were larger for boys and some that found larger effects for
    girls. Yet that’s not what we find. When a sex difference is reported, it almost
    always shows more harm to girls and women. There is a clear and consistent signal
    running through the experimental studies (as well as the correlational studies),
    a signal that is not consistent with the null hypothesis.

    sugar, and then looks for the size of the dose-response relationship in individuals.
    But much of my book is about the *collective action traps* that entire communities
    of adolescents fall into when they move their social lives onto these platforms,
    such that it becomes costly to abstain. It is at that point that collective mental
    health declines most sharply, and the individuals who try to quit find that they
    are socially isolated. The skeptics do not consider the ways that these network

    “real causes” rather than being “distracted” by mine, then the way forward is
    to first solve society’s biggest social problems, most of which we have been working
    on for decades. Perhaps this time we’ll make more progress, and in ten or twenty
    years, rates of teen mental illness will begin to decline.

    decade or two locked in the usual culture war battles over spending on social
    programs that may or may not be effective, and we will have lost another generation
    to mental illness.

    collapse of adolescent mental health in the early 2010s was not *caused* by the
    arrival of phone-based childhood; it was just a big coincidence. Will kids be
    damaged by these four norms? I don’t think so. What irreversible harm will be
    done to children who spend more time listening to their teachers during class,
    more time playing and exploring together outdoors, and less time sitting alone
    hunched over a device?

    false alarms. God bless the skeptics. But at a certain point, we need to take

    we have the correct causal theory. I think that point is now.
