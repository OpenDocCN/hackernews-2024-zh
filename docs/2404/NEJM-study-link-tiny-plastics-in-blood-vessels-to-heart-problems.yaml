- en: Micro and nanoplastics, tiny pieces of plastic scattered throughout the environment,
    have been increasingly found to be able to enter the body, raising questions about
    where they end up and how they affect people’s health. In a new study, researchers
    say they have for the first time detected these plastic pieces inside fatty plaques
    that accumulate in blood vessels and linked them to an increased rate of heart
    problems.

- en: Researchers found that people who had these plastic pieces in their plaques
    experienced a 4.5-fold greater risk of major complications including heart attacks,
    strokes, or death compared to those with plastic-free plaques, according to the
    study, [published](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822) Wednesday
    in the New England Journal of Medicine.

    who had plastic detected in their plaques experienced a complication, compared
    with eight out of 107 — or 7.5% — of patients who didn’t have plastic identified.

    which is used in plastic bags and bottles, and polyvinyl chloride, which is used
    in pipes, insulation, and medical devices.'

    caused a greater risk of problems, but it does find an important link between
    microplastics and cardiovascular complications that should be probed in future
    studies, they said.

    found all across the environment, from food and water sources to the atmosphere.
    The issue is expected to [worsen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10475515/)
    with climate change, as rising temperatures accelerate the breakdown of plastic
    products. Studies so far have found microplastics to be harmful in mice and have
    also detected them in different parts of the human body — like the placenta, liver,
    and lungs — but there has been less research showing how much microplastics actually
    affect people’s health.

    geographic locale,” said Sanjay Rajagopalan, an author on the study and chief
    of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. What
    “we don’t know is do they have significant health effects and should we really
    worry about them? What are the long-term effects?”

- en: The study included about 300 people in Italy who underwent carotid endarterectomies,
    a type of surgery to remove the buildup of fatty plaques in blood vessels. The
    accumulation of these plaques over time can block vessels and lead to heart attacks
    or strokes.

- en: The plaques collected from the surgeries were frozen and then analyzed by the
    researchers. They used microscopic techniques and chemical analyses to find jagged
    pieces of plastic embedded in the plaques.

    the researchers looked at markers of inflammation — including interleukin-18,
    interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and TNF-α — and found that the amount of plastic
    pieces in plaques correlated with levels of these inflammatory markers.

    wasn’t involved in the study, said a next step of this research could be to understand
    the mechanisms that could explain how the microplastics might increase inflammation
    and lead to heart problems. One avenue to investigate is whether chemicals from
    the plastics leached into the plaques, said Zhou, who studies the chemicals inside
    plastic products.

    “this is a much-needed analysis,” said Tim O’Toole, an associate professor of
    medicine at the University of Louisville who also wasn’t involved in the study.

    because of global climate change,” said O’Toole, who has been researching the
    effects of pollutants on heart outcomes. “The increased temperature will increase
    the breakdown of these contaminants, and they’ll be even more and more a problem
    in our water supplies, in the food chain.”
