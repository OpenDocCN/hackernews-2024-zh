- en: With our current pricing, developers on the Pro plan have some included usage
    in the first $20/mo plan, and then can pay for additional usage on demand after
    the included amount has been reached. For example, bandwidth. The first 1TB is
    included at $20/mo, and then after it is $40/100GB.
  id: totrans-split-26

- en: This is not ideal for two reasons. First, there are multiple services included
    in the “bandwidth” price, including Fast Data Transfer, Fast Origin Transfer,
    and Edge Requests. With our improved infrastructure pricing, these metrics are
    now separate to allow you to optimize each individually. We still have included
    usage in the base $20/mo. Your first 1TB of Fast Data Transfer, 100GB of Fast
    Origin Transfer, and 10 million Edge Requests are included. When you exceed these
    values, you can accrue usage of each metric separately.
  id: totrans-split-27

- en: Second, usage was previously packaged into 100GB increments. If you used 1GB
    of on-demand usage after your plan's included amount, you would've been charged
    $40\. With our improved infrastructure pricing, you're only charged $0.15 rather
    than $15.
