- en: I went to type in my 2FA code on a website - but no numbers appeared on screen.
    Obviously, I was an idiot and had forgotten to press the NumLock button. D'oh!
    I toggled it on and typed again. No numbers appeared. I switched to another tab,
    my numbers appeared when I typed them. So I was reasonably confident that my keyboard
    was working.

    typing the numbers using the number row on my keyboard. My 2FA code appeared.

- en: Developers often use JavaScript to "improve" the standard features of HTML.
    For example, using `<input type="number">` has some [accessibility concerns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#accessibility_concerns)
    and using [`inputmode="numeric"`](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-inputmode/#aa-numeric)
    is great for showing a number key board on mobile, but not much else.

    Fair enough.

    it to see what keyboard buttons your browser can detect.

    developers need to test on something other than MacBooks? Perhaps JavaScript was
    a mistake and the Web would be better without it?
