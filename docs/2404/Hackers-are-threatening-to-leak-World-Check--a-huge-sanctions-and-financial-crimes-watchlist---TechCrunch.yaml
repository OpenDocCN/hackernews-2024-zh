    KYC), allowing companies to determine if prospective customers are high risk or
    potential criminals, such as people with links to money laundering or who are
    under government sanctions. The hackers told TechCrunch that they stole the data
    from a Singapore-based firm with access to the World-Check database, but did not
    name the firm.

    data file. This was illegally obtained from the third party’s system. We are liaising
