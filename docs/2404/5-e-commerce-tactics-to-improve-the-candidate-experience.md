# 5 e-commerce tactics to improve the candidate experience

Today’s tech workers expect a job application experience that’s as enticing and effortless as the online consumer experience they’re accustomed to in their daily lives. A clunky, outdated, or prolonged online application process could be a big turnoff for top talent and create a perception that your company is behind the times.

You can help secure high-quality talent—and accelerate your hiring process—by designing your hiring and onboarding flow to mirror an online retail checkout experience. Here are five e-commerce best practices you can adopt to improve your candidate experience, fill your recruiting pipeline, and streamline your hiring flow.

The ideal e-commerce experience is frictionless, and your recruiting process should be frictionless for candidates, too. The job application is your first chance to make a positive impression on top talent and demonstrate that you’re a cutting-edge employer. An overly complex or confusing application process conveys a poor impression of your organization, reflects an outdated approach to corporate hiring, and could deter qualified candidates.

To put it very simply: Think about creating a resume or application submission flow that’s as easy to finish as it is to order pizza delivery online. Your application should flow seamlessly and intuitively, with clear, easy-to-follow directions. To improve performance, e-commerce sites constantly test content and form flows. Consider refining your application process using the same mindset, and focus on improving your user experience based on quantifiable metrics.

## Win top talent with a frictionless hiring experience

Checking out on a retail website is typically a three-step process—review the shopping cart, provide payment information, and place the order. How many clicks, pages, or steps must your candidates complete to apply for a position? Reducing the number of manual steps required to “check out” can increase engagement and keep qualified candidates in the funnel.

Keep in mind that candidates with advanced degrees and experience working in tech may be turned off by lengthy or redundant applications. Many companies are adopting the “one-click apply” approach for positions where just a resume or LinkedIn profile is sufficient for initial candidate vetting. Look for ways to shorten your application process, like ATS integrations that minimize clicks to apply, eliminating redundant questions in favor of resume-only applications, and utilizing low-lift features like “yes or no” questions, dropdowns, and checkboxes.

Busy professionals have limited time for job hunting and don’t want to use their work computers for job applications. Skilled tech workers on the hunt for their next opportunity may spend any spare minute scrolling job postings on their phone. If your listings and applications aren’t designed for mobile access, you risk candidates taking one look and moving on.

Use a mobile-first approach to job application and messaging design so candidates can complete applications, communicate with your talent acquisition team, and check the status of their application on their phones at any time. Mobile functionality means greater privacy and convenience—and that means a better candidate experience.

## Make your hiring flow as effortless as online shopping

Just as online shoppers are notified when their order has been placed, shipped, or delayed, job candidates want to know how their application is progressing. The best candidates typically have multiple options; if they don’t hear from you, they may accept another job offer or lose interest.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help keep candidates informed by automating tasks like application status notifications, scheduling interviews, providing ETAs for background checks, and reminding candidates to complete important steps like signing consent forms. Recruitment and onboarding is one of the top three areas where HR professionals believe AI can deliver immediate value, according to Workday’s [](https://forms.workday.com/en-us/reports/global-chro-ai-indicator/form.html?step=step2_default) [Global CHRO AI Indicator Report](https://forms.workday.com/en-us/reports/global-chro-ai-indicator/form.html?step=step2_default). Increased productivity is the top benefit respondents expect to see, translating to reduced time to fill positions and faster conversion of top talent. 

E-commerce shoppers expect robust customer service options from retailers; job candidates expect the same from you. Provide multiple customer service formats so candidates can get help in the way they prefer.

For example, create FAQs to answer common questions or a library of quick how-to articles to guide users through the application process. When candidates need more help, they should have access to live customer support teams via phone, email, or chat. You can also give candidates access to a dedicated portal or account they can use to check on application status. Making the support experience feel personal and customized also goes a long way toward creating a positive impression of your brand and company culture.

The tech job market is highly competitive, but delivering a frictionless candidate experience can help you land top-tier candidates. Create a smooth candidate journey by working with the right hiring technology partners to streamline essential steps, like background screenings.
