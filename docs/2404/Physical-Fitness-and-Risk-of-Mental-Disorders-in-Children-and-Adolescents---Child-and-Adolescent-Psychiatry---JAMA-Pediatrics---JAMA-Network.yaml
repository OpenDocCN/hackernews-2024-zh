- en: '**Findings**  This nationwide cohort study, encompassing 1.9 million participants
    in Taiwan, revealed that children and adolescents in better-performing fitness
    quantiles exhibited lower cumulative incidences of anxiety disorders, depressive
    disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Notably, enhanced cardiorespiratory
    fitness, muscular endurance, and muscular power were independently associated
    with reduced mental disorder incidences in this demographic, even after accounting
    for confounding factors.'

    from the Taiwan National Student Fitness Tests and National Health Insurance Research
    Databases from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019\. Participants were divided
    into 2 cohorts targeting anxiety and depression (1 996 633 participants) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
    disorder (ADHD; 1 920 596 participants). Participants were aged 10 to 11 years
    at study entry and followed up for at least 3 years, had a nearly equal gender
    distribution, and an average follow-up of 6 years. Data were analyzed from October
    2022 to February 2024.'

    (CF), muscular endurance (ME), muscular power (MP), and flexibility, measured
    through an 800-m run time, bent-leg curl-ups, standing broad jump, and sit-and-reach
    test, respectively.'

    incidence of anxiety, depression, and ADHD across fitness quartiles. Additionally,
    multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used that included all 4 fitness
    components and explored sex and income as modifiers.'

    participants were male [51.9%], and the median [IQR] age was 10.6 [10.3-11.0]
    years), while the ADHD cohort had 1 920 596 (975 568 participants were male [51.9%],
    and the median [IQR] age was 10.6 [10.3-11.0] years). Cumulative incidence of
    mental disorders was lower among participants in better-performing fitness quartiles,
    suggesting a dose-dependent association. Gender-specific analyses, controlling
    for confounders, revealed that improved CF, indicated by a 30-second decrease
    in run times, was associated with reduced risks of anxiety, depression, and ADHD
    in female participants, and lower risks of anxiety and ADHD in male participants
    (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for ADHD risk for female participants, 0.92; 95%
    CI, 0.90-0.94; *P* < .001; for male participants, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92-0.94; *P* < .001).
    Enhanced ME, marked by an increase of 5 curl-ups per minute, was associated with
    decreased risks of depression and ADHD in female participants, and lower anxiety
    and ADHD risks in male participants (aHR for ADHD risk for female participants,
    0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97; *P* < .001; for male participants, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97;
    *P* < .001). Improved MP, reflected by a 20-cm increase in jump distance, was
    associated with reduced risks of anxiety and ADHD in female participants and reduced
    anxiety, depression, and ADHD in male participants (aHR for ADHD risk for female
    participants, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00; *P* = .04; for male participants, 0.96;
    95% CI, 0.94-0.99; *P* = .001).'

    role of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, and muscular power in preventing
    the onset of mental disorders. It warrants further investigation of the effectiveness
    of physical fitness programs as a preventive measure for mental disorders among
    children and adolescents.'
