    intrinsic magnetic property—its spin—and its electric charge to improve electronic
    devices. Spintronics can make them more energy-efficient, faster to access data,
    or capable of storing huge amounts of information.

    it was his lab; not mine,” Parkin recalls.

    So he raided an equipment storage room filled with machinery IBM no longer used.
    Using an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, an ion pump, and a special flange—along with
    magnetron sputtering, an antiquated vacuum deposition method—he managed to build
    his own film deposition system. He could pump out 20 different multilayered structures
    daily to run experiments on thin films and materials.

    and make lots of discoveries,” he says. “In retrospect, losing the lab was a good

    system was faster and more effective.”
