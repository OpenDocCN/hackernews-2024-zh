# Computer-generated holography with ordinary display

> 来源：[https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-49-8-1876](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-49-8-1876)

## Abstract

We propose a method of computer-generated holography (CGH) using incoherent light emitted from a mobile phone screen. In this method, we suppose a cascade of holograms in which the first hologram is a color image displayed on the mobile phone screen. The hologram cascade is synthesized by solving an inverse problem with respect to the propagation of incoherent light. We demonstrate a three-dimensional color image reproduction using a two-layered hologram cascade composed of an iPhone and a spatial light modulator.
