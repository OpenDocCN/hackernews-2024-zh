    Prior to this revolution, various commercial drones played critical roles, primarily
    for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Since 2014, the main means
    of defending against these drones has been electronic warfare (EW), in its many
    forms. The iterative, lethal dance between drones and EW has unfolded a rich technological

    in 2014, Ukrainian forces depended heavily on commercial off-the-shelf drones,

    Russia’s response involved deploying [military-grade EW systems](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fall-and-rise-of-russian-electronic-warfare)
    alongside law-enforcement tools like [Aeroscope](https://www.theverge.com/22985101/dji-aeroscope-ukraine-russia-drone-tracking),
    a product from DJI that allows instant identification and tracking of drones from
    their radio emissions. Aeroscope, while originally a standard tool used by law
    enforcement to detect and track illegal drone flights, soon revealed its military
    potential by pinpointing both the drone and its operator.
