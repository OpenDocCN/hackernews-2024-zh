    warfare, but the war in Ukraine is taking it to a new level. This improvisation
    is most conspicuous in the ceaselessly evolving struggle between weaponized drones
    and electronic warfare, a cornerstone of this war.

    began dramatically reshaping the landscape of the war in the summer of 2023\.
    Prior to this revolution, various commercial drones played critical roles, primarily
    for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Since 2014, the main means
    of defending against these drones has been electronic warfare (EW), in its many
    forms. The iterative, lethal dance between drones and EW has unfolded a rich technological
    tapestry, revealing insights into a likely future of warfare where EW and drones
    intertwine.

    in 2014, Ukrainian forces depended heavily on commercial off-the-shelf drones,
    such as models from [DJI](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-dji-phantom-drone),
    for reconnaissance and surveillance. These were not FPV drones, for the most part.
    Russia’s response involved deploying [military-grade EW systems](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-fall-and-rise-of-russian-electronic-warfare)
    alongside law-enforcement tools like [Aeroscope](https://www.theverge.com/22985101/dji-aeroscope-ukraine-russia-drone-tracking),
    a product from DJI that allows instant identification and tracking of drones from
    their radio emissions. Aeroscope, while originally a standard tool used by law
    enforcement to detect and track illegal drone flights, soon revealed its military
    potential by pinpointing both the drone and its operator.

    providing Russian artillery units with precise coordinates for their targets—namely,
    Ukrainian drone operators. To circumvent this vulnerability, groups of Ukrainian
    volunteers innovated. By updating the firmware of the DJI drones, they closed
    the backdoors that allowed the drones to be tracked by Aeroscope. Nevertheless,
    after the start of the conflict in Crimea, commercial, off-the-shelf drones were
    considered a last-resort asset used by volunteers to compensate for the lack of
    proper military systems. To be sure, the impact of civilian drones during this
    period was not comparable to what occurred after the February 2022 invasion.

    then, but they didn’t, because most Russian officers at the time had a dismissive
    view of the capabilities of civilian drones in a high-intensity conflict. That
    failure opened a window of opportunity that Ukrainian armed-forces units exploited
    aggressively. Military personnel, assisted by many volunteer technical specialists,
    gained a decisive intelligence advantage for their forces by quickly fielding
    fleets of hundreds of camera drones connected to simple yet effective battlefield-management
    systems. They soon began modifying commercial drones to attack, with grenade tosses
    and, ultimately, [“kamikaze”](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/ace-ukrainian-fpv-drone-pilot-darwin-shows-war-s-explosive-evolution/)
    operations. Besides the DJI models, one of the key drones was the R18, an octocopter
    developed by the Ukrainian company [Aerorozvidka](https://aerorozvidka.ngo/),
    capable of carrying three grenades or small bombs. As casualties mounted, Russian
    officers soon realized the extent of the threat posed by these drones.

    the drones’ radio links for control and video. This wasn’t too hard, given that
    DJI’s [OcuSync protocol](https://www.droneblog.com/dji-transmission-system/) was
    not designed to withstand dense jamming environments. So by April 2023, Ukrainian
    drone units had begun pivoting toward first-person-view (FPV) drones with modular
    construction, enabling rapid adaptation to, and evasion of, EW countermeasures.

    of the front lines, around August 2022\. Sluggish Russian offensives came at a
    high cost, with an increasing proportion of casualties caused directly or indirectly
    by drone operators. By this time, the Ukrainians were hacking commercial drones,
    such as DJI Mavics, to “anonymize” them, rendering Aeroscope useless. It was also
    at this time that the Russians began to adopt commercial drones and develop their
    own tactics, techniques, and procedures, leveraging their EW and artillery advantages
    while attempting to compensate for their delay in combat-drone usage.

- en: Throughout 2023, when the primary EW tactic employed was jamming, the DJI drones
    began to fall out of favor for attack roles. When the density of Russian jammer
    usage surpassed a certain threshold, DJI’s [OcuSync](https://store.dji.bg/en/blog/what-is-dji-ocusync-and-how-does-it-work)
    radio protocol, which controls a drone’s flight direction and video, could not
    cope with it. Being proprietary, OcuSync’s frequency band and power are not modifiable.
    A jammer can attack both the control and video signals, and the drone becomes
    unrecoverable most of the time. As a result, DJI drones have lately been used
    farther from the front lines and relegated mainly to roles in intelligence, surveillance,
    and reconnaissance. Meanwhile, the modular construction of FPVs allowed for rapid
    evolution to enhance their resilience against EW. The Ukraine war greatly boosted
    the world’s production of FPV drones; at this point there are thousands of FPV
    models and modifications.

    technology offers drone operators a brief window of several seconds to correct
    the drone’s path upon detecting interference, for example as a result of jamming,
    before signal loss. Additionally, drone manufacturers have access to more powerful
    video transmitters, up to 5 watts, which are more resistant to jamming. Furthermore,
    the 1.2-gigahertz frequency band is gaining popularity over the previously dominant
    5.8-GHz band due to its superior obstacle penetration and because fewer jammers
    are targeting that band.

    a drone’s visual feed can be intercepted by any receiver. So various mitigation
    strategies have been explored. These include adding encryption layers and using
    digital-control and video protocols such as [HDZero](https://www.hd-zero.com/),

    it is also modifiable via its software. It has been hacked in order to use frequency
    bands other than its original 868 to 915 megahertz. This adaptation produces serious
    headaches for EW operators, because they have to cover a much wider band. As of
    March 2024, Ukrainian drone operators are performing final tests on 433-MHz ELRS
    transmitter-receiver pairs, further challenging prevailing EW methods.

    One offshoot of this strategy is that more and more kamikaze drones are directed

    or jammers could handle even six months ago. With brute-force jamming, even if
    defenders are willing to accept high rates of damage inflicted on their own offensive
    drones, these previous EW systems are just not up to the task. So for now, at

    are being installed on tanks, armored personnel carriers, trucks, pickups, and
    even 4x4s. Although limited and unsophisticated, these systems contribute to drone-threat
    mitigation. In addition, a growing number of soldiers on the front line carry
    simple, commercial radio-frequency (RF) scanners with them. Configured to detect
    drones across various frequency bands, these devices, though far from perfect,
    have begun to save lives by providing precious additional seconds of warning before
    an imminent drone attack.

    commercial drones have proven so lethal and disruptive, drone operators have become
    high-priority targets. As a result, operators have had to reinvent camouflage
    techniques, while the hackers who drive the evolution of their drones are working
    on every modification of RF equipment that offers an advantage. Besides the frequency-band
    modification described above, hackers have developed and refined two-way, two-signal
    repeaters**for drones. Such systems are attached to another drone that hovers
    close to the operator and well above the ground, relaying signals to and from
    the attacking drone. Such repeaters more than double the practical range of drone
    communications, and thus the EW “cats” in this game have to search a much wider

    versions of these systems will be fielded. These home-on-jam capabilities will
