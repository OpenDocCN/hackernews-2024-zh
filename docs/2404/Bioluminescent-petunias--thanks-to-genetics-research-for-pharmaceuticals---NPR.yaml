    in molecular and chemical biology, using his work with bioluminescence to understand
    how molecules interacted with diseases. His work started as a graduate student
    when the team he was on inserted a firefly gene into a tobacco plant.

    at a garden nursery. But, when the lights are turned out, the petals slowly start
    lighting up with a greenish, white glow. The plant is always glowing, it's just
    our eyes that need to adjust to see the light. The newest buds are the brightest
    and punctuate the glowing flowers.

    explained, "The second gene takes the intermediate and turns it into the actual
    fuel for the bioluminescence. The third gene is what actually makes the light.
    And then the last gene takes the product from the light reaction and recycles
    it back to the starting point."'

    and nurseries in Europe and the U.S. The plant was never supposed to leave a closed

    to destroy the plants and seeds.
