## Browse content by index

*   **[Books and standalone entries](https://protesilaos.com/books/) ::** This index includes items that are central to my work. It covers essays and video presentations. The content is philosophical.

*   **[Coding blog](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/) ::** In this index I write and/or talk about free/libre software and related issues. It is my de facto blog for Emacs.

*   **[Comments on life](https://protesilaos.com/commentary/) ::** Here I post comments about general life issues. These typically are in response to an email I receive. The focus is on practical philosophy.

*   **[Interpretations and critiques](https://protesilaos.com/interpretations/) ::** In this section I blend the artistic with the philosophical, as I provide my interpretation of cultural works. The lessons to be learnt are philosophical and thus not limited to the art they reference.

*   **[Keyboards and ergonomics](https://protesilaos.com/keeb/) ::** In this section I write about keyboards, switches, caps, ergonomics, and related issues.

*   **[My poems](https://protesilaos.com/poems/) ::** My poetry is but an attempt to record feelings. All poems are written in one go. I do not tend to their aesthetic appeal, as that requires extra processing which detracts from my truth in the moment.

*   **[News and announcements](https://protesilaos.com/news/) ::** This is about topics that relate to this website, or my life in general like what I do around the hut.

*   **[Politics blog](https://protesilaos.com/politics/) ::** Analyses on current affairs and/or political theory. Many entries concern the European Union.

*   **[All publications](https://protesilaos.com/master/) ::** Unfiltered list with all entries posted on this website.
