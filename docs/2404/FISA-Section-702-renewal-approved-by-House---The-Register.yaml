    702 last week over concerns that it would continue to allow warrantless surveillance

- en: Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has long been contentious
    for its provisions which indirectly allow surveillance of US citizens without
    a warrant. That's why a group of Republican holdouts joined Democrats in the House
    this week to [block](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4585718-fisa-702-spy-powers-rule-vote/)
    a floor vote on the bill to reauthorize the measure.

    was that FISA Section 702 only technically authorizes the US to spy on foreigners
    overseas considered a threat, but if those foreigners communicate with US citizens,
    then those citizens'' electronic communications can also be used for intelligence
    gathering.'

    Biggs (R-AZ), failed to pass on a split vote of 212-212\. Which means US citizens

    will continue to be surveilled without a warrant. Additional amendments – included

    prevent it from lapsing on April 19 – later passed the House with bipartisan support
    despite all the clamoring to end warrantless surveillance. The Senate will now
    have to pass the bill before the April 19 expiration, giving the body all of this
    week to do so.
