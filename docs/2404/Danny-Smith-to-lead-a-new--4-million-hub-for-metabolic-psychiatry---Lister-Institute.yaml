- en: We’ve always known that weight gain for people with SMI like bipolar disorder,
    schizophrenia and severe depression is a big issue, and it’s not entirely explained
    by medication side effects. Diabetes runs in families where there’s SMI but we
    don’t know how the connection works. People with SMI die 15 years younger, mostly
    because of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We hope to investigate, in detail
    and from lots of different angles, the mechanisms of the associations between
    metabolic problems and the risk of SMI. Whatever we discover will help us to refine
    and develop new metabolic treatments for mental illness, which is a very novel
    idea. Our aim is to bring the right people together to do this in detail, and
    to drive forward the whole area of metabolic psychiatry.

    others in Cambridge, Cardiff, London and Sheffield. Although there’s quite a lot
    of activity in each hub, the idea is that the hubs will integrate with each other
    so that the platform becomes a large-scale effort to address mental illness research.

    attention as more common conditions like depression and anxiety. So, the MRC and
    UKRI were very keen that the focus was on understanding SMI, which has been relatively
    neglected.

    with grants in the last year – I have two big Wellcome Trust grants on bipolar
    disorder that started in the last few months, so this finds me leading three programme
    grants for the next five years, all at the same time. But they are well funded,
    and I have a lot of support. The hub comes with funding for a project manager
    who will manage all the administrative load, for example.

- en: That’s an interesting story. About three years ago, someone called Iain Campbell
    came to see me. He had been researching non-medication options for treating his
    bipolar disorder, and he had been putting on weight. There are case reports of
    a ketogenic diet being helpful for bipolar disorder, so he decided to try it.
    His story is that within three days, his depression lifted as he went into ketosis
    and he’d been well for about a year, just on the diet with no medication. He wanted
    to research this and had been to see lots of different psychiatrists and other
    people who mostly thought this was a very left-field, fringe idea. But I thought
    there might be something in it. Iain put a video on YouTube of his experience,
    and it was picked up by some philanthropists in California called the [Baszucki
    Group](https://baszuckigroup.com/who-we-are/). They funded a pilot study of the
    ketogenic diet in bipolar disorder in Edinburgh with some interesting early results.
    There’s [an excellent summary of the whole area published on NPR.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/27/1227062470/keto-ketogenic-diet-mental-illness-bipolar-depression).
    We employed Iain, who has a PhD, to do that study, so it was extremely fortuitous.
    And it’s kind of grown arms and legs since then.

- en: We have different work streams pursuing different areas. One looks at the genetic
    overlap between things like diabetes and severe mental illness. Those studies
    can look at the direction of causality – is it about metabolic disease causing
    mental illness? Or is it mental illness causing metabolic problems, and is there
    a vicious circle? Then there’s a health informatics workstream, which looks at
    large-scale data in the NHS and other places to try and answer some of those questions.

- en: The workstream I’m more involved with is deep phenotyping, where we make repeated
    assessments of people’s metabolic status and mental health status, collecting
    lots of data over many time points. We can then look at whether there’s a pattern,
    such as their metabolic health becoming less good and triggering a relapse into
    mania, depression or psychosis. We can use machine learning approaches on that
    data to predict, on an individual patient basis, when they might be becoming unwell
    because of what’s going on in their metabolic state. Do any metabolic tests predict
    their mental relapse further down the line? So, it’s a combination of things.
    There are quite a lot of different aspects to it.

    be employed to lead the lived experience input into the hub. There are various
    aspects to what people with lived experience will be helping us with, including
    the design of the assessments, data collection, and helping us look at the data.
    Also developing knowledge exchange activities and dissemination activities to
    get the information about what we discover out to the right people, to try and
    influence policy and that kind of thing. We have the LEAP (lived experience advisory
    panel), which is six people with a history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,
    who we’ll meet with regularly to keep them abreast of the activity of the hub
    and to get their input on what directions we should be going in. So yes, it’s
    a core part of the work.
