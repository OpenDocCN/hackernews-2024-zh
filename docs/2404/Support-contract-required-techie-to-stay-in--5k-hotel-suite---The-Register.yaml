  zh: On Call 欢迎再次来到On-Call，《The Register》每周都会分享读者们在各种奇怪情况下被要求提供技术支持的回忆，大多数情况下都是困难的。但并非总是如此。
- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Frank" who once worked for a vendor
    of high-end, mission-critical storage arrays – the sort of stuff that's so important
    customers pay millions a year for support contracts that guarantee storage ninjas
    will parachute in to fix problems ASAP.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 本周，让我们认识一位读者，我们将称之为“Frank”，他曾为高端、任务关键的存储阵列供应商工作 —— 这种产品对客户来说如此重要，他们每年支付数百万美元的支持合同，保证存储忍者将会空降以快速解决问题。
- en: A few years back, Frank was in the office on a Friday morning when one of those
    support contracts was activated, and an email landed asking if anyone could get
    on a plane to visit a client ASAP.
  id: totrans-split-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 几年前的一个星期五早晨，Frank在办公室时，其中一份支持合同被激活，并收到一封电子邮件询问是否有人可以立即乘飞机访问客户。
- en: At the time, Frank was not a designated storage support ninja – so he ignored
    the request.
  id: totrans-split-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当时，Frank并不是指定的存储支持忍者，因此他忽略了这个请求。
- en: 'But an hour later another email landed: Frank''s employer was offering a bonus
    to whoever took the job.'
  id: totrans-split-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一个小时后，又收到一封电子邮件：Frank的雇主提供了一个接受这份工作的奖金。
- en: With nothing planned for the weekend, and confidence he could do a decent job
    as a storage ninja, Frank agreed to do it.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 周末没有安排什么事情，而且他有信心可以像一个存储忍者一样干一番体面的工作，所以Frank同意了。
- en: He quickly found himself on a plane bound for a significant European city, where
    the Department of Justice operated a storage array.
  id: totrans-split-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 他很快就坐上了飞往一座重要欧洲城市的飞机，那里司法部操作着一个存储阵列。
- en: The job had something to do with a disk failure that had inconveniently struck
    mere days before a local court was due to hand down its decision in a case so
    significant that Frank said "half of Europe's media had descended on the city
    to wait for the verdict."
  id: totrans-split-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这项工作与磁盘故障有关，不巧地在当地法院即将就一起重大案件作出裁决的几天前发生，以至于Frank说：“半个欧洲的媒体都涌入这座城市等待判决结果。”
- en: While the disk failure was a minor matter, the Justice Department's tech team
    had panicked. Frank's employer told them not to touch a thing. And when he arrived,
    Frank received the same instruction – plus orders to ensure he was available on
    immediate standby in case of further problems.
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 尽管磁盘故障只是一个小问题，但司法部的技术团队却陷入了恐慌。Frank的雇主告诉他们不要动任何东西。当Frank到达时，他也收到了同样的指示 —— 还有命令确保他随时待命以应对进一步的问题。
- en: That meant finding a hotel to crash in for the weekend.
  id: totrans-split-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这意味着他需要找一个周末可以住的酒店。
- en: Remember that waiting horde of media? They'd booked all the hotels in town.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 还记得等待的媒体群体吗？他们订满了城里所有的酒店。
- en: Frank could not find a room out in the burbs, nor beyond. But the client was
    having none of that. They wanted him within short strolling distance of the array
    in case its issues threatened to derail justice.
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Frank找不到房间在市区以外或更远的地方，但客户不接受这种情况。他们要求他在距离存储阵列步行距离的地方待命，以防其问题威胁到司法裁决的进行。
- en: 'A call to his employer''s corporate travel team yielded news that one room
    meeting the terms of the support contract remained available: a deluxe suite in
    a top global hotel chain.'
  id: totrans-split-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 通过联系雇主的企业旅行团队，得知仍有一间符合支持合同条款的客房可供选择：一个全球顶级酒店连锁的豪华套房。
- en: Frank looked up the price on the hotel's web site.
  id: totrans-split-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Frank查看了酒店网站上的价格。
- en: '"It cost over $5,000 per night," he told On Call, confessing "I''d never seen
    anything quite like it." And he hasn''t since.'
  id: totrans-split-20

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “每晚的费用超过5000美元，”他告诉On Call，承认“我从未见过类似的情况。”自那以后也没有再见过。
- en: One of the gold-framed mirrors alone was "close to the size of my room in the
    shared house I lived in back home."
  id: totrans-split-21

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其中一个镶金边的镜子就“接近我在家里合租的房间大小”。
- en: The room service menu was splendid. So was the 12-seat dining table at which
    he could consume whatever he summoned.
  id: totrans-split-22

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 客房服务菜单非常丰富。他还可以在一个可以容纳12人的餐桌上享用任何他点的东西。
- en: Lest you think Frank was wallowing in lazy luxury, the suite also had a separate
    office "with an enormous wooden desk."
  id: totrans-split-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 为了避免误解，Frank并不是在享受奢华，这套房还配备了一个独立办公室，“里面有一张巨大的木制办公桌。”
- en: Frank got to spend the whole weekend in that suite and quite enjoyed it – even
    if he was never able to fully indulge himself, given the client was paying him
    to spring into storage ninja mode.
  id: totrans-split-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Frank 得以在套房里度过整个周末，他相当喜欢这段时光 — 即使他从未能完全放松，因为客户付钱让他进入存储忍者模式。
- en: And then the dream of hanging around in five star luxury doing nothing died.
    The court handed down its decision on Monday, fixing the array took five whole
    minutes, and Frank was on a plane home and back at his very non-luxurious desk
    by Tuesday.
  id: totrans-split-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后，在五星级豪华酒店里无所事事的梦想破灭了。法院在周一作出了裁决，修复整个数组花了五分钟，Frank 在周二就乘飞机回家了，并回到了他那非常不豪华的办公桌前。
- en: When he arrived, he gained two things.

    IT pro coming out ahead after a tech support incident. If you have had a similarly
    pleasant time while on a job, [click here to send On Call an email](mailto:oncall@theregister.com)
