- en: On Call Welcome once again to On-Call, *The Register*’s weekly wander through
    readers’ recollections of being asked to perform tech support under all sorts
    of strange circumstances, most of them difficult. But not always.

- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Frank" who once worked for a vendor
    of high-end, mission-critical storage arrays – the sort of stuff that's so important
    customers pay millions a year for support contracts that guarantee storage ninjas
    will parachute in to fix problems ASAP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few years back, Frank was in the office on a Friday morning when one of those
    support contracts was activated, and an email landed asking if anyone could get
    on a plane to visit a client ASAP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the time, Frank was not a designated storage support ninja – so he ignored
    the request.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But an hour later another email landed: Frank''s employer was offering a bonus
    to whoever took the job.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With nothing planned for the weekend, and confidence he could do a decent job
    as a storage ninja, Frank agreed to do it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He quickly found himself on a plane bound for a significant European city, where
    the Department of Justice operated a storage array.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The job had something to do with a disk failure that had inconveniently struck
    mere days before a local court was due to hand down its decision in a case so
    significant that Frank said "half of Europe's media had descended on the city
    to wait for the verdict."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the disk failure was a minor matter, the Justice Department's tech team
    had panicked. Frank's employer told them not to touch a thing. And when he arrived,
    Frank received the same instruction – plus orders to ensure he was available on
    immediate standby in case of further problems.

- en: That meant finding a hotel to crash in for the weekend.
  prefs: []

- en: Remember that waiting horde of media? They'd booked all the hotels in town.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank could not find a room out in the burbs, nor beyond. But the client was
    having none of that. They wanted him within short strolling distance of the array
    in case its issues threatened to derail justice.

- en: 'A call to his employer''s corporate travel team yielded news that one room
    meeting the terms of the support contract remained available: a deluxe suite in
    a top global hotel chain.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank looked up the price on the hotel's web site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"It cost over $5,000 per night," he told On Call, confessing "I''d never seen
    anything quite like it." And he hasn''t since.'

    shared house I lived in back home."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The room service menu was splendid. So was the 12-seat dining table at which
    he could consume whatever he summoned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lest you think Frank was wallowing in lazy luxury, the suite also had a separate
    office "with an enormous wooden desk."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank got to spend the whole weekend in that suite and quite enjoyed it – even
    if he was never able to fully indulge himself, given the client was paying him
    to spring into storage ninja mode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the dream of hanging around in five star luxury doing nothing died.
    The court handed down its decision on Monday, fixing the array took five whole
    minutes, and Frank was on a plane home and back at his very non-luxurious desk
    by Tuesday.

    IT pro coming out ahead after a tech support incident. If you have had a similarly
    pleasant time while on a job, [click here to send On Call an email](mailto:oncall@theregister.com)
    and we may celebrate your success on a future Friday. ®
