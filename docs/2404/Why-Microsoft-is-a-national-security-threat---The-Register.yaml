- en: Interview Microsoft has a shocking level of control over IT within the US federal
    government – so much so that former senior White House cyber policy director AJ
    Grotto thinks it's fair to call Redmond's recent security failures a national
    security issue.

- en: Grotto this week spoke with *The Register* in an interview you can watch below,
    in which he told us that exacting even slight concessions from Microsoft has been
    a major fight for the Feds.

    from a few years ago … [Microsoft] was essentially up-selling logging capability
    to federal agencies" instead of making it the default, Grotto said. "As a result,
    it was really hard for agencies to identify their exposure to the SolarWinds breach."'

- en: Grotto told us Microsoft had to be "dragged kicking and screaming" to provide
    logging capabilities to the government by default, and given the fact the mega-corp
    banked around $20 billion in revenue from security services last year, the concession
    was minimal at best.

    and they're not afraid to use it."

    by Russian cyber operatives, both of which allowed spies to gain access to US
    government emails, and Grotto says it's fair to classify Microsoft and its products
    as a national security concern.

    Grotto said. He believes it also needs to publicly scrutinize Microsoft and make
    sure everyone knows when it messes up.'

    to market incentives," Grotto told us. "Unless this scrutiny generates changed
    behavior among its customers who might want to look elsewhere, then the incentives
    for Microsoft to change are not going to be as strong as they should be." ®'
