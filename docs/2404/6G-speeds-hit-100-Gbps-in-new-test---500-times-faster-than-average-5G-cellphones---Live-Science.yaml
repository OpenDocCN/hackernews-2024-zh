- en: A consortium of companies in Japan has built the world's first high-speed 6G
    wireless device, capable of transmitting data at blistering speeds of 100 gigabits
    per second (Gbps) at more than 300 feet (90 meters) — up to 20 times faster than
    5G.

    per second, and, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/818204/4g-3g-and-overall-download-speed-in-the-united-states-by-provider/#:~:text=5G%20and%20overall%20mobile%20download%20speed%20in%20the%20U.S.%202024%2C%20by%20provider&text=As%20of%20late%202023%2C%20T,download%20speed%20at%2097.1%20Mbps.),
    up to 500 times faster than average 5G T-Mobile speeds in the U.S.

    show that the consortium’s wireless device transmitted data at 100 Gbps indoors
    over the 100 gigahertz (GHz) band and outdoors in the 300 GHz band — which sits
    below infrared in the electromagnetic spectrum. The tests were conducted over
    328 feet (100 meters), consortium representatives said in the statement.

    standard and is used by almost all new smartphones, for example. Average T-Mobile
    speeds in the U.S. are approximately 204.9 megabits per second (Mbps), while the
    theoretical maximum 5G speed is [at least 10 Gbps](https://5g.co.uk/guides/how-fast-is-5g/).

    standard, 6G, with the infrastructure in the works ahead of rollout by the early
    2030s, according to the GSM Association ([GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/spectrum/setting-the-stage-for-6g/#:~:text=6G%20is%20expected%20to%20become,experience%20compared%20to%20previous%20generations.))

    spectrum](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html) in which they
    operate. Operating in higher bands generally means much higher speeds.

    of around 40 GHz — known as the "millimeter-wave bands," according to [6GWorld](https://www.6gworld.com/exclusives/6g-spectrum/#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%205G,frequencies%20in%20the%20terahertz%20range.).

    bands, which are between 100 GHz and 300 GHz, according to [Nokia](https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=320011&a=2384895&epi=livescience-us-1439657336584167234&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fabout-us%2Fnewsroom%2Farticles%2Fspectrum-for-6G-explained%2F).
    Transmitting in this region taps into the advantage of faster speeds but has the
    disadvantage of greater interference with the environment, with signals more likely
    to become blocked — particularly indoors.

    consumption, the jump from 5G to 6G could lead to new technologies like holographic
    communication and smoother virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality experiences.

    new infrastructure to transmit and amplify signals, while smartphones or VR devices
    would require 6G antennae.

- en: In previous tests, scientists have achieved faster 6G speeds — but over much
    shorter distances. A different team of scientists in Japan, for example, demonstrated
    world-record 6G speeds of up to 240 Gbps but only at 66 feet (20 m), publishing
    their findings Feb. 10 in the journal [IEICE Electronics Express](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/elex/21/3/21_20.20230584/_article).
