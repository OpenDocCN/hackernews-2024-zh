- en: An analysis by University of Michigan researchers of more than 30 million grading
    records from U-M finds students with alphabetically lower-ranked names receive
    lower grades. This is due to sequential grading biases and the default order of
    students’ submissions in Canvas — the most widely used online learning management
    system — which is based on alphabetical rank of their surnames.

    receive comments that are notably more negative and less polite, and exhibit lower
    grading quality measured by post-grade complaints from students.

    but even for me it was really surprising,” said Jun Li, associate professor of
    technology and operations at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. “It didn’t
    occur to us until we looked at the data and realized that sequence makes a difference.”

    and assignments on Canvas from the fall 2014 semester to the summer 2022 semester.
    They supplemented the Canvas data with university registrar data, which contains
    detailed information about students’ backgrounds, demographics and learning trajectories
    at the university.

    across institutions and courses. They are driven by a common design issue of learning-management
    systems — the default setting of ranking students’ assignments alphabetically
    by their names.

    graders evaluate more assignments. Wang said students whose surnames start with
    A, B, C, D or E received a 0.3-point higher grade out of 100 possible points than
    compared with when they were graded randomly. Likewise, students with later-in-the-alphabet
    surnames received a 0.3-point lower grade — creating a 0.6-point gap.

    A, the grade gap flips as expected: A-E students are worse off, while W-Z students
    receive higher grades relative to what they would receive when graded randomly.
    The researchers said such observations confirm their hypothesis that it’s the
    order of grading that leads to the initial gap in grades.'

    course grade-point averages, which negatively influences opportunities in their
    respective career paths.

    in which they were talking about their research: Wang studies educational technology
    and he studies artificial intelligence. He observed that a fundamental task of
    machine learning is data labeling, also a sequential task that can be long and
    tedious, but one that is randomized.'

    studies to see if there was any disparity among grades based on the amount of
    time spent in the task of grading.

    this effect, because when you’re working on something for a long period of time,
    you get tired and then you start to lose your attention and your cognitive abilities
    are dropping,” Pei said.

    order, and some educators do, but alphabetical order is the default mode in Canvas
    and other online learning-management systems. One simple fix would be to make
    random order the default setting.

    distribute the workload among more people or train them to be aware of and lessen
