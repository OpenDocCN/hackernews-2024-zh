# Inside System/360 - CHM Revolution

###### The Software

System/360’s software was also ambitious. Variations of one operating system, OS/360, were supposed to run on all the models.

But OS/360 was hard to write -- especially the complex “multiprogramming” versions that ran several programs at once -- and it was late. Three special OSs had to be created for the smallest machines.

###### The Hardware

In addition to the underlying principle of compatibility, System/360 incorporated many hardware advances, including options for very large main memories and Solid Logic Technology (hybrid integrated circuits).

It also used microprogramming, software that implemented some complicated instructions that would otherwise need special hardware – key to making the smaller models do everything.
