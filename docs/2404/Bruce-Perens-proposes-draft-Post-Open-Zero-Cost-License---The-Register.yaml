    He's been [working on it](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/27/bruce_perens_post_open/)

    software in a paid-for product would be required to pay 1 percent of their revenue
    back to this administrative organization, which would distribute the funds to

    in which the overburdened maintainer of the XZ suite of compression tools was
    pressured to allow a pseudonymous contributor, assumed to be part of a nation-state
    hacking effort, to install backdoor code that was detected only by chance.

    capable of creating the XZ software, but not of supporting all of the world''s
    richest corporations for exactly nothing for the rest of his life. And so we have
    to pay those developers both to support the companies that use the software and
    to provide some balance to a situation that''s become very unbalanced."'
