On April 19, 1824, Lord Byron died at Missolonghi, where he had gone to lend his name and give financial support to the Greek war for independence from the Ottoman Empire. After being drenched by a sudden rainstorm while out riding, the poet developed a fever, from which he might well have recovered had it not been for some disastrous medical treatment, chiefly bleeding with leeches that left him weak and dehydrated. He was just 36.
