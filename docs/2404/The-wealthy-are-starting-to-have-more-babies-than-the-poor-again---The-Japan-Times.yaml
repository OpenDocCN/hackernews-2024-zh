- en: This relationship between positive status and offspring seems to have reached
    its peak with despotic rulers such as reputed father-of-thousands Genghis Khan
    — a 2003 genetic study found that one out of every 200 men worldwide may carry
    his Y chromosome. For women, that level of fecundity was of course impossible,
    and overall their status-offspring link was weaker, but in general people with
    more resources had more children.

    forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and the revolutions in living standards
    and life expectancy that followed, birth rates fell. Within these increasingly
    wealthy countries, it was the affluent and educated — with education becoming
    a key marker of status — who led the way in reducing family size.
