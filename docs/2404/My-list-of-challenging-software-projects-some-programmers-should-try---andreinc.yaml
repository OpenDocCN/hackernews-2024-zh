    are mainly intended for those who are interested in exploring new areas of knowledge.
    However, it’s important to note that most of these ideas may not be relevant to
    today’s job market. If you’re looking to add something impressive to your portfolio
    for recruitment purposes, it might be worth considering other options. For example,
    instead of building yet another TODO app in React (75k repos on GitHub), you might
    want to focus on back-end or front-end development by cloning a well-known site.
    Such projects are likely to be more beneficial in terms of knowledge gained and
    job perspectives.

    beyond the traditional job market. For these individuals, programming is more
    of a hobby than a means of earning a living. If you fall into this category, you
    may find the following project suggestions more appealing.

    or [Colossal Cave](https://rickadams.org/adventure/advent/) were extremely popular.
