    search results, and could possibly impact Google Ngram viewer, an important tool
    used by researchers to track language use throughout history.

- en: I was able to find the AI-generated books with the same method we’ve previously
    used to find AI-generated [Amazon product reviews](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d9bvn/ai-spam-is-already-flooding-the-internet-and-it-has-an-obvious-tell?ref=404media.co),
    papers published in [academic journals](https://www.404media.co/scientific-journals-are-publishing-papers-with-ai-generated-text/),
    and online [articles](https://www.404media.co/google-search-really-has-gotten-worse-researchers-find/).
    Searching Google Books for the term “As of my last knowledge update,” which is
    associated with ChatGPT-generated answers, returns dozens of books that include
    that phrase. Some of the books are about ChatGPT, machine learning, AI, and other
    related subjects and include the phrase because they are discussing ChatGPT and
    its outputs. These books appear to be written by humans. However, most of the
    books in the first eight pages of results turned up by the search appear to be
    AI-generated and are not about AI.
