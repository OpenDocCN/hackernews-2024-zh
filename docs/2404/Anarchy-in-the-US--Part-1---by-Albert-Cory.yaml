    work and everything furnished by the company, for each industry at Pullman stands
    on its own feet, and keeps its own separate account. The company's brick yards
    charge the company a profit on the brick the latter buys, and the other establishments

    about Chicago which pay no more, and Pullman claims to pay only ordinary wages.
    Many of the mechanics earn &2 50 or $2 75 a day, some $3 and $4, and occasionally
    even more. Those who receive but $1.30 have a hard struggle to live, after the
    rent and water tax are paid. On this point there is unanimity of sentiment, and
    Pullman does comparatively little for them, and the social problem in their case
    remains unsolved. They are crowded together in the cheap flats, which are put

- en: SLEEPING CARS TO BE TIED UP—RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE NOT CONSIDERED. After several
    days of deliberation the new railroad organization called the American Railway
    Union has decided to ask the railroad employes of the country to refuse to handle
    Pullman sleeping cars, or to allow them to be attached to passenger trains. The
    object is to bring additional pressure to bear on the Pullman company to force
    it to pay higher wages to employes who quit work and surrendered their situations
    a couple of months ago because they did not think they were getting enough pay,
    they demanding the same number of dollars as received last year when money had
    less purchasing power. Week before last, when some of the old employes at Pullman
    appeared before the ARU convention and described their unhappy situation, many
    delegates got excited and clamored for an immediate boycott. But no one got excited
    over the prospect of forcing people who for thirty years have been accustomed
    to use sleeping cars suddenly to do without them. No one in that convention suggested
    timidly that hundreds of thousands of people would be inconvenienced seriously—not
    to use a stronger phrase—by the sudden stoppage of sleeping cars throughout the
    West or Union. The whole traveling public, and not merely those who use sleepers,
    will have the screws put on them, though they are in no way parties to the dispute.
    The head of the Railway Union announces that if injunctions are served on them
    by any railroad we will immediately tie up the entire railway system. I should
    not be surprised if this boycott would bring about a general railroad strike.
    If it does we shall come out of it with every railway employe in the country in
    our ranks and with every grievance adjusted. This is a good time to do it. So
    if the railway companies refuse to break contracts they have made for the hauling
    of sleeping ears, or if courts attempt to intervene to protect the public, travel
    throughout the Union must cease for this season of the year. The serenity with
    which the head of a railway labor organization contemplates the possible distress
    and unhappiness of millions of the American people is cynical and revolting. This
    utter indifference to the rights and comfort of the public or of innocent third
    parties who have nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with one of these conflicts
    between capital and labor on a dispute about wages shows a lack of humanity on
    the part of the proposed boycotters. one would imagine that the American Railway
    Union, at the same time that it was determining to injure the innocent traveling
    public, would apologize to those who use sleeping cars and express profound regret
    that the steps to be taken against the company would seriously interfere with
    their comfort and health. But there has been nothing said as yet to show that
    the union cares a fig whether the masses of the people are incommoded and harmed
    or not, provided Pullman can be hurt. Perhaps it is natural that men who are out
    on a strike should forget the rights of third parties. They are in the heat of
    a personal contest, a sort of civil war, and they think of nothing else. But while
    these Pullman strikers joined the American Railway Union at the time they struck
    the other members of that organization cannot have such an overwhelming interest
    in that controversy as to be forgetful utterly of the fact that a stoppage of
    the running of several thousand sleepers in the United States is a direct attack
    on multitudes of innocent individuals. Are the unquestioned rights of the many
    to be assailed to protect the alleged rights of a few? Where does the American
    Railway Union find a legal or equitable argument fur that? Is there no other way
    of settling the dispute about wages these hard times?

  zh: SLEEPING CARS TO BE TIED UP—RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE NOT CONSIDERED. 经过数天的研究后，名为美国铁路工会的新铁路组织决定请求全国铁路雇员拒绝处理普尔曼卧铺车，或允许它们附着于客运列车。其目的是对普尔曼公司施加额外压力，迫使其支付更高工资给那些几个月前因为认为工资不足而辞职并放弃工作的员工，他们要求与去年相同数量的美元，尽管当时货币购买力较弱。上周前，当一些普尔曼的老员工出现在ARU大会上并描述他们的不幸情况时，许多代表们都变得激动起来，并呼吁立即进行抵制。但没有人因突然停止使用卧铺车而感到激动。在那次大会上，没有人胆怯地建议，突然停止在西部或联合国使用卧铺车将严重影响数十万人的便利性。整个旅行大众，而不仅仅是使用卧铺车的人，都将受到压力，尽管他们在这场争议中无论如何都不是一方。铁路工会的负责人宣布，如果任何铁路公司对他们提出禁令，我们将立即停运整个铁路系统。如果这次抵制行动引发全面铁路罢工，我不会感到惊讶。如果真的如此，我们将使全国每一个铁路雇员加入我们的行列，并解决每一个不满。现在是时候这样做了。所以，如果铁路公司拒绝违约他们为运输卧铺车所做的合同，或者法院试图干预以保护公众，那么本季旅行必须停止。一个铁路劳工组织的领导对可能导致数百万美国人苦恼和不快的可能情况持有的从容态度是冷嘲热讽和令人反感的。对公众的权利和舒适，或者对与资本和劳工之间的关于工资争议无论直接还是间接有关的无辜第三方的无视，显示出了拟议抵制者的人道主义缺失。人们可能会想象，在决定伤害无辜的旅行大众的同时，美国铁路工会会向使用卧铺车的人道歉，并深表遗憾地表示，采取针对公司的行动将严重影响他们的舒适和健康。但至今没有任何言论表明该工会是否在乎大多数人是否被不便和伤害，只要普尔曼受到伤害就行了。也许罢工中的人们忘记了第三方的权利是很自然的。他们处于一场个人竞争的热情当中，一种内部战争，并且他们除此之外什么都不想。但是，虽然这些普尔曼罢工者加入了美国铁路工会，但在他们罢工的同时，该组织的其他成员不可能如此专注于那场争议，以至于完全忘记了在美国停运数千辆卧铺车直接攻击了无数无辜个人的事实。难道多数人的不可争议的权利会被攻击来保护少数人的所谓权利吗？美国铁路工会在哪里找到了合法或公平的论据？难道这些艰难时期没有其他解决工资争议的办法吗？
