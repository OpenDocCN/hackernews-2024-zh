    millions of dollars. The rents of the dwellings vary from $4 50 per month for
    the cheapest flats of two rooms to $100 a month for the largest private house
    in the place. The rent usually paid varies from $14 to $25 a month, exclusive
    of the water charge, which is generally not far from eighty cents. A five-roomed
    cottage, such as is seen in the illustration, rents for $17 a month, and its cost
    is estimated at $1700, including a charge of $300 for the lot. But it must be
    understood that the estimated value of $1700 includes profits on brick and carpenter
    work and everything furnished by the company, for each industry at Pullman stands
    on its own feet, and keeps its own separate account. The company's brick yards
    charge the company a profit on the brick the latter buys, and the other establishments
    do the same ; consequently the estimated cost of the buildings includes profits
    which flowed after all into the company’s coffers.

    score which appeared to be well founded. Unskilled laborers—and they are perhaps
    one-fourth of the population—receive only $1 30 a day; but there are other corporations
    about Chicago which pay no more, and Pullman claims to pay only ordinary wages.
    Many of the mechanics earn &2 50 or $2 75 a day, some $3 and $4, and occasionally
    even more. Those who receive but $1.30 have a hard struggle to live, after the
    rent and water tax are paid. On this point there is unanimity of sentiment, and
    Pullman does comparatively little for them, and the social problem in their case
    remains unsolved. They are crowded together in the cheap flats, which are put
    as much out of sight as possible, and present a rather dreary appearance, although
    vastly better than the poorer class of New York tenements.

- en: SLEEPING CARS TO BE TIED UP—RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE NOT CONSIDERED. After several
    days of deliberation the new railroad organization called the American Railway
    Union has decided to ask the railroad employes of the country to refuse to handle
    Pullman sleeping cars, or to allow them to be attached to passenger trains. The
    object is to bring additional pressure to bear on the Pullman company to force
    it to pay higher wages to employes who quit work and surrendered their situations
    a couple of months ago because they did not think they were getting enough pay,
    they demanding the same number of dollars as received last year when money had
    less purchasing power. Week before last, when some of the old employes at Pullman
    appeared before the ARU convention and described their unhappy situation, many
    delegates got excited and clamored for an immediate boycott. But no one got excited
    over the prospect of forcing people who for thirty years have been accustomed
    to use sleeping cars suddenly to do without them. No one in that convention suggested
    timidly that hundreds of thousands of people would be inconvenienced seriously—not
    to use a stronger phrase—by the sudden stoppage of sleeping cars throughout the
    West or Union. The whole traveling public, and not merely those who use sleepers,
    will have the screws put on them, though they are in no way parties to the dispute.
    The head of the Railway Union announces that if injunctions are served on them
    by any railroad we will immediately tie up the entire railway system. I should
    not be surprised if this boycott would bring about a general railroad strike.
    If it does we shall come out of it with every railway employe in the country in
    our ranks and with every grievance adjusted. This is a good time to do it. So
    if the railway companies refuse to break contracts they have made for the hauling
    of sleeping ears, or if courts attempt to intervene to protect the public, travel
    throughout the Union must cease for this season of the year. The serenity with
    which the head of a railway labor organization contemplates the possible distress
    and unhappiness of millions of the American people is cynical and revolting. This
    utter indifference to the rights and comfort of the public or of innocent third
    parties who have nothing to do, directly or indirectly, with one of these conflicts
    between capital and labor on a dispute about wages shows a lack of humanity on
    the part of the proposed boycotters. one would imagine that the American Railway
    Union, at the same time that it was determining to injure the innocent traveling
    public, would apologize to those who use sleeping cars and express profound regret
    that the steps to be taken against the company would seriously interfere with
    their comfort and health. But there has been nothing said as yet to show that
    the union cares a fig whether the masses of the people are incommoded and harmed
    or not, provided Pullman can be hurt. Perhaps it is natural that men who are out
    on a strike should forget the rights of third parties. They are in the heat of
    a personal contest, a sort of civil war, and they think of nothing else. But while
    these Pullman strikers joined the American Railway Union at the time they struck
    the other members of that organization cannot have such an overwhelming interest
    in that controversy as to be forgetful utterly of the fact that a stoppage of
    the running of several thousand sleepers in the United States is a direct attack
    on multitudes of innocent individuals. Are the unquestioned rights of the many
    to be assailed to protect the alleged rights of a few? Where does the American
    Railway Union find a legal or equitable argument fur that? Is there no other way
    of settling the dispute about wages these hard times?

- en: Meanwhile the force of police was being rapidly increased by detachments from
    neighboring stations, and by 10 o’clock was strong enough to keep the mob back.
    Frank G. Hackett, the gate tender at Grand Crossing, was persuaded by Pullman
    strikers and members of the American Railway Union to leave his position. There
    was no one else who had authority to open and shut the gates. Hackett left his
    post at 7 o'clock, just as a suburban train from the north approached the crossing
    and whistled for the gates to open. There was no response from the gateman and
    the train was compelled to stand there. Then every few minutes another train came
    to a standstill. The switchmen also refused to turn the switches to allow the
    embargoed trains to pass.

    the scene and 200 in reserve and was prepared to suppress any disturbance that
    might arise. A switchman on the ground said that all of his craft from Burnside
    to Lake street had struck—125 men in all. Engineers and other employés said they
    had no connection with the strike, that it was confined solely to switchmen.

- en: '*As I understand it, said Mr. Watts, "an irresponsible mob gathered around
    our gatemen who throw the signals at the intersection of the Illinois Central
    and Fort Wayne tracks and either forced or coaxed them to quit work. Of course
    this left the crossings unprotected and trains could not pass. The men who caused
    this are not members of the American Railway Union unless they were Pullman strikers.
    Few of our men are connected with the organization. Train No.9, a fast express
    containing a United States mail car, due at the Union Depot at 9 p. m., was held
    up twenty-five minutes. Train No. 66, a freight, bound east, was held up for two
    hours. Finally our station agents threw the signals. This released the trains
    at once.'

- en: ‘If the responsibility for this trouble at Grand Crossing can be located the
    government is likely to take a hand in the fight. The stopping of the mail train
    is a serious offense, and an investigation will be demanded. I am confident, however,
    that the Pennsylvania system will suffer very little by the boycott. We have many
    Pullman cars and are determined to operate them, American Railway Union or no
    American Railway Union. I have been all over my division and know how the men
    feel. They are not in sympathy with the movement. We are so confident of the outcome
    that the Pennsylvania road bas not considered special defensive measures. We believe
    the regularly delegated authorities are equal to the emergency. There may be hitches
    for a few days, but that will be all. We have not had a particle of trouble in
    our yards and have every assurance that our switchmen will be loyal.”

    the gates being swung by some one of the strikers. As the Wagner cars passed by
    they were greeted by the crowd with shouts of: “Those are the cars to run. They''re
    all right,” and similar expressions. The passengers in the Pullman cars were advised
    by the crowd that they might as well decide to travel in a common coach, as no
    more Pullman cars would be allowed to pass Grand Crossing.'

    even though Debs and the union would have been more than happy to run trains with
    *only* mail cars and freight cars. The railroads insisted on including Pullman
    cars.)

    this drama, and *especially* how there are no "on the scene” photos. Nowadays,
    a news outlet would send out a camera crew along with their reporter. Back then,
    it hadn’t *quite* started yet. I think the exposure times for film were just too
    long, and cameras too big & expensive.
