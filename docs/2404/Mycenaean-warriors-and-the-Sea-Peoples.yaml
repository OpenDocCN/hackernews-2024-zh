- en: Recently, Jesper van den Berg posed two related questions on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/AWMagazine).
    The first was on the reconstruction of Mycenaean warriors in my book [*Henchmen
    of Ares*](https://www.henchmenofares.com/), which were specifically contrasted
    with reconstructions offered by [Andrea Salimbeti](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/index.htm).
    The second question concerned the so-called “Sea-Peoples”, known from Egyptian
    monuments, and whether or not these included Aegean warriors.

- en: The main problem regarding Aegean warriors concerns the use of metal armour
    and shields in the period prior to the fall of the Mycenaean palaces around 1200
    BC. Some people take the Homeric epics as historical documents that contain useful
    information about the period around 1200 BC and extrapolate from that. In the *Iliad*,
    warriors wear metal body-armour, greaves and helmets with “nodding crests”, and
    they invariably possess large shields.

- en: 'But do the Homeric epics reflect the world of the Mycenaean Bronze Age? There
    are undoubtedly elements that date back to that period, as I explain in *Henchmen
    of Ares*. A war between Greeks (Mycenaeans) in the north-west of Asia Minor is
    plausible, and there are some Hittite sources – again, referred to in the book
    – that show unrest in a region known as Wilusa, which can most probably be identified
    with the Greek Ilion (Troy). Even some of the political geography in Greece dates
    back to the Bronze Age: Mycenae was a small town in the Archaic and Classical
    periods, so the kingdom of Agamemnon must have been something passed on orally
    from one generation to the next.'

- en: As always, however, the devil is in the details. When we look at the actual
    social structure, we find little that is very similar to the bureaucratic structures
    of the Mycenaean kingdoms. The palaces of the kings look more like large farmhouses.
    Odysseus’ palace in Ithaca has geese waddling about and a dung heap near the entrance,
    where the hero’s old dog recognizes his disguised master before expiring. In no
    way does it resemble a Mycenaean palace. There are no archives, no scribes, no
    officials to deal with storage and the production of vast amounts of, for example,
    oil or wine. It resembles more closely the structures known archaeologically from
    the eighth and seventh centuries BC.

- en: Homer probably lived around 700 BC and it comes as no surprise that most of
    the physical artefacts and structures in his works resemble those of his own age,
    including the equipment of his heroes. Metal cuirasses are known from Argos as
    early as the late eighth century BC, and metal helmets were introduced around
    that time, too, perhaps from Assyria. The large shields in the Homeric epics all
    appear to be round and are quite compatible with shields known from Geometric
    and Archaic Greek pottery. Hans van Wees has even argued that some shields may,
    in fact, be Argive (hoplite) shields, with a double-grip. The presence of a “Mycenaean”
    boar’s-tusk helmet in the *Iliad* might be an heirloom or a find from a tomb that
    a farmer stumbled upon and that Homer saw at some point.**

- en: For the thirteenth century BC, we have no evidence at all of metal body-armour
    or shields. These are features of the earlier Mycenaean epoch – for example, the
    bronze lobster cuirass from a tomb at Dendra – or of the period after the fall
    of the Mycenaean palaces, especially the middle of the twelfth century BC. For
    the Mycenaean era itself, we have warriors in waisted tunics with spears, short
    swords, and boar’s-tusk helmets. They are never shown wearing metal armour or
    using shields. A fresco from Pylos that was once thought to depict a round shield
    was wrongly reconstructed. This is not to say that metal armour was not used at
    all, but simply that it doesn’t appear to have been as common as is often thought,
    and reconstructions showing Mycenaean warriors of ca. 1200 BC universally clad
    in bronze from head to toe and brandishing shields are probably wrong.

- en: As regards the “Sea-Peoples”, the designation derives from Egyptian sources.
    We know that Egypt suffered from attacks by these people, especially during the
    reign of Ramesses III (r. 1186–1155 BC). The entire eastern Mediterranean was
    suffering from instability around 1200 BC. In the first half of the twelfth century
    BC, several civilizations crumbled, including the Mycenaean palace civilization
    and the Hittite Empire, and some city-states were destroyed, such as Ugarit in
    Syria. (See also [*Ancient Warfare* IV.4](https://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/cms/).)

- en: The Sea-Peoples are sometimes thought to have caused the downfall of the Mycenaean
    palaces. Certainly, human agency was involved, since many of the palaces show
    signs of burning. But whether the “Sea-Peoples” were responsible for all this,
    or just a symptom of more widespread unrest, is an open question. It is quite
    possible that various factors – natural disaster such as famine or epidemic, rebellions,
    political strife, and so on – conspired to create a situation in which some people
    decided to turn to the sea. Some scholars have suggested that the Mycenaeans later
    formed the “Sea-Peoples” or that part of them joined the “Sea-Peoples” on their
    trek through the eastern Mediterranean.

- en: Some of the names used to denote some groups by the Egyptians are suggestive
    of particular ethnonyms. The “Sherden”, for example, may be identified with peoples
    from Sardinia. There are some suggestive figurines – al dated to the ninth or
    eighth centuries BC in the conventional chronology – that are very similar to
    Egyptian depictions of these people. The “Meshwesh” were people from Libya. Most
    interestingly, the “Ekwesh” have been compared to the Achaeans (Greeks) from Homer,
    who may have been known to the Hittites, as recorded in documents recovered from
    the archives of their capital at Hattusa, as the “Ahhiyawa”. Similarly, the “Denyen”
    might be identified with the Danaans, another term used by Homer to denote the
    Greeks.

- en: What we have, then, is a lot of suggestive data. The Sea-Peoples were either
    a disruptive force in the eastern Mediterranean after ca. 1200 BC or a symptom
    of some other problem (or perhaps both). The Sea-Peoples included a variety of
    different people from different places, probably including Sardinia and Mycenaean
    Greece. The depictions of warriors on the walls of the mortuary temple of Ramesses
    III at Medinet Habu resemble particular peoples, like the Mycenaeans. As a result,
    it is possible to reconstruct some events in broad strokes, even if the exact
    causes of the unrest in the eastern Mediterranean remain mysterious (famine? plague?
    social unrest?), and many of the details are frustratingly vague.
