- en: Recently, Jesper van den Berg posed two related questions on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/AWMagazine).
    The first was on the reconstruction of Mycenaean warriors in my book [*Henchmen
    of Ares*](https://www.henchmenofares.com/), which were specifically contrasted
    with reconstructions offered by [Andrea Salimbeti](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/index.htm).
    The second question concerned the so-called “Sea-Peoples”, known from Egyptian
    monuments, and whether or not these included Aegean warriors.

  zh: 最近，耶斯珀·范登伯格在我们的[Facebook页面](http://www.facebook.com/AWMagazine)上提出了两个相关问题。第一个问题是关于我在书籍[*Ares的侍从*](https://www.henchmenofares.com/)中对迈锡尼战士重建的问题，这与[安德烈亚·萨林贝蒂](http://www.salimbeti.com/micenei/index.htm)提出的重建形成了明显对比。第二个问题涉及所谓的“海上民族”，这些民族以埃及纪念碑为知名，并且其中是否包括爱琴海战士。

  zh: 重建爱琴海战士
- en: The main problem regarding Aegean warriors concerns the use of metal armour
    and shields in the period prior to the fall of the Mycenaean palaces around 1200
    BC. Some people take the Homeric epics as historical documents that contain useful
    information about the period around 1200 BC and extrapolate from that. In the *Iliad*,
    warriors wear metal body-armour, greaves and helmets with “nodding crests”, and
    they invariably possess large shields.

  zh: 关于爱琴海战士的主要问题涉及公元前1200年前迈锡尼宫殿倒塌之前金属盔甲和盾牌的使用。有些人将荷马史诗视为包含关于公元前1200年左右时期有用信息的历史文献，并从中推断。在《伊利亚特》中，战士们穿着金属护甲、护胫和带有“点头羽冠”的头盔，并且他们必定拥有大型盾牌。
- en: 'But do the Homeric epics reflect the world of the Mycenaean Bronze Age? There
    are undoubtedly elements that date back to that period, as I explain in *Henchmen
    of Ares*. A war between Greeks (Mycenaeans) in the north-west of Asia Minor is
    plausible, and there are some Hittite sources – again, referred to in the book
    – that show unrest in a region known as Wilusa, which can most probably be identified
    with the Greek Ilion (Troy). Even some of the political geography in Greece dates
    back to the Bronze Age: Mycenae was a small town in the Archaic and Classical
    periods, so the kingdom of Agamemnon must have been something passed on orally
    from one generation to the next.'

  zh: 但是，荷马史诗是否反映了迈锡尼青铜时代的世界？毫无疑问，其中有些元素可以追溯到那个时期，正如我在[*Ares的侍从*](https://www.henchmenofares.com/)中所解释的那样。公元前1200年左右在小亚细亚西北部的希腊人（迈锡尼人）之间的战争是合理的，并且书中提到的一些赫梯文献显示了一个名为Wilusa的地区的动荡，这很可能可以认同为希腊的伊利翁（特洛伊）。即使在希腊的政治地理上也可以追溯到青铜时代：迈锡尼在拜占庭和古典时期是一个小镇，所以阿伽门农王国必须是口头传承的一代一代传承下来的东西。
- en: As always, however, the devil is in the details. When we look at the actual
    social structure, we find little that is very similar to the bureaucratic structures
    of the Mycenaean kingdoms. The palaces of the kings look more like large farmhouses.
    Odysseus’ palace in Ithaca has geese waddling about and a dung heap near the entrance,
    where the hero’s old dog recognizes his disguised master before expiring. In no
    way does it resemble a Mycenaean palace. There are no archives, no scribes, no
    officials to deal with storage and the production of vast amounts of, for example,
    oil or wine. It resembles more closely the structures known archaeologically from
    the eighth and seventh centuries BC.

  zh: 然而，如常所说，魔鬼藏在细节中。当我们看到实际的社会结构时，我们发现很少有与迈锡尼王国的官僚结构非常相似的东西。国王的宫殿更像是大型农舍。奥德修斯在伊萨卡岛的宫殿里有鹅在那里走动，入口附近有一个粪堆，在那里英雄的老狗认出了他伪装的主人然后死去。它根本不像迈锡尼宫殿。没有档案，没有文书，没有官员负责储存和生产大量的例如油或酒。它更像是考古学上已知的公元前八至七世纪的结构。
- en: Homer probably lived around 700 BC and it comes as no surprise that most of
    the physical artefacts and structures in his works resemble those of his own age,
    including the equipment of his heroes. Metal cuirasses are known from Argos as
    early as the late eighth century BC, and metal helmets were introduced around
    that time, too, perhaps from Assyria. The large shields in the Homeric epics all
    appear to be round and are quite compatible with shields known from Geometric
    and Archaic Greek pottery. Hans van Wees has even argued that some shields may,
    in fact, be Argive (hoplite) shields, with a double-grip. The presence of a “Mycenaean”
    boar’s-tusk helmet in the *Iliad* might be an heirloom or a find from a tomb that
    a farmer stumbled upon and that Homer saw at some point.**

  zh: 荷马可能生活在公元前700年左右，大部分物理文物和结构都与他那个时代相似，包括他作品中的英雄装备。 自公元前8世纪晚期阿尔戈斯已知有金属护胸甲，同时也在那个时期引入了金属头盔，可能来自亚述。
    荷马史诗中的大圆盾看起来与几何和原始希腊陶器上已知的盾牌非常相似。 汉斯·范·维斯甚至认为一些盾牌实际上可能是阿尔戈斯（重装步兵）的盾牌，带有双手把。 *伊利亚特*
    中的“米底那”野猪牙头盔可能是一件传家宝，或者是一个农民偶然发现的墓葬遗物，荷马曾经见过。
- en: For the thirteenth century BC, we have no evidence at all of metal body-armour
    or shields. These are features of the earlier Mycenaean epoch – for example, the
    bronze lobster cuirass from a tomb at Dendra – or of the period after the fall
    of the Mycenaean palaces, especially the middle of the twelfth century BC. For
    the Mycenaean era itself, we have warriors in waisted tunics with spears, short
    swords, and boar’s-tusk helmets. They are never shown wearing metal armour or
    using shields. A fresco from Pylos that was once thought to depict a round shield
    was wrongly reconstructed. This is not to say that metal armour was not used at
    all, but simply that it doesn’t appear to have been as common as is often thought,
    and reconstructions showing Mycenaean warriors of ca. 1200 BC universally clad
    in bronze from head to toe and brandishing shields are probably wrong.

  zh: 对于公元前13世纪，我们完全没有金属护体装甲或盾牌的证据。 这些都是早期米底那时代的特征 - 例如从登德拉的墓葬中的青铜龙虾护胸甲 - 或者在米底那王宫倒塌后的时期，特别是公元前12世纪中期的特征。
    就米底那时代本身而言，我们看到穿着腰身束褶长袍的战士，手持长矛，短剑和野猪牙头盔。 他们从未穿戴金属盔甲或使用盾牌。 一幅曾被错误重建为描绘圆盾的比洛斯壁画。
    这并不意味着金属盔甲没有被使用，而只是它看起来并没有像通常认为的那样普遍，而且重建的描绘米底那战士约公元前1200年身披铜甲从头到脚挥舞盾牌的场景可能是错误的。

  zh: 神秘的“海上民族”
- en: As regards the “Sea-Peoples”, the designation derives from Egyptian sources.
    We know that Egypt suffered from attacks by these people, especially during the
    reign of Ramesses III (r. 1186–1155 BC). The entire eastern Mediterranean was
    suffering from instability around 1200 BC. In the first half of the twelfth century
    BC, several civilizations crumbled, including the Mycenaean palace civilization
    and the Hittite Empire, and some city-states were destroyed, such as Ugarit in
    Syria. (See also [*Ancient Warfare* IV.4](https://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/cms/).)

  zh: 至于“海上民族”，这个称号来源于埃及的资料。 我们知道埃及在这些人的攻击中受到了打击，特别是在拉美西斯三世（在位1186-1155年BC）统治期间。 大约在公元前1200年，整个东地中海地区都饱受动荡。
    在公元前12世纪上半叶，包括米底那王宫文明和赫梯帝国在内的几个文明崩溃，一些城邦也被摧毁，例如叙利亚的乌加里特。（另见[*古代战争* IV.4](https://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/cms/)。）
- en: The Sea-Peoples are sometimes thought to have caused the downfall of the Mycenaean
    palaces. Certainly, human agency was involved, since many of the palaces show
    signs of burning. But whether the “Sea-Peoples” were responsible for all this,
    or just a symptom of more widespread unrest, is an open question. It is quite
    possible that various factors – natural disaster such as famine or epidemic, rebellions,
    political strife, and so on – conspired to create a situation in which some people
    decided to turn to the sea. Some scholars have suggested that the Mycenaeans later
    formed the “Sea-Peoples” or that part of them joined the “Sea-Peoples” on their
    trek through the eastern Mediterranean.

  zh: “海上民族”有时被认为导致了米底那王宫的衰落。 当然，人为因素参与其中，因为许多宫殿显示出烧毁的迹象。 但是“海上民族”是否对此负责，或者只是更广泛动荡的一种症状，这是一个悬而未决的问题。
    很可能各种因素 - 如饥荒或流行病等自然灾害，叛乱，政治斗争等 - 共同造成了一种情况，使得一些人决定转向大海。 一些学者建议，米底那人后来形成了“海上民族”，或者其中的一部分人参加了“海上民族”穿越东地中海的旅行。
- en: Some of the names used to denote some groups by the Egyptians are suggestive
    of particular ethnonyms. The “Sherden”, for example, may be identified with peoples
    from Sardinia. There are some suggestive figurines – al dated to the ninth or
    eighth centuries BC in the conventional chronology – that are very similar to
    Egyptian depictions of these people. The “Meshwesh” were people from Libya. Most
    interestingly, the “Ekwesh” have been compared to the Achaeans (Greeks) from Homer,
    who may have been known to the Hittites, as recorded in documents recovered from
    the archives of their capital at Hattusa, as the “Ahhiyawa”. Similarly, the “Denyen”
    might be identified with the Danaans, another term used by Homer to denote the
    Greeks.

  zh: 埃及人用来指代一些族群的一些名称暗示了特定的民族名称。例如，“谢尔登”可能与来自撒丁岛的人民有关。有一些暗示性的小雕像——按传统年代学的说法，大约在公元前九或八世纪——与埃及对这些人的描绘非常相似。而“梅什韦什”是来自利比亚的人民。最有趣的是，“艾克韦什”被认为与荷马作品中的（希腊）阿契人相似，这些人可能为赫梯人所知，正如从他们在哈图沙的首都哈图沙的档案中恢复的文件中记录的那样，“阿希雅瓦”。同样，“丹耶恩”可能与丹那人（荷马用来指代希腊人的另一个术语）有关。
- en: What we have, then, is a lot of suggestive data. The Sea-Peoples were either
    a disruptive force in the eastern Mediterranean after ca. 1200 BC or a symptom
    of some other problem (or perhaps both). The Sea-Peoples included a variety of
    different people from different places, probably including Sardinia and Mycenaean
    Greece. The depictions of warriors on the walls of the mortuary temple of Ramesses
    III at Medinet Habu resemble particular peoples, like the Mycenaeans. As a result,
    it is possible to reconstruct some events in broad strokes, even if the exact
    causes of the unrest in the eastern Mediterranean remain mysterious (famine? plague?
    social unrest?), and many of the details are frustratingly vague.

  zh: 那么，我们拥有大量的暗示性数据。海上民族可能是公元前1200年后东地中海地区的一个破坏性力量，或者是某种其他问题的症状（或者两者兼而有之）。海上民族包括来自不同地方的各种不同人群，可能包括撒丁岛和迈锡尼希腊人。在拉美西斯三世的墓祠庙Medinet
    Habu的墙壁上描绘的战士与特定人群如迈锡尼人相似。因此，可以粗略重建一些事件，即使东地中海地区动荡的确切原因仍然神秘（饥荒？瘟疫？社会动荡？），许多细节令人沮丧地模糊不清。
