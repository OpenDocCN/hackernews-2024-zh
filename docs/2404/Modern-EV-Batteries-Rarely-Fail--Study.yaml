    batteries, usually a type of lithium-ion chemistry. A failure of the battery usually
    affects its output, can immobilize the vehicle and might result in a fire risk.

    showed that initially (2011-2015), battery replacements due to failure, [outside
    of recalls like the Chevrolet Bolt EV](https://insideevs.com/news/533020/chevrolet-bolt-ev-fire-georgia/),
    were much more frequent than in the later years (2016-2023).

    percent of vehicles ended with a battery failure. According to the data, the worst
    model year was 2011 with a 7.5% failure rate (aside from recalls). In the next
    few years, it was 1.6-4.4%, which indicates that several percent of EV users were
    affected by a battery failure.

    battery replacements due to failures, excluding recalls. It was as high as 0.5%
    starting in 2016, but in most cases, it was from 0.1% to 0.3%. That's an order
    of magnitude improvement.

    manufacturer's warranty. The improvements come from learning and more mature technologies,
    including active liquid battery cooling, new strategies of thermal battery management
    as well as new battery chemistries. We could probably add many more things, as
    virtually everything become more advanced with very strict quality control.

    world is. However, the news that battery replacements due to failures are less
    frequent is positive.

    is acceptable or if the EV industry should aim for an even lower level by 2030.
