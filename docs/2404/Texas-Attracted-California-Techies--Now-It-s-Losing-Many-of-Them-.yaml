- en: Smarter anti-immigration conservatives make the case that by using foreign labor
    to solve America’s skilled-labor shortages, the country stifles the process by
    which native Americans might be trained up to meet skilled-labor demand. We import
    doctors and engineers because it’s cheaper than training our own. Whether that’s
    true or not, Texas is doing something similar with “Californians.” The state stinks
    at developing its own labor force. And why should we bother when we can poach
    workers from other states?

  zh: 更聪明的反移民保守派提出，通过利用外国劳动力解决美国的技术劳动力短缺问题，会抑制本国人才培养的进程。我们之所以引进医生和工程师，是因为这比培养我们自己的人更便宜。不管这是不是事实，德克萨斯州正以类似的方式对待“加利福尼亚人”。该州在发展自己的劳动力方面做得很糟糕。我们为什么要费心培养，当我们可以从其他州挖来工人呢？

    move in both directions. What happens when the influx slows—and we’re left with
    our own atrophied mechanisms for generating growth? Well, we can do what Americans
    have always done. We can hitch the U-Haul to the Cybertruck and hit the road.

  zh: 但是没有繁荣是永久的，甲骨文的离开提醒了我们，人们可以双向流动。当涌入减少时会发生什么情况？我们将只剩下自己萎缩的增长机制？嗯，我们可以像美国人一直做的那样。我们可以把U-Haul挂在Cybertruck上，踏上旅途。
