The steam funnels are an appendage of the city’s extensive network of pipes that distribute steam, at high pressure and about 400 degrees Fahrenheit, to office towers and apartment buildings throughout the densest parts of Manhattan.

Created 142 years ago, the steam system is the United States’s oldest and, with 105 miles of pipes, its largest. The utility company Consolidated Edison uses those pipes, most of which are buried beneath the city’s streets, to supply steam for heating, cooling and other commercial uses like dry cleaning.
