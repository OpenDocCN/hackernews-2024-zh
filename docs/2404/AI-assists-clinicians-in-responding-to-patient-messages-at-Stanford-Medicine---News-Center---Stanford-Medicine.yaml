    draft responses to patient portal messages, reducing health care providers’ workload
    and alleviating burnout.

- en: The artificial intelligence-generated drafts, which are reviewed and edited
    by a clinician before they are shared with the patient, help respond to clinical
    inquires, such as what to do about symptoms of a cold or side effects of a medication.
    In a study of the AI-generated responses, clinicians reported a reduction in everyday
    clerical burden and fewer feelings of burnout.

    in late 2022, it ignited a wave of excitement and anticipation about the potential

    message within seconds. Integration with the electronic health record allowed
    the draft responses to appear in the clinician’s inbox, where they could seamlessly
    review them, make any necessary edits and send the final response back to the
    patient. The responses were generated over the course of five weeks in July and
    August 2023 on behalf of 162 primary care and gastroenterology clinicians.

    a large language model to generate draft responses for patient messages and to
    enable the use of such a tool by a broader care team that includes nurses, advanced

    Garcia said. “I think what makes this study particularly impactful is that it’s
    capturing what it’s like to deploy this tool in a way that would be practical
    and reflective of a real care environment.” She noted that it’s not just doctors
    who respond to patients — nurses, advanced practice clinician and pharmacists
    all work collectively to answer patient messages.

- en: After the pilot period, Garcia and the team issued a survey to the clinicians,
    asking them to report on their experience. They reported that the AI-generated
    drafts lightened the cognitive load of responding to patient messages and improved
    their feelings of work exhaustion despite objective findings that the drafts did
    not save the clinicians’ time. That’s still a win, Garcia said, as this tool is
    likely to have even broader applicability and impact as it evolves.

    new technology came to fruition during a time when we needed a different, innovative
    solution. We’re already seeing a positive impact on relieving burden, and I think
    it’s just going to get more effective as we continue to iterate.”
