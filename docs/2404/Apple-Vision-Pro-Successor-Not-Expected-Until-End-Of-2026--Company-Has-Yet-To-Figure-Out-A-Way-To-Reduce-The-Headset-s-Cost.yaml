- en: The demand for [Apple Vision Pro](https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-is-the-ar-headset-from-the-company/)
    is slowly dwindling, but the company’s long-term goals have not budged an inch.
    A new report states that the successor to the $3,499 AR headset could launch sometime
    by the end of 2026\. However, there is a huge glaring issue that Apple needs to
    address, or this product category will most likely never take off, and that is
    pricing. For that to happen, the technology giant needs to bring down its component
    costs, but with each current-generation unit estimated to [set back Apple by $1,542](https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-cost-to-make-the-3499-headset/),
    the road to a more affordable head-mounted wearable is long and hard.

    in its reported effort to bring down the mammoth $456 sum it has to pay for its
    mixed-reality headset’s 4K micro-OLED panels. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman,
    his latest ‘Power On’ newsletter mentions that the launch of the Apple Vision
    Pro successor may not happen until the end of 2026, but before a second-generation
    product materializes, the technology needs to bring down its cost somehow.

    model until the end of 2026, though the company is trying to figure out a way
    to bring a cheaper version to market before then. Apple is still flummoxed by
    how exactly to bring down the cost, I’m told.

- en: Apple is introducing a new version of the Vision Pro’s software this year —
    visionOS 2.0 — but that isn’t expected to be a game changer. The next big step
    for the headset will be international expansion, with Apple getting ready to bring
    the device to China in the very near future.”

    a low-cost headset, with previous reports stating that it [may launch in 2025](https://wccftech.com/apple-budget-and-premium-ar-headset-to-launch-in-2025/).
    However, there will be some striking differences between this version and the
    more expensive Apple Vision Pro, such as the more affordable option [featuring
    an iPhone chipset](https://wccftech.com/low-cost-apple-vision-pro-to-use-iphone-chip-inferior-display-to-reduce-cost/)
    instead of a Mac one or using a more inferior display than the dual 4K micro-OLED
    panels. The Cupertino will also attempt to revitalize Apple Vision Pro sales by
    [launching the device in China](https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-to-launch-in-china-later-this-year/) later
    this year.

    the pricing problem is not addressed at this stage. An earlier rumor claimed Apple
    could [reduce its display costs by 50 percent](https://wccftech.com/apple-pushing-rd-of-low-cost-headset-display-price-reduced/) by
    partnering with Chinese panel manufacturers SeeYA and BOE. Whether the company
    forms this business alliance in the future is another story, but whatever changes
    the Apple Vision Pro successor will flaunt, we will continue to provide timely
    updates.
