- en: MORE THAN two decades have passed since we published an academic paper linking
    the legalisation of abortion to the enormous decline in American crime since the
    1990s. The underlying theory is straightforward. Children who are unwanted at
    birth are at risk of a range of adverse life outcomes and commit much more crime
    later in life. Legalised abortion greatly reduced the number of unwanted births.
    Consequently, legalised abortion will reduce crime, albeit with substantial lags.

    the topic in the best-selling book “Freakonomics”, written by one of us with Stephen
    Dubner, published in 2005\. For many, it was more important to spin a political
    response to our hypothesis than to evaluate whether it was correct.
