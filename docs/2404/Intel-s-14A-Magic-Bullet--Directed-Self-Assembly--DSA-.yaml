- en: Intel’s 18A node gets most of the spotlight recently – with an ongoing battle
    between TSMC’s and Intel’s management teams on the merits of TSMC N2 vs Intel’s
    18A. However, it is 14A that will be the make-or-break node for Intel Foundry.
    Winning customers starts with process technology, and Intel is betting big here,
    but they need a generation where everyone gets comfortable. Customers will use
    18A to dip their toes in the Intel waters with less critical chips that are not
    core to their business; if all goes well, they will look to 14A as the main process
    for their linchpin designs – think the largest, expensive dies like AI accelerators,
    CPUS, and potentially even mobile in 2027.

    or else they will not have enough scale and volume to compete given their internal
    product business will continue to lose market share for the next few years. It
    simply isn’t possible to run a leading-edge foundry without multiple large, leading-edge

    scanners in high volume manufacturing. Both TSMC and Samsung have only ordered
    tools for R&D. Intel, perhaps trying to correct for being late to the low-NA game,
    has been high-NA’s loudest and strongest champion. With the first customer-owned
    example now being installed in their Hillsboro fab, Intel will have a head start
    on R&D and real-world experience with high-NA scanners.

    the technology maturity that -- in the high-volume production, that's all important.
    Everything. Everything counted together. So we -- every time we know that there
    are some new structure, new tools such as high-NA EUV, we look at it carefully,
    look at the maturity of the tools, look at the cost of the tools and look at the
    schedule of that -- how to achieve it. We always make the right decision at the
    right moment to serve our customer.

- en: The main challenge driving high cost on high-NA is the critical dimension (CD)
    vs. dose curve and its flow-through to throughput and cost per wafer. Critical
    dimension is the width of the smallest line or space that can be imaged by a lithography
    scanner. Achieving good image quality at lower CDs requires exponentially higher
    doses. Because of limited light source power, delivering higher doses means the
    scanner must run more slowly, waiting for enough photons to reach each exposure
    field. Running slowly means fewer wafers produced by the scanner, which translates
    to a big cost increase when using a tool depreciating by  more than $150,000 per
    day. For a more detailed discussion, see [our piece on high-NA cost](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/asml-dilemma-high-na-euv-is-worse).

- en: Lower exposure doses allow the scanner to run at or close to its maximum, stage-limited
    throughput. While normally the image quality would be unacceptably poor, with
    directed self assembly it can be rectified. Directed Self Assembly (DSA) is a
    nanopatterning technique that utilizes the self-organizing properties of block
    copolymers, guided by pre-patterned templates. In simple terms, it can repair
    the feature, dramatically reducing the dose required and actually improving the
    final pattern quality.

    only a handful to dozen nanometers long, are linked by a covalent bond to form
    the BCP. The current state-of-the-art polymer used is polystyrene-block-poly(methyl
    methacrylate), abbreviated as PS-*b*-PMMA.

    is a nonpolar molecule while PMMA is polar – they naturally will separate into
    layers, as that’s the lowest energy arrangement. PS-*b­*-PMMA, naturally *wants*
    to arrange into a regular, orderly pattern of layers. Adding energy in the form
    of heat allows the molecules to more quickly find this equilibrium arrangement.

    less than an hour results in a regular pattern of PS and PMMA alternating lines,
    each ~20nm wide. If that sounds like a good starting point for producing ultra-thin
    metal wires to connect billions of transistors together (an M0 layer in leading-edge
    logic)... you’d be correct.
