- en: Today, we’re taking a major step toward our vision for a more open computing
    platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating system that powers
    our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers, giving developers a larger
    ecosystem to build for and ultimately creating more choice for consumers. This
    platform is the product of a decade of investment into the underlying technologies
    that enable mixed reality, and opening it up means a lot more people will benefit
    from that investment. We’re working with leading global technology companies to
    create a new ecosystem of mixed reality devices, and we’re making it even easier
    for developers to build mixed reality apps.

    reality to as many people as possible. With more devices, this new ecosystem will
    offer more choice to consumers and businesses around the world. Developers will
    have a much larger range of hardware that can run their apps, and more device
    makers will expand their market to a wider range of users, much like we’ve seen
    with PCs and smartphones.

    operating system that powers our Meta Quest headsets. Meta Horizon OS combines
    the core technologies that power today’s mixed reality experiences with a suite
    of features that put social presence at the center of the platform.

- en: Meta Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work at Meta to build a next-generation
    computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we developed technologies
    like inside-out-tracking and self-tracked controllers. To allow for more natural
    interaction systems and social presence, we pioneered hand, eye, face and body
    tracking. And for mixed reality, we built a full stack of technologies for blending
    the digital and physical worlds, including high-resolution Passthrough, Scene
    Understanding and Spatial Anchors. This long-term investment that began on the
    mobile-first foundations of the Android Open Source Project has produced a full
    mixed reality operating system used by millions of people.

    mixed reality experiences. And they can reach their audiences and grow their businesses
    through the content discovery and monetization platforms built into Meta Horizon
    OS, including the Meta Quest Store, which we’ll rename the Meta Horizon Store.

- en: The social layer of Meta Horizon OS means people’s identities, avatars, social
    graphs and friend groups can move with them across virtual spaces, and developers
    can integrate these social features into their apps. And because this social layer
    is made to bridge multiple platforms, people can spend time together in virtual
    spaces that exist across mixed reality, mobile and desktop devices. Meta Horizon
    OS devices will also use the same mobile companion app that Meta Quest owners
    use today, which we’ll rename to the Meta Horizon app.

    the ways app developers can reach their audiences. We’re beginning the process
    of removing the barriers between the Meta Horizon Store and App Lab, which lets
    any developer who meets basic technical and content requirements release software
    on the platform. App Lab titles will soon be featured in a dedicated section of
    the store on all our devices, making them easy for larger audiences to discover.

    already familiar with to bring their mobile apps to Meta Horizon OS or to create
    entirely new mixed reality apps.
