- en: Ego is building an AI-native game, engine, and platform where users can create
    and share 3D animated characters, worlds, games and scripted interactions all
    using natural language. We started by building a survivalcraft game similar to
    Valheim and Minecraft with an Animal Crossing/Sims-style village in the town.
    All the npcs/villagers will be powered by LLM agents where they’ll have their
    own lives, personalities, and routines. The game will allow you to mod the game
    while you play it with natural language instead of coding.

    fast, is interested in trying new technologies, and works well in a small team
    of game developers, designers, and technical artists. If you like the sound of
    making games, pushing the boundaries of gaming technology, and you thrive in a
    fast-paced startup environment, we'd love to hear from you!
