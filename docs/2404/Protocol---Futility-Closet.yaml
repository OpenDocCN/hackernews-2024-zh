    hearing, the psychologist or psychiatrist shall wear a cone-shaped hat that is
    not less than two feet tall. The surface of the hat shall be imprinted with stars
    and lightning bolts. Additionally, a psychologist or psychiatrist shall be required
    to don a white beard that is not less than 18 inches in length and shall punctuate
    crucial elements of his testimony by stabbing the air with a wand. Whenever a
    psychologist or psychiatrist provides expert testimony regarding a defendant’s
    competency, the bailiff shall contemporaneously dim the courtroom lights and administer
    two strikes to a Chinese gong.

    the house of representatives when sponsor Duncan Scott explained that he’d intended
    it as satire — he felt that too many mental health practitioners had been acting
    as expert witnesses. It was withdrawn and never signed into law.
