> 来源：[https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/apriora/jobs/IoC1DU7-full-stack-software-engineer](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/apriora/jobs/IoC1DU7-full-stack-software-engineer)

### Why Apriora?

Apriora is **one of the fastest growing startups** to come out of the latest YC batch with strong traction. We’re generating revenue and well-funded by some of the best investors in the Valley with years of runway.

### What are you up to?

Apriora is building the **future of hiring**. Apriora conducts job interviews in real-time with an AI recruiter. Companies use us to get the best hiring signal on their applicant pool and hire in a fraction of the time. Our AI recruiter has a live conversation over a video call with each of your candidates based on the interview questions you choose or that are recommended based on the job description. During the interview, our AI asks personalized follow-up questions in real-time based on the candidate's responses. Our AI recruiter can be customized to your roles in minutes and has already conducted thousands of interviews across engineering, IT, retail, hospitality, and more.

### Who are you?

We’re people who:

*   genuinely enjoy solving complex engineering problems
*   learn quickly and do what it takes to deliver results
*   work really, really hard
*   move with urgency

### What technologies do you use?

You should have experience in:

*   Javascript (Typescript, React, Node, Next)
*   Python (FastAPI, concurrency)
*   Cloud / DevOps (Azure, Kubernetes, Docker)
*   System Architecture

We also work with:

*   Real-time streaming (WebRTC, web sockets)
*   ML/DL (open source, inference at scale)

### What can I work on?

Apriora is similar to a marketplace, as we serve both candidates through the interview experience and employers through the data aggregation and analysis platform. As a hands-on engineer, you will build both consumer-facing and enterprise-grade software with a clear opportunity for growth. Problems that you could work on related to consumer software are:

*   How can we bring the average interviewer response latency down to 200ms?
*   How can we fine-tune our models to decrease hallucination and increase response accuracy?
*   How will our system architecture change as we scale to thousands more users, concurrently?

Problems that you could work on related to enterprise software are:

*   How do we integrate with our customer’s internal hiring systems?
*   What’s the best way to present the interview data visually and as fast as possible?
*   And many, many feature requests that need to be built out!

### What’s in it for me?

*   Take ownership of building the next billion dollar company
*   Collaborate with a tight-knit team of talented builders
*   Launch products that directly impact people’s careers
*   Work with the co-founders daily in-person in SF
*   Competitive salary and equity
*   Health insurance, unlimited PTO, and great company events

If you’ve gotten this far and our culture/tech resonate with you, **we want you to apply**. Submit your application with the phrase “fast track” and we’ll fast track your application with an interview directly.
