    you develop a complicated relationship to the corporate AI research powerhouses,
    such as Googe DeepMind, OpenAI, and Meta AI. Whenever you see one of these papers
    that train some kind of gigantic neural net model to do something you were not
    even sure a neural network could do, unquestionably pushing the state of the art
    and reconfiguring your ideas of what is possible, you get conflicting emotions.
    On the one hand: it is very impressive. Good on you for pushing AI forward. On
    the other hand: how could we possibly keep up? As an AI academic, leading a lab
    with a few PhD students and (if you’re lucky) some postdoctoral fellows, perhaps
    with a few dozen Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in your lab, this kind of research
    is simply not possible to do.'

    you had a decent desktop computer and an internet connection you had everything
    you needed to compete with the best of researchers out there. Ground-breaking
    papers were often written by one or two people who ran all the experiments on
    their regular workstations. It is useful to point this out particularly for those
    who have come into the research field within the last decade, and for which the
    need for gigantic compute resources is a given.

    we have seen that more data and more compute yield quantitatively and often even
    qualitatively better results. (By the time you are reading this, that list of
    very recent AI milestones might very well be outdated.). Of course there are improvements
    to learning algorithms and network architectures as well, but these improvements
    are mostly useful in the context of the massive scale of experiments. (Sutton
    talks about the “Bitter Pill”, referring to the insight that simple methods that
    scale well always win the day when more compute becomes available [[22](#bib.bib22)].)
    A scale that is not achievable by academic researchers nowadays. As far as we

    When you have been working on a research topic for a while and, say, DeepMind
    or OpenAI decides to work on the same thing, you will likely feel the same way

    So, let’s say you secure $50k of funding for cloud compute from somewhere and
    go ahead running your big experiment. But this is a very small amount of money
    compared to what training something like GPT-3 costs. The recent open AI agent
    that learned to craft a diamond pickaxe in Minecraft required training of 9 days
    on 720 V100 GPUs [[2](#bib.bib2)]; this amounts to a few hundred thousand dollars
    for a single experiment. Not even prestigious European Research Council (EU) or
    National Science Foundation (US) grants can support such a level of investment.
    Still, spending $50k on cloud compute will give you significantly more compute
    than a bunch of gaming PCs taped together, so you could scale at least a little
    bit. At least for that very experiment. But as we all know, most experiments don’t
    work the first time you try them. For every big successful experiment we see reported,
    we have unreported months or maybe years of prototypes, proofs of concept, debugging,
    parameter tuning, and failed starts. You need this level of compute available
    constantly.

  zh: 最明显的问题是访问中央处理单元（CPUs）和图形处理单元（GPUs）。所以，假设你从某处获得了$50k的云计算资金，那么就继续进行你的大实验。但是，与像训练GPT-3这样的东西相比，这是一笔非常小的资金。最近，OpenAI的代理学会在《我的世界》中学会制作钻石镐，需要在720个V100
    GPUs上进行9天的训练[[2](#bib.bib2)]；这相当于单次实验的几十万美元。即使是欧洲研究理事会（EU）或美国国家科学基金会（NSF）的声望也无法支持如此高水平的投资。但是，花费$50k在云计算上将为您提供比一堆拼在一起的游戏PCs更多的计算能力，所以您至少可以进行一些扩展。至少在那个实验中。但众所周知，大多数实验第一次尝试时都不会成功。对于我们看到报道的每一个大型成功实验，都有数月甚至数年的原型、概念验证、调试、参数调整和失败的开端。你需要这种计算能力始终可用。
- en: The less obvious problem is that you need the right kind of team to build experimental
    software that scales, and that is generally not compatible with academic career
    structures. Most of the members of a typical academic research lab in computer
    science are PhD students that need to graduate within a few years, and need to
    have an individual project to work on which results in multiple first-author papers
    so they can get a job afterwards. A large-scale AI project typically means that
    most members of the team work for many months or years on the same project, where
    only one of them can be the first author on the paper. The team will probably
    also include people who do “mundane” software engineering tasks that are crucial
    to the success of the project, but which are not seen as AI research in themselves.
    The structures needed for successful large scale projects are simply not compatible

    academic AI research. Even if one manages to secure large-scale multimillion projects
    this covers only a fraction of human and computational resources that are necessary
    for contemporary AI research, and the career structures and IP rights regimes
    of universities often impose further limits. One popular alternative among AI
    scientists is to spin out their idea from their university lab and found a company
    that will gradually transfer AI research to a set of commercial-standard services
    or products. Both authors have been part of this journey through co-founding modl.ai

    [[16](#bib.bib16)] 就是这样的旅程，并从中学到了很多经验。

    access to rich data from real-world applications that you wouldn’t be able to

- en: This journey is far from straightforward, however, as there are several limiting
    factors to consider. First, not all research ideas are directly applicable to
    a startup business model. Your best research ideas might be brilliant in terms
    of understanding the world, or at least getting published in highly prestigious
    venues, but that does not mean that one can easily make products out of them.
    Second, many outstanding results one obtained in the lab today may have to go
    through a long runway until they turn into a business case of some sort. Most
    startups do development rather than research, as the runways are short and you
    need to have a functioning product, preferably with some market traction, before
    the next funding round in two years or so. Third, even if you do get some investment,
    this does not mean you have an unlimited compute budget. With seed grants often
    in the range of a few millions, this does not buy you the capacity to do OpenAI-level
    experiments, especially as you need to pay real salaries (not PhD stipends) to
    your employees. Fourth, not every AI academic enjoys this type of an adventure.
    At the end of the day most academics have long agreed on their priorities when
    they opted to follow the academic career path. You don’t become a professor for
    the money. The security of an academic environment (given that it is both safe
    and creative), means to some far more than any potentially higher salary or other
    corporate benefits.

- en: Universities can also help their faculty manage the changed competitive landscape
    by encouraging and allowing them to be more risk-taking. The comparative advantage
    of academic researchers in AI is to do more high-risk exploration, and incentive
    structures at universities must change to account for this. For example, it is
    unreasonable to expect a steady stream of papers at top-tier conferences such
    as NeurIPS and AAAI; large, well-funded industry research labs will have large
    advantages at writing such papers. Similarly, the grant funding structure is such
    that it rewards safe and incremental research on popular topics; this seems to
    be an inherent feature of the way grant applications are evaluated, and it is
    unlikely to change however often funding agencies use words like “disruptive”.
    The kind of research that is favored by some of the most traditional (closed-call)
    grant mechanisms is mostly the kind of research where academic AI researchers
    will not be able to compete with industry. Therefore, universities should probably
    avoid making grant funding a condition for hires and promotions. If universities
    are serious about incentivizing their faculty to leverage their competitive advantage,
    they should reward trying and failing and promote high-risk high-gain funding
    schemes and research initiatives. It is then likely that funding agencies will
    follow the trend and invest even more on basic and blue sky research.
