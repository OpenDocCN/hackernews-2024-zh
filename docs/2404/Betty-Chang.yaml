- en: 2023’s stacking up to be a bloodbath for early-stage digital health startups…
    and it’s only January. Digital health has always been challenging to build in
    — with lengthier sales cycles, higher implementation costs, and regulatory red
    tape all over. Tack on the pressure of rising interest rates making capital costly
    and startup valuations tank, investors are skittish. Funding into digital health
    startups in 2022 was [only half](https://rockhealth.com/insights/2022-year-end-digital-health-funding-lessons-at-the-end-of-a-funding-cycle/)
    of 2021’s.

    the second highest year ever. Experienced investors are sticking around because
    the long-term opportunity is clear. And on top of that, the digital health gold
    rush over the past ten years has produced builders with earned industry knowledge.
    This resetting moment leaves us with more disciplined, profit-driven founders.

    both healthcare SaaS and tech-enabled care delivery services, to understand the
    challenges and opportunities across their companies. I’ve also gotten a front
    row seat of the successes and mistakes of my own healthcare infrastructure startup.
    I’m here to share with early-stage founders the common pitfalls I’ve seen *specific*
    to building in digital health — and advice on how to avoid them.

    founders with empathy.

    system averages 12 to 18 months to navigate their operational budget cycles (closing
    health plans take even longer!), identify an internal champion, put together a
    compelling ROI use case, and navigate bureaucratic procurement processes. Which
    is why you need to plan for your GTM upmarket earlier than later. The minute you
    see repeatable usage patterns among a core customer profile, you should begin
    your motions into enterprise.

- en: Another relevant pitfall I see here is founders thinking their enterprise strategy
    is completely separate from their DTC or SMB starting point. It’s true that SMB
    and enterprise sales are different motions and require different GTM teams. But
    **founders should be able to identify needs that are common to both small fish
    and whales so early traction can be laddered up into building a compelling ROI
    use case for enterprise.** For example, if you’re planning on doing VBC contracts
    with payers, you have to make sure your gathering the right evidence in your DTC
    channels. If you want to sell into big employers with a B2C2B strategy, it probably
    makes sense to focus your customer acquisition in regions where they have lots
    of employees.

    manage their balance sheets even more closely. You must have a solid business
    model that bends the traditional P&L of care (remember those razor-thin margins?),
    either by making it less costly to provide care or by improving outcomes without
    making care more expensive. And in finding the right balance on the growth vs.
    profitability spectrum, err towards improving margins in these market conditions.
    Healthcare is a long game, which means being the one left standing at the end
    can be a competitive advantage in itself.

    enterprise customer could take 18+ months, so you should plan for at least two
    to three years of runway. [Daisy Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daisydwolf/)
    at a16z recommends founders go into investor conversations from a position of
    strength by having at least 12 months of runway. Running out of cash in healthcare
    doesn’t just impact employees, customers and investors; but more detrimentally,
    the human lives under care too.

    healthcare SaaS, this means implementation and support costs. For tech-enabled
    services, expect better gross margins over time (e.g., from 25% to 60%+) as you
    leverage tech to improve provider efficiencies. Be patient early on and expect
    lower gross margins than the generalized benchmarks that are published online.

    have [little clinical robustness](https://rockhealth.com/insights/assessing-the-clinical-robustness-of-digital-health-startups/).

    write down the measures that matter most to all the different stakeholders of
    your solution, including patients, practitioners, current buyers and future enterprise
    buyers. Understanding what measures overlap between all your stakeholders will
    help prioritize and align goals and incentives. Tracking them longitudinally will
    help you identify how to improve the quality and effectiveness of your services.
