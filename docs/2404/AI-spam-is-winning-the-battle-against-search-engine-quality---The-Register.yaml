    of AI garbage, and the web giant's attempts to curb the growth of machine-generated
    drivel haven't helped all that much.

    Originality.ai, told us Google is losing [its war](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/09/google_reverses_ai_page_spam/)
    on all that [spammy](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/17/google_search_results_spam/),
    [scammy](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/25/googles_aipowered_search_results_are/)
    content in its search results. You can see our full interview with Jon about it
    all below.

    not doing it with AI," Gillham told *The Register*. "Not all AI content is spam,
    but I think right now all spam is AI content."'

- en: Gillham's team has been producing monthly reports to track the degree to which
    AI-generated content is showing up in Google web search results. As of last month,
    about 10 percent of Google results point to AI content, it's claimed, and that's
    after Google vowed to take down a whole host of websites that were pushing such
    trash.

    collapse](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/26/what_is_model_collapse/) situation
    as AIs ingest other AI-generated material and end up regurgitating other low-grade
    synthetic data. Gillham said his AI content-recognition tech, which has been used
    to scan datasets for machine-generated infomation, can help, but it's not a total
    solution.
