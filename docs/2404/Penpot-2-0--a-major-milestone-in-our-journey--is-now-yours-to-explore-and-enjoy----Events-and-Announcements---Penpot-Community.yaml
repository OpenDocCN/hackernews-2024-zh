    impactful release.

- en: Once again, we delivered on our promise to bring developers and designers closer
    together. **Our bold movement to build CSS Grid Layout** and enable designers
    to create responsive interfaces matching coding constructs was unexpected. The
    design tool space has changed forever.

    designers and large teams build extensive design systems more modularly. The addition
    of component swapping as well as more flexible categorisation options provide
    a significant boost in productivity.'

- en: We rebuilt the entire **Penpot’s UI to be sleeker, faster and more beautiful**.
    This will be obvious to everyone that used Penpot in the past but equally mesmerising
    to newcomers. Streamlining user experience means allowing for more time spent
    creating and collaborating at scale, which sits at the core of Penpot’s mission.

    want to cut corners, we wanted to be proud of our work so you could team up and
    collaborate around design and code projects with no limitations or compromises.

    future-proof ownership of your work and a no-handoff mindset meet long-standing
    pragmatic design and coding practices.

    to roll-out 2.0 a couple of days ago and [self-host images](https://penpot.app/self-host)
    will follow very soon. We will always make sure that, no matter your choice, Penpot
    delivers the same experience.

    teams can ship upgrades independently. “Design tokens”, “Plugin architecture”,
    “AI” or “E2E testing framework” are some of them.
