    of open source developers, corporations’ reliance and profiteering from volunteer
    labor, and how these factors can create a perfect storm for any nation state or
    sophisticated cyber-crime group that wants to backdoor infrastructure for their

    this library.” End users can decide whether or not they actually trust those vendors.
