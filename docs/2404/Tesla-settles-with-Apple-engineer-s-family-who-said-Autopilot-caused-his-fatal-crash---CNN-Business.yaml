    and its controversial automated-driving system on trial starting Monday.

    Monday in a wrongful death suit filed by the family of a former Apple engineer
    who died after his Tesla Model X crashed while the Autopilot feature was engaged.
    The trial could have lasted several weeks, but the parties settled Monday.

    in Silicon Valley on March 23, 2018\. The National Transportation Safety Board,
    in its investigation, found that Autopilot was engaged for nearly 19 minutes before
    the fatal crash, when the car, traveling at 71 mph, veered off the highway.

    that has lost popularity and a third of its market value this year. CEO Elon Musk
    and the company say that its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies are
    ahead of the competition and a big reason why Tesla has become the world’s largest
    electric vehicle maker — [just ahead of Chinese rival BYD](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/03/cars/china-tesla-byd-competition-hnk-intl-dg/index.html).
    But Huang’s family said Tesla oversold its Autopilot technology’s capabilities,
    and that it is not as safe to use as advertised.

    six years since Huang’s fatal crash. After a [two-year investigation](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/13/tech/tesla-recall-autopilot/index.html)
    that analyzed 1,000 Tesla crashes while vehicles had Autopilot engaged, the National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the Autopilot system can give drivers
    a false sense of security. It can be easily misused in certain dangerous situations
    when Autopilot may be unable to safely navigate the road, NHTSA found in December
    2023.

    crashes involving Tesla vehicles using the various driver assist features, including
    a series of [crashes into emergency vehicles](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/16/business/tesla-autopilot-federal-safety-probe/index.html) on

    of its cars in the United States, giving drivers more warnings when Autopilot
    is engaged and they are not paying attention to the road or placing their hands
    on the wheel.

    and reduces fatalities. Autopilot requires drivers to keep their hands on the
    wheel and Tesla says people who use the automated-driving technology should keep
    their eyes on the road.

    30, 2018, [blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-last-week%E2%80%99s-accident),
    Tesla said Huang’s hands were not detected on his car’s steering wheel for six
    seconds prior to the crash. The company said it believes Huang was responsible
    for the crash because investigators found he was [playing a video game on his
    phone](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/tech/tesla-autopilot-safety-ntsb/index.html)

    from the concrete barrier before it crashed.

    they argued Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving
    software. They alleged Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime time
    and had flaws that could make its use unsafe.

    to pay damages, and they could have added up quickly. Wrongful death suits involving
    big companies have at times resulted in awards north of $1 billion.

    autonomous driving “has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company
