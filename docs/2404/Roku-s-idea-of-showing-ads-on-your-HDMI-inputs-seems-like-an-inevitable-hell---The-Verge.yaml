- en: In this week’s edition of his [*Lowpass* newsletter](https://www.lowpass.cc/p/roku-hdmi-ad-insertion-patent),
    Janko Roettgers covered a Roku patent that seems to telegraph that the company
    is planning some heavy advertising tactics for those who purchase Roku TV televisions.
    The patent centers around the idea of displaying ads on these TVs whenever they’re
    tuned to an HDMI input that’s paused or idle. Theoretically, this would allow
    Roku to present ads throughout your whole TV experience — and in places where
    it’s not viable to do so today. Your PS5, Xbox, Apple TV, or Blu-ray player could
    become yet another canvas for the company to continue growing its already-lucrative
    advertising business.

- en: According to the patent, the company would use a number of different clues to
    determine when an HDMI source is paused; the Roku TV could wait for extended audio
    silence or simply analyze the onscreen frames to gauge when movement has stopped,
    among other approaches. And the patent mentions using [automatic content recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_content_recognition)
    (ACR) to detect what you’re watching on an Apple TV (or playing on a console)
    to present with relevant ads. ACR is nothing new and one of those things that
    many of us agree to when quickly going through a new TV’s initial setup.

    your entertainment, and outrage customers. And a patent itself is no guarantee
    that this ads-on-every-HDMI-input concept will become reality. But it does follow
    a recent trend of streaming box (and stick) makers pushing right up against the
    line of what consumers are willing to tolerate — and testing whether they can
    quietly move the goalposts. Even [Microsoft is dabbling with the same](/2023/11/3/23945174/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-pop-up-ad-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-xbox-consoles).

    right at startup](/2023/12/1/23984444/amazon-fire-tv-autoplay-ads-on-startup)
    if a user took no immediate action. The move sure did [piss a lot of people off](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/17zgyt4/latest_update_on_firetv_causes_ads_to_immediately/)
    — but apparently not to enough of a level for the company to revert the change.
    You can avoid the autoplaying ads by disabling them in settings, but even then,
    sometimes you’ll see full-screen image banner slideshows.

    Not long after that, a Chromecast user spotted [this full-screen ad for chicken
    tender wraps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ae37sa/full_screen_video_ads_wtf/)
    from Carls Jr. Does the wrap look delicious? Absolutely. But this goes a step
    beyond the typical (and I’d say expected / acceptable) type of ads that we’re
    used to seeing. Sponsored “recommendations” for movies and shows have become quite
    common across TV platforms and streaming software. But a chicken wrap? C’mon.

    / 可接受的）。在电视平台和流媒体软件中，赞助的电影和节目“推荐”已经变得非常普遍。但是一个鸡肉卷？拜托了。

    the cheapest model. That’s a perfect example of where this ham-fisted advertising
    really rubs me the wrong way. What’s the point of getting the premium thing?

- en: This is why I almost always advise people to just spend the extra money on an
    Apple TV 4K. The reprieve from drowning in ads is well worth it. There are ways
    to circumvent ads on other devices, whether it’s Pi-hole, alternate launchers
    (on Android streamers), and more. But those are extra steps that most people will
    never take. And for them, the outlook keeps getting more bleak.

    by *Lowpass*. Roku TVs are often good! They’re dependable, get a long road of
    software updates, and feel instantly familiar to many people right out of the
    box. And I’m looking forward to checking out how a Roku Pro TV compares with today’s
    impressive Mini LED competition from TCL, Hisense, and more. But I’m not *confident*
    that the company won’t keep us speeding down [this trajectory of getting ads in

    takes the worst kind of inspiration from this patent.
