    has a bug interpreting declarations like `int a3[[(sizeof (unsigned char)) >=
    0]]`, so a cast to a `long int` is needed to get the correct number. Right, but
    that was in 2001, why are we forcing thousands of packages to do this unnecessary
    check? Maybe it’s already fixed. Even if it’s not, `SIZEOF_SIZE_T` is only used
    to compute `SIZE_MAX` if it’s not defined, which may be the case even in HP’s
    buggy C compiler. And this has nothing to do with `sizeof()` inside an array anyway.
    Even if `sizeof(size_t)` somehow failed, that’s a problem **for them**. If anyone
