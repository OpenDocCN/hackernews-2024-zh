- en: Rakuten Kobo is launching its first color e-readers, the [Kobo Libra Colour](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-libra-colour)
    and the [Kobo Clara Colour](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-colour).
    Both use E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which has subtle, pastel-like
    hues and drops from a 300ppi grayscale resolution to 150ppi when you view content
    in color.

- en: I’ll be testing both e-readers soon, but so far, they look like small upgrades
    to Kobo’s existing e-readers. That’s not a bad thing, though! The seven-inch Kobo
    Libra 2 is [my favorite e-reader](/23769068/best-ebook-readers) outside of Amazon’s
    ecosystem, offering the [Kindle Paperwhite’s](/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books)
    IPX8 waterproof design but with extras like physical page-turning buttons, no
    lockscreen ads, and more storage.

- en: The $219.99 Kobo Libra Colour retains all of those features but is also now
    compatible with the [Kobo Stylus 2](https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10733885674391-About-Kobo-Stylus-2#:~:text=Note%3A%20Kobo%20Stylus%202%20only,Elipsa%2C%20and%20Kobo%20Elipsa%202E.),
    just like the [Kobo Elipsa 2E](/2023/4/5/23669572/kobo-elipsa-2e-e-reader-tablet-kindle-scribe-onyx-remarkable).
    However, it’s $30 more expensive than the Kobo Libra 2, and you’ll have to buy
    the stylus separately for $69.99\.

- en: The $149.99 Kobo Clara Colour is slightly more distinct from its closest sibling,
    the $139.99 [Kobo Clara 2E](/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle).
    It offers the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design but now comes with
    16GB of storage, as well as an improved processor. I hope so; the Kobo Clara 2E’s
    sluggish performance was one of my chief complaints.

- en: Kobo also introduced an upgraded black-and-white Kobo Clara BW, with the same
    storage and processor upgrades, for $129.99.

    April 30th.
