    its move. The company has an initial nine months to sort out a deal, though the
    president could extend that another three months if he sees progress.

- en: While just recently the legislation seemed like it would stall out in the Senate
    after being passed as a standalone bill in the House, political maneuvering helped
    usher it through to Biden’s desk. The House packaged the TikTok bill — which upped
    the timeline for divestment from the six months allowed in the earlier version
    — with foreign aid to US allies, which effectively forced the Senate to consider
    the measures together. The longer divestment period also seemed to get some lawmakers
    who were on the fence on board.

    challenge the law in the courts, which could ultimately extend the timeline should
    the courts delay enforcement pending a resolution. There also remains the question
    of how China will respond and whether it would let ByteDance sell TikTok and,
    most importantly, its coveted algorithm that keeps users coming back to the app.

    and innovating to ensure TikTok remains a space where Americans of all walks of
    life can safely come to share their experiences, find joy, and be inspired,” Haurek
    said.

    on TikTok Wednesday, objecting to some lawmakers’ assertions that they just want
    to see the platform disconnected from Chinese ownership. “A ban on TikTok and
    a ban on you and your voice.”
