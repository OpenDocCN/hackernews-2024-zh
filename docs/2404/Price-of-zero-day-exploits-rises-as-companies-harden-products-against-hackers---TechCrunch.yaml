- en: Tools that allow government hackers to break into iPhones and Android phones,
    popular software like the Chrome and Safari browsers, and chat apps like WhatsApp
    and iMessage, are now worth millions of dollars — and their price has multiplied
    in the last few years as these products get harder to hack.

- en: On Monday, startup Crowdfense [published its updated price list](https://www.crowdfense.com/exploit-acquisition-program/)
    for these hacking tools, which are commonly known as “zero-days” because they
    rely on unpatched vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the makers of
    that software. Companies like Crowdfense and one of its competitors, Zerodium,
    claim to acquire these zero-days with the goal of reselling them to other organizations,
    usually government agencies or government contractors, which claim they need the
    hacking tools to track or spy on criminals.

- en: Crowdfense is now offering between $5 million and $7 million for zero-days to
    break into iPhones; up to $5 million for zero-days to break into Android phones;
    up to $3 million and $3.5 million for Chrome and Safari zero-days, respectively;
    and $3 million to $5 million for WhatsApp and iMessage zero-days.

    for Android and iOS zero-days.'

    are making it harder to hack their devices and apps, which means their users are

    whatever devices we’re using,” said Dustin Childs, who is the head of threat awareness
    at Trend Micro ZDI. Unlike Crowdfense and Zerodium, ZDI pays researchers to acquire
    zero-days, then reports them to the companies affected with the goal of getting
    the vulnerabilities fixed.

    like Google’s, and platform protections continue to improve, the time and effort
    required from attackers increases, resulting in an increase in cost for their
    findings,” said Shane Huntley, the head of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which
    tracks hackers and the use of zero-days.

    Spyware vendors, which often work with zero-day brokers, were responsible for
    75% of zero-days targeting Google products and Android, according to the company.'

    to find one or more zero-days and develop them into a full-fledged exploit targeting
    iPhones or Androids. Now, he said, “this thing is almost impossible,” as it requires
    a team of several researchers, which also causes prices to go up.

    of Russia, where a company called Operation Zero announced last year that it was
    willing to pay up to [$20 million for tools](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/) to
    hack iPhones and Android devices. The prices in Russia, however, may be inflated
    because of the war in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions, which could discourage
    or outright prevent people from dealing with a Russian company.

    at Linchpin Labs, a startup that focused on developing and selling zero-days.

    the FBI used a zero-day provided by a startup called Azimuth to break into the
    iPhone of one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, [according
    to The Washington Post](https://washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/).
    In 2020, [Motherboard revealed](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7gd9b/facebook-helped-fbi-hack-child-predator-buster-hernandez)
    that the FBI — with the help of Facebook and an unnamed third-party company —
    used a zero-day to track down a man who was later convicted for harassing and
    extorting young girls online.
