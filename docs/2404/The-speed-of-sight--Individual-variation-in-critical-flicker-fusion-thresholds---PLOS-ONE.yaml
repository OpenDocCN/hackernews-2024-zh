- en: The critical flicker fusion threshold is a psychophysical measure commonly used
    to quantify visual temporal resolution; the fastest rate at which a visual system
    can discriminate visual signals. Critical flicker fusion thresholds vary substantially
    among species, reflecting different ecological niches and demands. However, it
    is unclear how much variation exists in flicker fusion thresholds between healthy
    individuals of the same species, or how stable this attribute is over time within
    individuals. In this study, we assessed both inter- and intra-individual variation
    in critical flicker fusion thresholds in a cohort of healthy human participants
    within a specific age range, using two common psychophysical methods and three
    different measurements during each session. The resulting thresholds for each
    method were highly correlated. We found a between-participant maximum difference
    of roughly 30 Hz in flicker fusion thresholds and we estimated a 95% prediction
    interval of 21 Hz. We used random-effects models to compare between- and within-participant
    variance and found that approximately 80% of variance was due to between-individual
    differences, and about 10% of the variance originated from within-individual differences
    over three sessions. Within-individual thresholds did not differ significantly
    between the three sessions in males, but did in females (P<0.001 for two methods
    and P<0.05 for one method), indicating that critical flicker fusion thresholds
    may be more variable in females than in males.

- en: Visual perception is one of the most salient types of sensory processing found
    in the animal kingdom, with around 96% of known animal species alive today possessing
    image forming eyes [[1](#pone.0298007.ref001)]. Visual systems in nature are incredibly
    diverse and their specific functions and sensitivities vary greatly depending
    on a species’ ecological demands. However, all sensory processing is constrained
    by the maximum rate at which the system can parse information. This processing
    rate is different among species and is known as their temporal resolution [[2](#pone.0298007.ref002)–[4](#pone.0298007.ref004)].
    A finely tuned visual temporal resolution is necessary to respond appropriately
    to a dynamic environment and it determines a species’ ability to gauge how visual
    scenes change over time and how accurately it can detect rapid changes in light
    intensity. The processing of both spatial and temporal information is also crucial
    for motion perception, and the resolution with which this occurs may offer distinct
    benefits and drawbacks. A high temporal resolution may offer an increased ability
    to track fast-moving objects in high luminance conditions, whereas a lower temporal
    resolution might be more advantageous for the extrapolation of the direction of
    motion of slower objects and for increased temporal integration under low luminance
    conditions [[5](#pone.0298007.ref005),[6](#pone.0298007.ref006)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One commonly used method to quantify visual temporal resolution is with the
    critical flicker fusion (CFF) threshold: the point at which an intermittently
    flashing light flashes at such high a frequency, that individual flashes can no
    longer be discriminated and the light appears constant. An individual’s CFF threshold
    is dependent on the physical properties of the stimulus, such as its intensity,
    wavelength, size and its distance from the observer [[7](#pone.0298007.ref007)–[9](#pone.0298007.ref009)].
    As all visual systems rely on the integration and summation of luminous energy,
    CFF is applicable and generalizable across species, making it a useful proxy for
    visual temporal resolution research. Using simple experimental paradigms, CFF
    thresholds can also be determined in several ways: either behaviourally with trained
    animals, or electro-physiologically with electroretinograms.'

- en: As variation between individuals of the same species is present in many aspects
    of visual perception, we aimed to evaluate whether this is also the case for critical
    flicker fusion thresholds, using healthy human participants. CFF has been well
    studied in humans, and previous research has found that critical flicker fusion
    thresholds are affected by many physiological factors [[10](#pone.0298007.ref010)].
    For instance, different parts of our retina have different levels of sensitivity
    to flicker [[11](#pone.0298007.ref011),[12](#pone.0298007.ref012)]. Since flickering
    visual stimuli are processed by the nervous system, CFF thresholds may also be
    affected by impaired cerebral functioning [[13](#pone.0298007.ref013),[14](#pone.0298007.ref014)]
    and by neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease [[15](#pone.0298007.ref015)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain physiological stresses such as exercise or physical exhaustion may directly,
    but temporarily, affect an individual’s CFF threshold [[16](#pone.0298007.ref016)–[18](#pone.0298007.ref018)].
    It has also been suggested that CFF might be used as a measure for cortical arousal
    and central nervous system activity [[19](#pone.0298007.ref019)–[22](#pone.0298007.ref022)].
    Flicker fusion thresholds may even be affected by an individual’s blood oxygen
    content [[23](#pone.0298007.ref023)]. CFF thresholds also tend to be lower in
    older people than in younger people [[24](#pone.0298007.ref024)–[26](#pone.0298007.ref026)].

- en: Due to numerous external and internal factors that may affect CFF measurements,
    many different methods and techniques have been designed to quantify this trait,
    making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to compare study results directly.
    Some methods, such as the classical psychophysical “method of constant stimuli,”
    require a large number of repetitions of each stimulus to produce an accurate
    measure of performance, resulting in extremely long testing times and subsequently
    introducing fatigue as a possible confounding factor [[27](#pone.0298007.ref027),[28](#pone.0298007.ref028)].

- en: Additionally, CFF studies often rely on small sample sizes and thresholds are
    generally only reported as group averages, for example when assessing the effects
    of sex or age on CFF thresholds [[25](#pone.0298007.ref025),[29](#pone.0298007.ref029),[30](#pone.0298007.ref030)].
    Previous research has also placed considerable focus on how CFF thresholds may
    be affected by physiological or psychological phenomena, or by pharmacological
    intervention [[31](#pone.0298007.ref031)–[34](#pone.0298007.ref034)]. This research
    is valuable, but leaves the question of how much natural variation exists in CFF
    thresholds, and whether varying thresholds represent stable individual traits
    or more fluctuating variation due to other factors.

    consisting of an Arduino Uno R3 microprocessor and a standard 5mm diameter, round-lens
    4500K white LED light, housed in a black container. An opaque, black viewing tube
    and goggles with blacked out frames were mounted on top of the container, to standardize
    viewing distance at ~16 cm and to eliminate almost all ambient light. Flicker
    frequency of the LED could be adjusted with a rotary encoder dial that either
    increased or decreased flicker rate in 1 Hz increments ([Fig 1](#pone-0298007-g001)).
    We measured luminance and colour temperature with a ColorCal Mk II. Mean luminance
    of the LED was ~255 lux. The device was powered by a personal laptop, using a
    USBC cable. We measured the power input with a Tektronix TDS 210 oscilloscope
    to ensure stability. The precision and stability of the LED flash timings were
    measured using a photometer, both before the start of, and after completion of
    the study. Participants completed the task while seated, with the box placed in
    front of them on a desk. Participants were allowed to hold or tilt the box as
    needed to suit their comfort and to prevent neck- or back strain while operating
    the device.

    protocol consisted of a combination of two commonly used psychophysical experimental
    techniques: the method of limits (MOL) and the method of constant stimuli (MOC).
    As the method of limits generally produces a fast result, but the method of constant
    stimuli has a higher level of precision and stability [[27](#pone.0298007.ref027)],
    we combined the two methods to produce a protocol that took less than 10 minutes
    to complete. The MOL can be employed in two distinct manners (ascending and descending)
    and we used both, to give us three different CFF threshold values per participant,
    per session.'

    participants observed a constantly lit LED light through the viewing tube and
    were then instructed to turn the rotary encoder clockwise, to make the light source
    start flashing. Participants were then asked to keep rotating the dial to increase
    the flash frequency in 1 Hz increments until flashes could no longer be perceived
    and the light appeared steady. The frequency at which this occurred was recorded
    (ascending measurement). The LED light source was then set to a flash frequency
    of 65 Hz, which is above the threshold at which humans are generally able to perceive
    light flashes at the described intensity. For the second measurement, participants
    were instructed to observe the light source again, but this time they were asked
    to turn the dial counter-clockwise to decrease flash frequency, until they first
    observed flashing. The frequency at which this happened was again recorded (descending
    measurement). One participant indicated during one session that they were able
    to perceive flashing at the starting point of 65 Hz. For this session, the starting
    point was set to 80 Hz instead.'

    threshold, and 4 frequencies above it. Each of the frequencies in the series was
    then multiplied by 5 to produce a set of 50 stimuli. We then randomized the entire
    set and presented it to the participant. Participants were then instructed to
    cycle through all of the 50 frequencies in the series, one by one, using the rotary
    encoder dial to instantiate the next stimulus in the set. Participants were asked
    to inform the experimenter for each stimulus whether they observed a steady light
    or not. The final critical flicker fusion threshold for the individual was determined
    by calculating the highest frequency in the series at which the user was able
    to perceive flashing 80% of the time.'

    sex as a fixed effect and participant as random effect. As we hypothesized that
    the magnitude of within-participant variation might not be equal between participants,
    we performed the analyses using both random intercept and random slope models.
    The random slopes allow for different rates of change in CFF over the course of
    the three sessions. We used ANOVA to compare full (random slope and intercept)

    models AIC values were lower with sex included as a fixed variable. For the ascending
    MOL, AIC values were similar and removing the variable “sex” did not have an effect
    on the model (P = 0.29). Due to this possible effect of sex on the models, we
    conducted a post-hoc analysis of the multiple-measures data for each sex separately.
    We again created random slope fixed effects models with CFF threshold for each
    method as the response variable, session as explanatory variable, and participant
    as a random effect. This time, for all three methods, full models were no different

    Eisen-Enosh et al. also reported a slightly lower test-retest repeatability for

    can still provide an accurate result, while greatly reducing testing time. The
    ascending method of limits may be slightly more prone to extreme results. It is
    common in psychophysical paradigms to calculate a mean threshold from only an
    ascending- and a descending method of limits measurement [[27](#pone.0298007.ref027),[29](#pone.0298007.ref029),[39](#pone.0298007.ref039)],
    which may skew the results and may not represent an individual’s true CFF threshold
    if one of the values turns out to be an outlier. CFF thresholds may potentially
    be made more robust by adding the shortened version of the method of constant
    stimuli.

- en: Much of the existing literature relating to CFF compare measured thresholds
    to other physical and/or psychophysical attributes. Our study placed focus on
    variation in CFF thresholds both within- and between individuals of similar age.
    With this study, we have shown that there are considerable individual differences
    in CFF thresholds and that CFF is relatively stable over time. We found no significant
    difference in mean CFF thresholds between males and females, which is in agreement
    with previous findings [[25](#pone.0298007.ref025),[26](#pone.0298007.ref026),[40](#pone.0298007.ref040),[41](#pone.0298007.ref041)].
    However, the results from our post-hoc analysis do show a clear difference between
    sexes in the test-retest repeatability of CFF. This could be an indication that
    CFF might be more stable in males than in females, but replication studies are
    needed to further explore this possibility.

- en: As all participants in our study were within a small age range, had normal or
    corrected-to-normal visual acuity and all declared to be in general good health,
    the observed variation in CFF thresholds cannot be explained by variation in these
    factors. However, visual perception involves many physiological and psychological
    processes. It is therefore difficult to determine from where this variation might
    arise. For example, at the physical level, differences in the anatomy of the primary
    visual cortex can affect the processing of visual information [[42](#pone.0298007.ref042)].
    At the higher level of psychological processing, the formation of a percept and
    subsequently, the generation of a decision about that percept, also influence
    whether an individual determines they are perceiving a stimulus as constant or
    not-constant. Additionally, natural variation in brain wave oscillations may result
    in a difference in visual integration window sizes in different individuals [[43](#pone.0298007.ref043)].
  prefs: []

- en: The magnitude of the variation in CFF we found between individuals is quite
    large, and we calculated a prediction interval of roughly 21 Hz (± 10.6 Hz from
    the calculated mean). This amount of variation is comparable with the variation
    reported among closely related species that occupy different ecological niches,
    such as having habitats with different luminance levels [[44](#pone.0298007.ref044),[45](#pone.0298007.ref045)]
    or having a preference for faster or slower moving prey [[46](#pone.0298007.ref046)].
    This suggests that the spread of CFF thresholds in humans is in a range that could
    have important effects on function. It would therefore be interesting to explore
    how individual variation in visual temporal resolution in humans may translate
    to perception and behaviour in real-world scenarios, especially those requiring
    high-speed perception and action, such as athletic performance or competitive
    gaming.
