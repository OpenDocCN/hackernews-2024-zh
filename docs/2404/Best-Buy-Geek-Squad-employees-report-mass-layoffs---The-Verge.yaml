    fact that the company couldn’t afford to pay us, more or less. It was extremely
    short notice and devastating,” an ex-Geek Squad worker told *404 Media*.

    recently laid-off Geek Squad agents have posted [photos of their badges](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/1bwp1tn/dapc_103868_florida_going_sleeper/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
    in solidarity and referred to themselves as belonging to a Geek Squad “sleeper
    cell”, writing that they’re “going sleeper” along with their location and badge
    number.

    said to expect layoffs this year as part of a push to “redirect corporate resources
    to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other
    elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to
    see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result
    of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership
    benefits.”

    spending on electronics, including a drop in sales following heightened demand
    during the pandemic, and that, “honestly, really, right now, there isn’t any massive
    current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop.”

    “Our fiscal ‘25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across
    forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer
    care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology
    to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.”
    Another area she’s looking at is health, mentioning [Best Buy Health](https://www.bestbuyhealth.com/)
    as an area “where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to
    capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health care in the
    home.”

    Best Buy “[will be removing physical media](/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray)
    and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets, and smart home departments.”

    the [high turnover rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/tdmsew/high_turnover_rate_because_of_pay/)
    associated with the job due to its relatively low pay and slim prospects of promotion.
    Based on 231 salaries, Glassdoor estimated a [pay range](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Best-Buy-Geek-Squad-Agent-Hourly-Pay-E97_D_KO9,25.htm)
    of $16-$21 per hour for a Geek Squad agent. This estimate appears to be accurate
    based on the listed open roles on Best Buy’s website. For example, there’s currently
    an active listing for a “Geek Squad City Supervisor” in [Brooks, Kentucky](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941721BR),
    with an hourly pay range of $20-$30 per hour. An opening for an entry-level Geek
    Squad agent at a store in [Encinitas, California](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941802BR),
    has an hourly pay range of $15-$19 per hour.
