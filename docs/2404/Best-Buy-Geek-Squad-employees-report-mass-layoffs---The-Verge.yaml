    fact that the company couldn’t afford to pay us, more or less. It was extremely
    short notice and devastating,” an ex-Geek Squad worker told *404 Media*.

    recently laid-off Geek Squad agents have posted [photos of their badges](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/1bwp1tn/dapc_103868_florida_going_sleeper/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
    in solidarity and referred to themselves as belonging to a Geek Squad “sleeper
    cell”, writing that they’re “going sleeper” along with their location and badge

    said to expect layoffs this year as part of a push to “redirect corporate resources
    to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other
    elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to
    see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result
    of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership
    benefits.”

    spending on electronics, including a drop in sales following heightened demand
    during the pandemic, and that, “honestly, really, right now, there isn’t any massive
    current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop.”

    “Our fiscal ‘25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across
    forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer
    care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology
    to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.”
    Another area she’s looking at is health, mentioning [Best Buy Health](https://www.bestbuyhealth.com/)
    as an area “where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to
    capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health care in the
    home.”

    Squad维修运营以及客户关怀体验的效率。我们将继续大力依赖分析和技术来实现这些效率提升。这包括安全有效地利用人工智能。” 她还关注的另一个领域是健康，提到了[Best
    Buy Health](https://www.bestbuyhealth.com/)，这是一个“我们正在利用我们的专业知识和Geek Squad代理人，利用不断增长的技术来提供家庭健康护理”的领域。
- en: That “rightsizing” also includes the physical space in stores, where she confirmed
    Best Buy “[will be removing physical media](/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray)
    and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets, and smart home departments.”

  zh: 这种“权益调整”还包括店铺内的物理空间，她确认Best Buy “[将移除实体媒体](/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray)并更新我们的移动数字成像、计算、平板电脑和智能家居部门。”
- en: Numerous former and current Geek Squad employees on Reddit over the years noted
    the [high turnover rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/tdmsew/high_turnover_rate_because_of_pay/)
    associated with the job due to its relatively low pay and slim prospects of promotion.
    Based on 231 salaries, Glassdoor estimated a [pay range](https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Best-Buy-Geek-Squad-Agent-Hourly-Pay-E97_D_KO9,25.htm)
    of $16-$21 per hour for a Geek Squad agent. This estimate appears to be accurate
    based on the listed open roles on Best Buy’s website. For example, there’s currently
    an active listing for a “Geek Squad City Supervisor” in [Brooks, Kentucky](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941721BR),
    with an hourly pay range of $20-$30 per hour. An opening for an entry-level Geek
    Squad agent at a store in [Encinitas, California](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941802BR),
    has an hourly pay range of $15-$19 per hour.

  zh: 多年来，Reddit上的众多前和现任Geek Squad员工指出，由于相对较低的薪资和晋升前景不明朗，该岗位存在[较高的员工流动率](https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/tdmsew/high_turnover_rate_because_of_pay/)。根据231份薪资数据，Glassdoor估计Geek
    Squad代理人的时薪范围为$16至$21。根据Best Buy网站上列出的在招职位，这一估计看起来是准确的。例如，目前在[Kentucky州布鲁克斯](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941721BR)招聘一名“Geek
    Squad城市监督”，时薪范围为$20至$30。在[加利福尼亚州Encinitas](https://jobs.bestbuy.com/bby?id=job_details&req_id=941802BR)，一名初级Geek
    Squad代理人的时薪范围为$15至$19。
