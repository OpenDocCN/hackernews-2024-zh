    the technology in a U.S. criminal court, according to a February filing in King
    County Superior Court. Jonathan Hak, a solicitor and barrister in Canada and an
    expert on image-based evidence in the United States and elsewhere, said this was
    the first case he was aware of where a criminal court had weighed in on the matter.

    case but had a background in creative video production and editing, according

    reflect the size, shape, edges and color captured in the original video. The enhanced

    analyst who reviewed the original and enhanced recordings said the enhanced version
    contained visual data that was not in the original. Data had also been removed
    from the enhanced version, according to the expert, Grant Fredericks.

    appear more pleasing to the eye of a lay observer, but which contains the illusion
    of clarity and increased image resolution that does not accurately represent the
    events of the original scene,” Fredericks wrote in the declaration.

    and overblown.” A comparison of the two videos shows the enhanced version is a
    “faithful depiction of the original,” the filing says. “And that is what matters.”

    someone uses it in actual case work. It should be peer-reviewed. I’m not certain
    what level is going to be appropriate at some time in the future for the use of
    AI in actually doing a clarification of a still photograph or a video, but at
    this particular point it’s premature.”
