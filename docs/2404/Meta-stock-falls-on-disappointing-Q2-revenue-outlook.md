Meta Platforms ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META?.tsrc=fin-srch)) reported first quarter earnings of $4.71 per share, well above analyst estimates of $4.30\. Revenue was about in line with expectations, $36.46 billion compared to the $36.12 billion estimate.

For the second quarter, the social media giant sees revenue of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Analysts were expecting $38.24 billion of revenue in the quarter, which means the midpoint of the range is a disappointment to the Street.
