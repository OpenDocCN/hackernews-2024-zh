- en: Today we’re announcing $18M in new funding from an incredible set of investors,
    with a $17M Series A-1 round led by Spark Capital, with Buckley Ventures, Anzu
    Partners, Cooler Master, and Pathbreaker Ventures participating. We started just
    over four years ago with a vision to remake consumer electronics to respect people
    and the planet. We chose to take on the notebook space first to prove that it’s
    possible to fix even the most mature, competitive categories with an excellent
    product that is simple to repair, upgrade, and customize. We’ve continued to increase
    our sales and market share substantially each year as the industry broadly has
    struggled. It’s clear that our commitment to longevity is resonating. It’s ultimately
    your belief in our mission and products that drives our success.

- en: When we closed a [Series A round](https://frame.work/blog/frameworks-series-a-and-the-years-ahead)
    two years ago, we shared our strategy around fundraising, which is to raise as
    little as possible and focus funds on efficiently expanding the reach of our mission.
    You can now see the results of that investment with Framework Laptop 16 out in
    customers’ hands. With this new round, we’re continuing to deepen support for
    our existing customers, scaling the reach of our current products, and extending
    to additional product categories that let us empower new consumers and businesses. Ultimately,
    we need for everyone in the world to have the option for a longer-lasting product,
    no matter the category.

    connections and expertise. We chose each of our new investors based on their belief
    in our mission, the strengths of their teams, the companies they work with, and
    the reach of their networks. We’ve had a number of early partnership discussions
    with other startups in our investors’ portfolios, and we’re excited to share more
    about this as we deliver on the results. Cooler Master is a key strategic partner-turned-investor,
    having been both the supplier for our Framework Laptop 16 thermal system and the
    first company to join the Framework ecosystem with a compatible product, [a case](https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case)
    that enables Framework Laptop Mainboard reuse. We have additional collaborations
    with the Cooler Master team in incubation now.

    other: the Framework community. The third most common question we’ve gotten since
    starting Framework (after “[AMD when?](https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd?q=processor)”
    and “[Upgradeable graphics when?](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040)”)
    is “Can I invest in Framework?”. The answer is finally… possibly. In addition
    to the $17M of funds we’ve raised from traditional investors, we’re raising a
    $1M community round to enable 100 of you to invest $10,000 each in Framework.
    Investing in startups is approximately the riskiest place imaginable to put your
    money, and statistically, the most likely outcome for any individual early-stage
    startup investment is for it to become worthless. With that in mind, for both
    moral and regulatory reasons, we’re limiting participation to individuals and
    entities that meet the [SEC’s Accredited Investor](https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/accredited-investor)
    qualifications. This also allows us to publicly share the existence of this fundraising
    under the [SEC’s 506(c) regulations](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/rule506c).
    If you qualify as an Accredited Investor, believe in our mission and strategy,
    and are interested in investing in this round, you can get more details and apply
    [here](https://frame.work/community-round).'

    team! To actually drive the growth that our new funding enables, we’re adding
    a few key roles across Framework, including a Product Marketing Manager and a
    Supply Chain Manager. You can check out all of our open roles on our [careers
    page](https://jobs.frame.work). We’re eager to fix this industry together as quickly
    as we can.
