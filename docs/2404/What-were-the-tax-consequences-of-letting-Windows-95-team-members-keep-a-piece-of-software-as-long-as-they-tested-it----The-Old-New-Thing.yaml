- en: Every so often, somebody rediscovers my story of [buying an entire Egghead Software
    store](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050824-11/?p=34463). One question
    that comes up is the issue of taxes. (You can never avoid taxes. Taxes are due
    today for most people in the United States.)

  zh: 偶尔会有人重新发现我关于[购买整个Egghead Software商店的故事](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050824-11/?p=34463)。其中一个问题是税收问题。（大多数美国人今天都要交税。）
- en: If the employees were allowed to keep the software provided they tested the
    program and filed bugs against it, did that count as work compensation that became
    taxable income?

  zh: 如果员工们被允许保留软件，前提是他们测试了程序并提交了错误报告，那么这是否算作工作补偿，从而成为应纳税收入？
- en: 'The thing is, nobody ever checked whether you tested the program you took,
    and it was obvious to everybody participating in the activity, seeing as you just
    picked up the software and walked out of the room without filling out any paperwork.
    You were assumed to be a well-meaning member of the team who wouldn’t show up
    for an activity without any intention of doing it. The expectation that you test
    the program was just that: An expectation. It wasn’t a condition.'

  zh: 事实上，没有人核实过你是否测试了你拿走的程序，对于参与活动的每个人来说都是显而易见的，因为你只是拿起软件走出房间，没有填写任何文件。你被认为是团队的好成员，不会出现没有打算做的活动。测试程序的期望只是期望而已，不是条件。
- en: My understanding is that this makes the software count as a gift that falls
    under the *de minimis* rule of the United States tax code. This was a one-time
    thing, so the frequency criterion is met. The value of the software was well under
    $100, so that requirement was met. And since nobody actually kept track of who
    took which software, the administrative impracticality requirement was also satisfied.

  zh: 我的理解是，这使得软件被视为美国税法*de minimis*规则下的一份礼物。这是一次性的事情，因此满足频率标准。软件的价值远低于100美元，因此也满足了这一要求。而且由于没有人实际跟踪谁拿了哪个软件，因此也满足了行政不切实际的要求。

- en: '**Bonus chatter**: During one of the many iterations of this story being retold,
    someone remarked that they got a copy of the video game *Wing Commander III* through
    this exercise. I immediately remembered that they fulfilled their expectation
    by filing a bug against Windows 95: When you earned the cloaking device on level
    58 or something, you couldn’t activate it.'

  zh: '**额外的闲聊**：在这个故事的多次重述中，有人提到他们通过这个活动得到了一份《星际争霸III》的拷贝。我立刻记起，他们通过对Windows 95提交错误报告的方式达到了他们的期望：当你在58级或者什么地方获得了隐形装置时，你无法激活它。'

    all the way to level 58 by myself.

- en: The problem was that the hotkey for activating the cloaking device was `Ctrl`+`C`,
    and that conflicted with the use of `Ctrl`+`C` to cancel an active clipboard paste
    operation into an MS-DOS session. Normally, Windows 95 realized that there was
    no active paste active and replayed the hotkey into the MS-DOS session. However,
    the replay of the hotkey was apparently too fast for this game to recognize, so
    it never activated the cloaking device.

  zh: 问题在于激活隐形装置的热键是`Ctrl`+`C`，这与在MS-DOS会话中取消活动剪贴板粘贴操作的`Ctrl`+`C`冲突。通常情况下，Windows
    95会意识到没有活动的粘贴操作，然后重新播放热键到MS-DOS会话中。然而，热键的重播显然对这款游戏来说太快了，所以它从未激活隐形装置。
- en: I fixed it by changing Windows 95 so that it installed the `Ctrl`+`C` hotkey
    handler only when a clipboard paste operation was active, and removed it when
    the paste operation completed. That way, when you hit it outside of a paste operation,
    the keys were visible to the game at human speeds, and this allowed it to engage
    the cloaking device.

  zh: 我通过改变 Windows 95 来修复了这个问题，使得它只在剪贴板粘贴操作活跃时安装`Ctrl`+`C`热键处理程序，并在粘贴操作完成后将其移除。这样，当你在粘贴操作之外按下它时，按键会以人类速度显示给游戏，从而使其能够启动隐身装置。
