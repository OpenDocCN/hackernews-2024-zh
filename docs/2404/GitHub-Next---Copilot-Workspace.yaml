    the system via natural language: by altering the specification, and by altering
    the plan.'

- en: 'When you prompt Copilot Workspace to make a change, it start by reading your
    codebase and generating a specification. The spec is comprised of two bullet-point
    lists: one for the current state of the codebase, and one for the desired state.
    You can edit both lists, either to correct the system’s understanding of the current
    codebase, or to refine the requirements for the desired state.'

- en: Once you’re happy with the spec, Copilot Workspace will generate a concrete
    plan for executing the changes. In this step, it will list out every file it intends
    to create, modify, or delete, as well as a bullet-point list of the actions to
    be taken in each file. Once again, you can edit any part of this plan — altering
    the specific instructions, or even changing the list of files that will be affected.

    code before creating a pull request or pushing the code to a branch.

    from scratch. Simply edit the spec or plan at any point, and Copilot Workspace
    will regenerate all the downstream steps with your new input.
