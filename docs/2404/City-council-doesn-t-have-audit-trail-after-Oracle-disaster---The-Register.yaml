    yesterday that the council would almost certainly never know if fraud had been

    somewhere … to switch off the one thing that could give us the assurance within
    the control environment of the ERP system [means that] I''m probably going to
    be in a position where I can never give that 100 percent assurance … that trail
    is just not there," she said.'

- en: The council's Oracle Fusion ERP system, which replaced an aging system from
    German vendor SAP, went live in April 2022\. The cost of implementing a functioning
    system that allows external auditors to sign off accounts is expected to be more
    than £100 million more than initial estimates. In September last year, the [council
    was effectively declared bankrupt](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/05/birmingham_city_council_oracle/)
    because of the Oracle implementation and a string of equal pay claims going back
    a number of years, the bill for which has been estimated up to £760 million.

    would be difficult "because the audit trail was not switched on until August [or]
    September, which means we have at least half a year of transactions with no audit
    trail and ability to test for fraud in that system. So that's a concern."

    from when the system was first introduced. "Some IT security systems were not
