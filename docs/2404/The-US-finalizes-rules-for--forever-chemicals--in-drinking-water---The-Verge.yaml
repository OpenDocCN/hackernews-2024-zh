    for the amount of certain “forever chemicals” allowed in drinking water. This
    is the first time the US has placed legally enforceable federal limits on per-
    and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals so ubiquitous that they’ve likely
    already made their way [into most Americans’ bloodstreams](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/us-population.html).

- en: Under the EPA’s new rules, public water systems will be required to test drinking
    water and make sure levels of the five kinds of regulated PFAS stay below mandated
    thresholds. The limit is 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS, the two most
    common types of forever chemicals, and 10 parts for trillion for the other three
    types of PFAS. Noting “the latest science showing that there is no level of exposure
    to these contaminants without risk of health impacts, including certain cancers”
    in a [press release](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard),

    higher than the new regulations, according to the NRDC. The EPA estimates that
    up to 10 percent of the nation’s 66,000 public drinking water systems may have
    to treat water or find new water supplies in order to fall in line with the new
    standards. Public water systems will have three years to sample their water and
    notify the public about PFAS levels and five years to implement plans to lower
    the amount of forever chemicals if they run afoul of the new regulations.
