    CEO Tony Aquila’s private jet — just one of many expenses that illustrates the
    gap between spending and revenue at the EV startup.

- en: Canoo posted Monday its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings for 2023 in a
    [regulatory filing](https://ir.stockpr.com/canoo/sec-filings-email/content/0001628280-24-014075/goev-20231231.htm#i5cf4fcff5f5a4438b15ae9a52ca671ee_112)
    that shows a company burning through cash as it tries to scale up volume production
    of its commercial electric vehicles and avoid the same fate as other EV startups,
    like recently bankrupt [Arrival](https://techcrunch.com/tag/arrival/). The regulatory
    filing once again contained a “going concern” warning — which has [persisted since
    2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/canoo-warns-it-may-not-have-enough-funds-to-bring-evs-to-market/)
    — as well as some progress on the expenses and revenue fronts.

    in 2022, as the company delivered 22 vehicles to entities like NASA and the state
    of Oklahoma. And it did reduce its loss from operations by nearly half, from $506
    million in 2022 to $267 million in 2023\. The revenue-to-losses gap is still considerable
    though: The company reported total net losses of $302.6 million in 2023.'

- en: Still, one only needs to look at what Canoo is paying to rent the CEO’s private
    jet to put those “wins” into perspective. Under a deal reached in November 2020,
    Canoo reimburses Aquila Family Ventures, an entity owned by the CEO, for use of
    an aircraft. In 2023, Canoo spent $1.7 million on this reimbursement — that’s
    double the amount of revenue it generated. Canoo paid Aquila Family Ventures $1.3
    million in 2022 and $1.8 million in 2021 for use of the aircraft.

    million in 2022 and $500,000 in 2021 for shared services support in its Justin,
    Texas, corporate office facility, according to regulatory filings.

    forecast for 2024 of $50 million to $100 million.
