- en: Several decades after the [Sutton Hoo burial](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/05/national-trust-brings-sutton-hoo-alive-with-4m-revamp),
    starting in about AD660, there was a sudden rise in the number of silver coins
    in circulation in England, for reasons that have long puzzled archaeologists and
    historians.

    of the new towns springing up at the time – but where did it come from? Were the
    Anglo-Saxon kings recycling old Roman scrap metal? Or had they found lucrative
    sources from mines in Europe?

    power brokers of the time were melting down their stockpiles of Byzantine silver
    treasures, in a type of early medieval quantitative easing that kickstarted the
    economy of [England](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england) and established
    a monetary system that would last for a millennium.'

- en: Chemical analysis of coins from the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has revealed
    two distinct phases of the silver rush. For almost a century from the 660s, coins
    were minted from silver bullion that originated in the Byzantine empire on the
    eastern Mediterranean. Then, after stocks of those treasures were drying up in
    about 750, silver from a mine in western France came to predominate across Europe,
    during the reign of Charlemagne.

    a professor of early medieval English history at the University of Cambridge,
    one of the academics behind the study. “Now we have the first [archaeometric](https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/archaeometry#:~:text=Archaeometry%20is%20an%20international%20research,archaeology%2C%20anthropology%20and%20art%20history.)
    confirmation that Byzantine silver was the dominant source behind the great seventh-century
    surge in minting and trade around the North Sea.”

    £20-£30 today – which formed “the bedrock of the English economy” until at least

    decades or more old – most likely it had been prized as a way to display its owner’s
    power and wealth. The ruler honoured at [Sutton Hoo](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/suffolk/sutton-hoo/history-of-sutton-hoo),
    thought to be Raedwald of East Anglia, was buried with a collection of Byzantine
    silver bowls and other items which, if melted down, could have made 10,000 pennies,
    the authors say.

    associate professor at Oxford University’s school of archaeology and the study’s
    lead author. “We know of some surviving Byzantine silver from Anglo-Saxon England,
    most famously from Sutton Hoo, but far greater amounts of Byzantine silver must
    have originally been held in Anglo-Saxon stores.”

    in valuable objects and using that silver to make coins that then circulated widely.
    It would have had a big impact on people’s lives. Far more people than before
    would have used coined money and thought in terms of monetary values.”'

    “There wasn’t a Bank of England at this stage – if you want some coins, you make
    some coins. You just need to be someone who’s got the wealth to do it.”

- en: By the middle of the eighth century, however, the silver pennies were becoming
    lighter and made with less silver as stocks of the Byzantine bullion ran low.
    Around this time, the researchers found, it was increasingly replaced with silver
    from a mine at Melle, in western France.

    really important to the economy [of this period]. It shows that if people in England
    wanted to have a complex economy with currency, they couldn’t just rely on the
    resources at home – they needed to deal with people in the Mediterranean, in France,
    in all sorts of other places.
