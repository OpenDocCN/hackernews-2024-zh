    which she presented at a major cancer conference, showed that Asian women had
    a higher lung cancer detection rate than the original national trial — 1.5% versus

    “It’s extraordinary that screening in this population yielded a similar incidence

    inclusion of Asian American women in the screening guidelines is still a long
    way off, with many more studies needed to confirm and build on Shum’s findings.
