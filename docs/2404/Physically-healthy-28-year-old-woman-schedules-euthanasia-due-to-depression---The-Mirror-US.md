A fit and [healthy](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/health) young [woman](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/people) who struggles with crippling [depression](https://www.themirror.com/all-about/mental-health), autism and borderline personality disorder will end her life with euthanasia.

Zoraya ter Beek, 28, lives in a small village in the Netherlands close to the German border and has decided to take her own life with assisted suicide in May, according to a reporter. Zoraya has struggled with her mental health her whole life and currently has a 40-year-old boyfriend she loves and her two cats.

She once dreamed of becoming a psychiatrist but is now set to end her life later in the year after finding out about the method when visiting the doctors who apparently told her: “There’s nothing more we can do for you. It’s never gonna get any better."

Zoraya explained: “I was always very clear that if it doesn’t get better, I can’t do this anymore." Stef Groenewoud, a health care ethicist at Theological University Kampen in the Netherlands, said: “I’m seeing euthanasia as some sort of acceptable option brought to the table by physicians, by psychiatrists, when previously it was the ultimate last resort.

“I see the phenomenon especially in people with psychiatric diseases, and especially young people with psychiatric disorders, where the health care professional seems to give up on them more easily than before."

Zoraya is planning to be cremated after she is euthanized on the sofa in her living room. She's explained she doesn't want any sort of music during the event. A doctor will first administer a sedative followed by a drug that will stop her heart. Her boyfriend will be at her side, the [NY Post reports](https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/world-news/28-year-old-woman-decides-to-be-euthanized-due-to-mental-health-issues/).

She said: “The doctor really takes her time. It is not that they walk in and say, ‘Lay down, please!’ Most of the time it is first a cup of coffee to settle the nerves and create a soft atmosphere.

“Then she asks if I am ready. I will take my place on the couch. She will once again ask if I am sure, and she will start up the procedure and wish me a good journey. Or, in my case, a nice nap, because I hate it if people say, ‘Safe journey.’ I’m not going anywhere.”

The 28-year-old doesn't have much family, so explained her boyfriend will find a nice spot in the woods to spread her ashes. She continued: “I’m a little afraid of dying, because it’s the ultimate unknown. We don’t really know what’s next — or is there nothing? That’s the scary part.”

The Netherlands became the [first country](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1269682.stm) in the world to make assisted suicide legal in 2001\. Since then, it’s become an increasingly popular option. In 2022, there were 8,720 euthanasia deaths in the Netherlands — representing roughly 5% of all the country’s deaths and up from 4% from the year before. In February, the 93-year-old former Dutch Prime Minister Dries van Agt and his wife were euthanized.

Critics of suicide legalization say that people like Ter Beek have been encouraged to kill themselves by the law, with some likening the suicide surge to a contagion. 

Speaking about the original media outlet she explained her choice to, Zoraya said: “It was an honor for me to provide insights to people who were open to learning something." Later she announced she would be leaving social media ahead of her death.
