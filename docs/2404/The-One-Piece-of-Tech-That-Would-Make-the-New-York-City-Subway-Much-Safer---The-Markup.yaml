    the subway system is relatively safe, based on the available evidence. More than
    [three million riders](https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/subway-bus-ridership-2022)
    take the train each day, and the vast majority do so without incident. According
    to a recent New York Times analysis of data from mid-2022, there was around one
    violent crime per one million rides on the subway. Since then, the Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/nyc-subway-crime.html?searchResultPosition=7)
    that “the overall crime rate has fallen and ridership has increased, making the
    likelihood of being a victim of a violent crime even more remote.”

    On Wednesday, the NYPD [announced a reduction in subway crimes](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0101/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-march-first-quarter-2024),
    saying overall transit crime fell almost 24 percent in the first quarter of 2024\.
    Officials credited the reduction in reported incidents to additional officers
    working in the transit system.

    week, Adams announced the city would pilot gun detectors—yes, a lot like metal
    detectors but for guns—in the subway. The trial is the latest in a series of tech
    solutions that Adams, a former cop, is exploring for subway safety: Last September,
    Adams [announced](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/23/new-york-city-police-robot/70945317007/)
    a pilot program with Knightscope, a company that makes autonomous security robots,
    at Times Square, the busiest of the subway’s 472 stations. The robot, which weighs
    more than 400 pounds, is equipped with a camera to record images and videos. It
    also has a call button to report incidents.'

    sprawling, 3,920-page report](https://new.mta.info/document/73241) on its yearslong
    feasibility study for platform screen doors in February 2020\. Turns out station
    platform widths, space for accessibility clearance, multiple train car types,
    limited height, and structural integrity of platform edges are among the factors
    complicating a full rollout of platform screen doors in such an old system. The
    agency estimated that system-wide feasibility for a platform screen door program
    is 27%, or 128 of the 472 stations.

    just those 128 stations would be over $7 billion, the agency found, and half-height
    gates would cost $6.53 billion. Once installed, the agency would have to spend
    more than $119 million each year to maintain the doors.

    [installed earlier this year](https://new.mta.info/press-release/mta-installs-platform-barriers-191-st-1-station)
    in one station in Manhattan. These barriers, which are bolted to the ground, aren’t
    mechanically operated: they don’t slide open or closed, so one can still fall
    or be pushed through the open space at the platform edge. Sadly, in a timeline
    where we may one day have gun detectors and massive robots patrolling underground,
    these steel fences appear to be the best tool we have to curb preventable subway
    deaths.'
