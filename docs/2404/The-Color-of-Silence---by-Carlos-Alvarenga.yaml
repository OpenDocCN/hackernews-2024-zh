    walked onstage at the Maverick Concert Hall in Woodstock, NY, to premiere a new
    composition by the American experimental composer [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage)
    (1912–1992). Tudor sat at the piano and opened the keylid, after which he did
    nothing until he closed it over a minute later. He repeated this sequence twice,
    at which point the performance, which had taken four minutes and thirty-three
    seconds, was finished.

    disbelief. Most people did not understand what they had just witnessed, and some
    did not realize anything had actually happened. Reaction to Cage’s piece was swift
    and largely critical, with many people calling it a musical joke or even an insult.
    Half a century later, when the BBC broadcast a [performance](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3401901.stm)
    of what became known as *4’33”*, the following listener reaction spoke for many:
    “I’ve never heard of such a stupid thing in my life! God rest his soul, but this
    ‘composition’ by Cage smacks of arrogance and self-importance.” Another listener
    was slightly more generous: “It sounds a great deal better than the majority of
    music that is sold today.”'

    silence, because they didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds.
    You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the
    second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves
    made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.

    it performed again today, I sense that he wanted the audience to listen to itself
    and its surroundings to accomplish two goals. First, to reveal the sounds that
    are hidden during a typical performance. Second, to highlight the sonic contribution
    of the audience, a phenomenon that goes unremarked unless it becomes intrusive.
    Why force an audience to focus on these hidden sounds for over four minutes? I
    like critic [Kyle Gahnn’s answer](https://newmusicusa.org/nmbx/from-no-such-thing-as-silence-john-cages-433/)
    to that question:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How about a “thought experiment,” a kind of “metamusic” that makes a statement
    about music itself? For many people, including me, *4′33″* is certainly that,
    if not only that. One story about Cage recounts his sitting in a restaurant with
    the painter [Willem de Kooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning),
    who, for the sake of argument, placed his fingers in such a way as to frame some
    bread crumbs on the table and said, “If I put a frame around these bread crumbs,
    that isn’t art.” Cage argued that it indeed *was* art, which tells us something
    about *4′33″.* Certainly, through the conventional and well-understood acts of
    placing the title of a composition on a program and arranging the audience in
    chairs facing a pianist, Cage was *framing* the sounds that the audience heard
    in an experimental attempt to make people perceive as art sounds that were not
    usually so perceived.

    in bars, cafés, restaurants, shops, leaking from other people’s headphones, even
    my bank, often at a volume which precludes comfortable speech or hearing, and
    which invades our conscious, creating unwanted “earworms” or aggravating my tinnitus.
    It seems that there is some unseen force which requires us to have a soundtrack
    for every moment of our day. In contrast, *4’33”* impels us to to take time out
    to listen, and *really listen*.

    listen to itself (and only itself) and, by doing so, contemplate a space with
    and without music. As interesting as Cage’s famous composition is, there is a
    much more obscure work that I find more provocative and exciting to consider.
    It was created by the French [conceptual artist](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art)  [Yves
    Klein](https://www.yvesklein.com/en/bio/) (1928–1962), who is most remembered
    in art and fashion for his remarkable signature color, [International Klein Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Klein_Blue)
    (“IKB”).

    two exhibitions of monochrome paintings he staged in 1955 and 1956\. The public
    did not understand his paintings, the art writer Phillip Barcio [notes](https://www.ideelart.com/magazine/international-klein-blue),
    seeing them as “decoration rather than as abstract expressions of pure emotion.”
    For his next show, Klein decided to work with only one color that would be invented
    for the occasion. He collaborated with Parisian paint store owner [Edouard Adam](https://www.lyonne.fr/montholon-89110/actualites/conseiller-et-ami-de-grands-artistes-du-xxe-edouard-adam-a-une-maison-a-aillant-sur-tholon_1180189/),

    pure blue possible](https://www.ideelart.com/magazine/international-klein-blue).”

- en: Klein’s musical composition, in two movements, is called *Monotone Silence Symphony*.
    In the first movement, an orchestra and choir create “one unique continuous ‘sound,’
    drawn out and deprived of its beginning and of its end.” That sound, a D major
    chord, is held continuously without adornment or variation for twenty minutes.
    The second movement is of equal duration but consists only of the orchestra sitting
    in silence, instructed to remain still and make no movements. Because no singer
    or standard orchestra instrument can hold a note for twenty minutes, to perform
    the piece, the D major is transferred back and forth from one group of paired
    instruments to the other, taking care to make the transition as seamless as possible.
    The conductor is the only performer allowed to move in the second movement.

    “we weren’t so much receiving the music as we were being bound up in it (and in
    the silence, which was also the music).” It was, she added, “like an ocean . .
    . tidal. In and out. Coming and going.” For me, the moment when the D major sound
    stops is a unique sonic experience. It is as if the waters of a deep blue sea
    I had been floating on for twenty minutes suddenly disappeared, and I dropped
    to its bottom. Standing in the abyss, I finally comprehend the sea’s vastness
