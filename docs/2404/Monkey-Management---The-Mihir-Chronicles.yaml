- en: Harvard Business Review in 1974 published “Who's Got the Monkey” authored by
    William Oncken Jr and Donald L. Wass. The article described unsolved problems
    of employees which are delegated upwards causing the “monkey” to jump on a manager's
    back. This increases workload for a manager.

  zh: 1974年，《哈佛商业评论》发表了由威廉·昂肯和唐纳德·沃斯合著的文章《谁拿到了猴子》，描述了员工委托上升的未解决问题，导致“猴子”落在经理的身上。这增加了经理的工作负担。
- en: This analogy struck me hard. I have taken my own spin on the analogy and applied
    to my world of product management. Product managers do not own a team, but they
    manage sideways, upwards and downwards. If we are not good at monkey management,
    we can lose track of time and individual autonomy. It would be easier for Engineering,
    Design, and Leadership to target product team for being a bottleneck.

  zh: 这个类比对我影响深远。我在这个类比上加了自己的理解，并将其应用于我的产品管理世界。产品经理并不拥有团队，但他们需要在横向、纵向和下向管理中出色。如果我们在猴子管理上做得不好，很容易失去时间和个人自主权。对于工程、设计和领导来说，指责产品团队成为瓶颈会更容易。

    is broadcasted to an entire organization, and Product team will be responsible
    for executing that strategy. They will need help from Design and Engineering.
    Design will explore solutions and help understand the *usability* of a solution.

  zh: 领导团队决定致力于一个关键战略倡议。该战略对整个组织广播，并由产品团队负责执行。他们需要设计和工程的帮助。设计部门将探索解决方案并帮助理解*解决方案的可用性*。工程部门将探索*解决方案的可行性*。需要在业务的其他功能之间进行协调。但为了简单起见，我们就到此为止。

    need further clarification. Product can decide to de-prioritize or influence for

    the system. Additionally, this will optimize the system for future needs, but
    pushing the launch date by several quarters.

  zh: 与上述情况相同，但工程部门回来说，他们可以按照设计提出的解决方案进行，同时满足所有产品要求，但需要重新架构系统。此外，这将为未来的需求优化系统，但会将推迟推出日期几个季度。
- en: Where is the monkey now? Is it the Product, Engineering or both? And is it known

  zh: 现在猴子在哪里？是产品部门、工程部门还是两者兼而有之？而且，是否已知这是一个共同的问题？还是因为产品部门不允许时间来重构代码和优化数据库，难以避免责备之战。
- en: Product is in dilemma because neither business nor clients care about system
    re-architecture, but it is critical to maintain technology systems for scale and
    growth. Engineering is looking for a green light on moving forward because everything
    else will need to be paused. Why is Engineering looking for approval? It is the
    business that provides funding to Engineering department.

  zh: 产品部门陷入困境，因为业务和客户都不关心系统的重新架构，但是对于维持技术系统以实现规模和增长至关重要。工程部门希望能够获得前进的绿灯，因为其他所有事情都需要暂停。为什么工程部门需要批准？因为业务向工程部门提供资金支持。
- en: Product needs to communicate this up the chain. Product cannot singularly make
