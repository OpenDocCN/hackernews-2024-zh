    proposes a shared digital currency for the BRICS nations - Brazil, Russia, India,
    China and South Africa. The BRICS currency aims to integrate with the existing
    monetary systems of the member nations, creating a unified economic area and exchange
    market. The value of the BRICS currency is derived algorithmically by combining
    various economic factors of the member nations. While the article suggests the
    impossibility of realizing such currency as a cryptocurrency, in this text we
    challenge this claim. We explore how using a public blockchain with smart contracts
    is not only feasible, but a natural match. By further combining this with Zero-Knowledge
    Proof (ZKP) protocols like zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs, an additional layer of privacy,
    legal compliance, and interoperability is added. Although ZKPs can be used outside
    of the blockchain, their practical value is maximized when combined with the blockchain.

    significantly simplifies the creation of derivatives. By tying the value of the

    instrument that reflects the collective economic strength of the BRICS bloc. The

    decentralized financial system, where the control over the currency is distributed
    among the member nations. This presents a sharp contract to the majority of existing
    financial infrastructure, where the control over the currency is centralized in
    the hands of a single entity, such as a central bank or a government.

    BRICS” can be implemented as a cryptocurrency on a smart-contract enabled public
    blockchain. Such an approach not only reduces the cost and the complexity of the
    implementation, expands its utility and reach, but also presents a move towards
    a fully decentralized and trustless global financial system. The blockchain provides
    a verifiable computational model, where every participant can be sure that rules
    encoded within the smart contracts are followed. This means that the participants
    don’t need to trust each other to perform their obligations, both at an individual
    level, and at the group level. My [article zkSNARKs & zkSTARKs: A Novel Verifiable

    details of the BRICS digital currency as described in the article, using it will
    empower it with several benefits. First, it will further reduce the complexity
    and cost of the implementation. Second, it will trivialize its interoperability
    not only with other blockchains, but also “legacy” systems, such as the COBOL-based
    systems still in use by many banks, and Web 2\. Third, it will enable a realm

    For example, in the realm of DeFi it means that it’s possible to publicly perform
    a monetary transaction without revealing neither the identities of the partipants,
    nor the amounts, while still allowing anyone to verify such a transaction does
    not violate any national or international laws. When I say “anyone”, I don’t just
    mean only the participating BRICS nations, but really anyone: you, me or even
    an IoT device. If we use ZKP protocols like zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs, we can express
    this verification in just a couple of kilobytes of data, instead of requiring
    to download and store hundreds of gigabytes of blockchain data to perform a single
    verification. This is precisely how [zkLocus](https://zklocus.dev/%22) leverages
    the [Mina Blockchain](https://minaprotocol.com) to provide a geolocation as a

    be used to verifiably and privately bridge data from any digital source. The demand
    derives from the incentives created for participating in the BRICS economic network.

    similar approaches. You may be familiar with Uniswap V2’s `x*y=k` formula, which
    algorithmically defines the price of assets in the pool. The daily trading volume

    of U.S. dollars in value. These same, empirically-proved mechanisms can be employed

    bridge its data onto other blockchains. zkLocus geolocation proofs are raw zkSNARK
    proofs, and as such they themselves can be directly used by other blockchains.
    As such, integration with zkLocus can be done by either bridging data from the
    Mina blockchain, or by verifying zkLocus proofs directly on the blockchain of
    choice. Integrating through Mina has the benefit of using the on-chain’s protocol
    features such it’s native token **$ZKL** and bounties, which allow for the incentivization
    of submission of zkLocus proofs on-chain, thus enabling to outsource the on-chain
    data compression and submission to third-parties. This presents a tremendous benefit
