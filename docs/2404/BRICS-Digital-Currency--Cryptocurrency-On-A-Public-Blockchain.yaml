    proposes a shared digital currency for the BRICS nations - Brazil, Russia, India,
    China and South Africa. The BRICS currency aims to integrate with the existing
    monetary systems of the member nations, creating a unified economic area and exchange
    market. The value of the BRICS currency is derived algorithmically by combining
    various economic factors of the member nations. While the article suggests the
    impossibility of realizing such currency as a cryptocurrency, in this text we
    challenge this claim. We explore how using a public blockchain with smart contracts
    is not only feasible, but a natural match. By further combining this with Zero-Knowledge
    Proof (ZKP) protocols like zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs, an additional layer of privacy,
    legal compliance, and interoperability is added. Although ZKPs can be used outside
    of the blockchain, their practical value is maximized when combined with the blockchain.

    incentives for the currency, such as location-based fees and taxation, which can

    from the collective economies of the member nations and their local currencies.
    This requires a dynamic BRICS currency supply that adjusts based on the economic
    performance of each participating country. As such, the **economic value of the
    BRICS currency is a derivative of the economic value of the member nations**.
    This **economic value** is defined by a formula, which will will explore in the
    next section.

    increases, the supply of the BRICS currency will increase proportionally. Conversely,
    if the economic value decreases, the supply will decrease. In essence, the BRICS
    currency can be viewed as a derivative of the joint economic state of its member
    countries. As I’ve previously explored in [DeFiDe, my ETHLisbon 2023 hackathon
    project](https://github.com/iluxonchik/eth-lisbon-hackathon-23), blockchain technology
    significantly simplifies the creation of derivatives. By tying the value of the
    BRICS currency to the economic performance of member nations, it becomes a derivative
    instrument that reflects the collective economic strength of the BRICS bloc. The
    term *bloc* refers to a group of countries with common interests who have formed
    an alliance. So, the *BRICS bloc* refers to the member countries of the BRICS
    acting together for their mutual benefit.'

    with the most obvious one being the decentralization of the currency supply, as
    it’s governed by a multiple entities, instead of a single one. This also allows
    to hedge the risk and reduce volatity at larger scale than of existing FIAT currencies.
    An economic downturn in one country can be offset by growth in another. This is
    in contrast to the local currencies, where their value and supply is generally
    controlled by single entity, either in the form of a central bank or a government.

    chage the core fact of the value of something being defined by the **ratio between
    the supply and demand**. Let’s say you live in an isolated town, and you are the
    firt person to have an orange tree. The people in your town love the fruit, and
    the tree produces more than you consume, so you decide to sell your oranges. The
    supply of oranges is limited, as you tree can only produce a limited number of
    oranges per season. What determines the value of your oranges is the demand for
    the oranges in your town. If the town experiences an increase in demand for the
    oranges, then that demand will drive the amount of value people are willing to
    exchange for your oranges up. In other words, they’re willing to pay more for
    your oranges. As such, an increase in demand, without a corresponding increase
    in supply, will lead to an increase in the value of the oranges.

    your neighbour decides to plant an orange tree as well. Now, there are two people
    in town who have orange trees. The supply of oranges has increased, but the demand
    has stayed the same. Even if the previous clients are still willing to pay the
    same price for the oranges, the amount of those clients is limited, and those
    clients will purchase a limited amount of oranges. Some people aren’t willing
    to pay a price higher above a certain amount for the oranges. As such, this will
    leave you and your neighbour in a situation where you either don’t profit from
    the remaining oranges that you have, or you lower the price on the oranges, thus
    being able to address the demand for a new sector of the market: one that is only
    willing to pay a lower price for the oranges. As such, an increase in supply,
    without a corresponding increase in demand, will lead to a decrease in the value
    of the oranges.'

    oranges increases proportionally. In this case, the value of the oranges will
    remain unchanged. The BRICS currency supply formula aims to maintain a constant
    or increasing value of the currency, while having a dynamic supply. This is achieved
    by adjusting the supply based on the economic performance of the member nations,
    ensuring that the value of the BRICS currency reflects the underlying economic
    value of the BRICS bloc.

    Foreign trade surges as exports rise, foreign direct investment pours in, and
    portfolio investments in BRICS financial markets soar. The foreign exchange reserves
    of the BRICS central banks, including their gold holdings, expand significantly.
    In this scenario, the BRICS currency supply formula would compute a higher value
    for M, leading to an increase in the circulating supply of the digital currency.
    This expansion in supply aims to reflect the increased economic value of the BRICS
    bloc, thus the increased demand for the BRICS currency, since the bloc both, operates
    on that currency and defines its value.

    volumes contract, foreign investments are reduced, and capital outflows increase.
    Central bank reserves are drawn down to support local currencies. In this situation,
    the currency supply formula would result in a lower value for M, triggering a
    contraction in the BRICS digital currency supply. This reduction helps offset
    the decreased demand and economic activity, thus reducing or preventing devaluation
    of the BRICS currency.

    is backed by gold, it means that the supply of that currency is a direct reflection
    fo the underlying collateral in gold. In practice, this means that that a unit
    of that currency is convertible to a fixed amount of gold. This not only provides
    extra stability to the currency, but also serves as a hedge against inflation.
