    or starting competing businesses — are especially prevalent in the world of tech,
    where we’ve seen companies like Amazon [enforce](/2023/1/5/23540953/ftc-noncompete-ban-proposal)
    and then [retract](/2015/3/27/8303229/amazon-reverses-noncompete-contract-rules)
    a noncompete agreement for warehouse workers. [Acer even sued](/2012/2/7/2781962/acer-former-ceo-gianfranco-lanci-noncompete-lawsuit)

    notify employees about the change. Existing noncompete agreements for senior executives
    can stay in place, but companies can’t enter or enforce new agreements. (The FTC
    defines senior executives as workers in “policy-making” decisions who earn more
    than $151,164 annually.)

    including trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements. “Noncompete clauses
    keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism,” FTC
    Chair Lina Khan says in a statement.

    in January 2023 and estimates that around 30 million workers are currently locked
    into one. The agency says the ban will lead to the creation of over 8,500 businesses
    each year while also lowering healthcare costs and raising compensation for workers.
    The new rule will go into effect 120 days after it’s published in the Federal
    Register.
