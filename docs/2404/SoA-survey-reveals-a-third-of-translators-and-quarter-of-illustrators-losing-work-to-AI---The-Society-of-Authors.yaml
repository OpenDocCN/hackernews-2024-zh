    receiving nearly 800 responses on respondents’ experiences of generative artificial
    intelligence (AI) systems, and their views and concerns about the future impact
    on creative careers.

- en: The generative AI landscape has evolved fast. Two years ago, these were niche
    systems but they have quickly become global, mass-market products. We raised concerns
    then about the possible future impact on creative careers. Today, that impact
    is already felt acutely by more and more creators – from translators and illustrators
    to journalists and educational writers. No one expects generative AI to be un-invented,
    and we all know its potential to be a powerful and useful tool. But it is not
    too late to ensure that it is developed and used ethically, and within existing
    copyright frameworks. Once the world moves beyond the wow factor of each new system
    release, generative AI must remain a tool to *support and enhance* human-made
    creative work, not a cheap alternative to replace it.
