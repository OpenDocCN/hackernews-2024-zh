    Mathematics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542234/), published with MIT Press
    2021, an introduction to the philosophy of mathematics with an approach grounded
    in mathematics, arising organically from mathematical inquiry and practice. This
    book was used as the basis of my lecture series on the philosophy of mathematics
    at Oxford University.

- en: Now that we have established Dedekind's categoricity result for arithmetic,
    let us discuss the philosophical position known as *structuralism*, in one form
    perhaps the most widely held philosophical position amongst mathematicians today.
    Contemporary structuralist ideas in mathematics tend to find their roots in Dedekind's
    categoricity result and the other classical categoricity results characterizing
    the central structures of mathematics, placing enormous importance on the role
    of isomorphism-invariance in mathematics. Much of the philosophical treatment
    of structuralism, meanwhile, grows instead out of Benacerraf's influential papers
    (1965, 1973).

- en: The main idea of structuralism is that it just does not matter what numbers
    or other mathematical objects are, taken as individuals; what matters is the structures
    they inhabit, taken as a whole. Numbers each play their structural roles within
    a number system, and other mathematical objects play structural roles in their
    systems. The slogan of structuralism, according to Shapiro (1996, 1997), is that
    “mathematics is the science of structure.”

- en: A defining structural role played by the number zero in any copy of the ring
    of integers ℤ is that it is the additive identity. It also happens to be the unique
    additive idempotent, the only number *z* for which *z* + *z* = *z*; it is the
    only additively self-inverse number *z* = -*z*; and it is the smaller of the two
    multiplicative idempotents. So in general, there can be many ways to characterize
    the role played by a mathematical object. In the rational numbers ℚ, the number
    1/2 is the only number whose sum with itself is the multiplicative identity 1/2
    + 1/2 = 1\. In the real field ℝ, the defining structural role played by √2 is
    that it is positive and its square is equal to 2, which is 1 + 1, where 1 is the
    multiplicative identity.

    on real-closed fields, after all, implies that the number π, being transcendental,
    is not definable in the real field ℝ by any property expressible in the language
    of ordered fields. Yet it still plays a unique structural role, determined, for
    example, by how it cuts the rational numbers into those below and those above;
    only it makes exactly that same cut.

    if it has a property φ(*a*) in *M* that it alone has — a property expressible
    in terms of the structural relations of *M*, which picks out this object a uniquely.
    This is relevant for structuralism, because the definition φ specifies explicitly
    the structural role played by the object in that structure. A structure is *pointwise
    definable* if every object in it is definable in this way.

    that is pointed at by a node that is not pointed at by any node (namely, 2 is
    pointed at by 1, which is not pointed at at all); and node 4 is the unique node
    that is pointed at by a node, yet does not itself point at any node. In fact,
    every node in this graph is characterized by a property expressible in terms of
    the pointing-at relation, so this graph is pointwise definable. A mathematical
    structure is *Leibnizian*, in contrast, if any two distinct objects in the structure
    can be distinguished by some property. In other words, a Leibnizian structure
    is one that fulfills Leibniz's principle on the *identity of indiscernibles* with
    respect to properties expressible in the language of that structure.
  prefs: []

- en: Every pointwise definable structure is Leibnizian, since the defining properties
    of two different objects will distinguish them. But the notions are distinct.
    For example, the real ordered field ⟨ℝ, + , · ,<,0,1⟩ is Leibnizian, since for
    any two distinct real numbers *x* < *y*, there is a rational number *p*/*q* between
    them, and *x* has the property that *x* < *p*/*q*, while *y* does not, and this
    property is expressible in the language of ordered fields. But this structure
    is not pointwise definable because there are only countably many possible definitions
    to use in this structure, but uncountably many real numbers, so they cannot all
    be definable.

- en: Every Leibnizian structure must be *rigid*, meaning that it admits no nontrivial
    automorphism, because automorphisms are truth-preserving — any statement true
    of an individual in a structure will also be true of its image under any automorphism
    of the structure. If all individuals are discernible, therefore, then no individual
    can be moved to another. Because of this, we should look upon the Leibnizian property
    as a strong form of rigidity. These two concepts are not identical, however, because
    there can be rigid structures that are not Leibnizian. Every well-order structure,
    for example, is necessarily rigid, but when an order is sufficiently large — larger
    than the continuum is enough — then not every point can be characterized by its
    properties, simply because there aren't enough sets of formulas in the language
    to distinguish all the points, and so it will not be Leibnizian. Indeed, for any
    language ℒ, every sufficiently large ℒ-structure will fail to be Leibnizian for
    the same reason.

- en: The *rigid relation principle*, introduced and investigated by Hamkins and Palumbo
    (2012), is the mathematical principle asserting that every set carries a rigid
    binary relation. This is a consequence of the well-order principle, because well-orders
    are rigid, but it turns out to be strictly weaker; it is an intermediate weak
    form of the axiom of choice, neither equivalent to the axiom of choice nor provable
    in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice.

- en: The nature of Leibnizian structures is often sensitive to the question of whether
    one has included the equality or identity relation x = y in the formal language.
    In contemporary approaches to model theory and first-order logic, it often goes
    without saying that equality is included as a logical relation in every language
    and interpreted in every model as actual equality. This is ultimately a convention,
    of course, and one can easily and sensibly undertake a version of model theory
    without treating equality in this special manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When one omits equality from the language, then every model is elementarily
    equivalent to a model that violates the Leibnizian principle on the identity of
    indiscernibles. Specifically, for any model *M* in a language without equality,
    consider a new model *M** obtained by adding any number of duplicate elements
    for any or all of the elements of *M*, defining the atomic relations for the duplicates
    in the new structure *M** in accordance with the original structure. For example,
    in the rational order ⟨ℚ, ⩽ ⟩, we might consider the order ⟨ℚ*, ⩽ ⟩ in which every
    rational number has two copies, each less-than-or-equal to the other and ordered
    with the other elements as one would expect, so that both copies of 0, for example,
    are less than any of the copies of positive elements, and so on. It follows inductively
    that any equality-free statement φ(*a*[0],...,*a[n]*) true of individuals in *M*
    will also be true in *M** of any of their duplicates φ(*a*[0]*,...,*a[n]**). In
    particular, the structure *M** will not be able to discern an individual from
    its copies, and so this structure will not be Leibnizian if indeed any nontrivial
    duplication occurred. Furthermore, the two models have exactly the same equality-free
    truth assertions; they are elementarily equivalent in that language. (Meanwhile,
    with equality we can distinguish the models, since ⩽ is anti-symmetric in ℚ, meaning
    that

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The philosophical point to make about this is that one can never expect a theory
    to give rise to the Leibnizian principle of identity of indiscernibles, unless
    the language includes the equality relation explicitly. In particular, nothing
    you say about a nonempty structure can possibly ensure that it is Leibnizian,
    unless equality is explicitly mentioned, since the structure has all the same
    equality-free assertions as the corresponding structure in which every individual
    has been duplicated.

- en: While definability and even discernibility are sufficient for capturing the
    structural roles played by an object, they are not necessary, and a fuller account
    will arise from the notion of an isomorphism orbit. Specifically, two mathematical
    structures *A* and *B* are *isomorphic* if they are copies of one another, or
    more precisely, if there is an *isomorphism* π:*A* → *B* between them, a one-to-one
    correspondence or bijective map between the respective domains of the structures
    that respects the salient structural relations and operations. For example, an
    order isomorphism of linear orders ⟨*L*[1], ⩽[1]⟩ and ⟨*L*[2], ⩽[2]⟩ is a bijection
    π:*L*[1] → *L*[2] between the domains of the orders that preserves the order structure
    from one to the other, meaning that *x* ⩽[1]  *y* if and only if π(*x*) ⩽[2] π(*y*).
    An isomorphism of arithmetic structures ⟨*Y*,+,·⟩ and ⟨*Z*,⊕,⊗⟩ is a bijection
    τ:*Y* → *Z*, for which τ(*a* + *b*) = τ(*a*) ⊕ τ(*b*) and τ(*a* · *b*) = τ(*a*)
    ⊙ τ(*b*), translating the structure from *Y* to *Z*. Every mathematical structural
    conception is accompanied by a corresponding isomorphism concept.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The isomorphism concept is intricately linked with that of formal language,
    which is a way of making precise exactly which mathematical structure one is considering.
    Whether a given one-to-one correspondence is an isomorphism depends crucially,
    after all, on which structural features are deemed salient. Is one considering
    the rational numbers only as an order, or as an ordered field? A given bijection
    may preserve only part of the structure.

    of *A* with *B* carrying *a* to *b*.

    the theory completely captures the structural essence of what it is trying to
    describe, characterizing that structure up to isomorphism. Dedekind, for example,
    had isolated fundamental principles of arithmetic and proved that they characterized
    the natural numbers up to isomorphism; any two models are isomorphic. In other
    words, he proved that his theory is categorical.

    mathematical structures, and we have categorical characterizations not only of
    the natural numbers ℕ, but of the ring of integers ℤ, the field of rational numbers
    ℚ, the field of real numbers ℝ, the field of complex numbers ℂ, and many more
    (see sections 1.11 and 1.13). Daniel Isaacson (2011) emphasizes the role that
    categoricity plays in identifying particular mathematical structures. Namely,
    we become familiar with a structure; we find the essential features of that structure;
    and then we prove that those features axiomatically characterize the structure
    up to isomorphism. For Isaacson, this is what it means to identify a particular
    mathematical structure, such as the natural numbers, the integers, the real numbers,
    or indeed, even the set- theoretic universe.

- en: Categoricity is central to structuralism because it shows that the essence of
    our familiar mathematical domains, including ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, and so on, are determined
    by structural features that we can identify and express. Indeed, how else could
    we ever pick out a definite mathematical structure, except by identifying a categorical
    theory that is true in it? Because of categoricity, we need not set up a standard
    canonical copy of the natural numbers, like the iron rod kept in Paris that defined
    the standard meter; rather, we can investigate independently whether any given
    structure exhibits the right structural features by investigating whether it fulfills
    the categorical characterization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Invariably, for deep reasons, these categorical characterizations use second-order
    logic, meaning that their fundamental axioms involve quantification not only over
    the individuals of the domain, but also over arbitrary sets of individuals or
    relations on the domain. Dedekind's arithmetic, for example, asserts the induction
    axiom for arbitrary sets of natural numbers, and we shall see in section 1.11
    that Dedekind's completeness axiom for the real numbers involves quantifying over
    arbitrary bounded sets of rational numbers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The deep reasons are that a purely first-order theory, one whose axioms involve
    quantification only over the domain of individuals in a structure rather than
    over arbitrary sets of individuals, can never provide a categorical characterization
    of an infinite structure. This is a consequence of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem,
    which shows that every first-order theory that is true in an infinite model is
    also true in models of diverse infinite cardinalities, which therefore cannot
    be isomorphic. Meanwhile, the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem does not apply to second-order
    theories, and it should be no surprise to find second-order axioms in the categorical
    theories characterizing our familiar mathematical structures.

- en: Some philosophers object that we cannot identify or secure the definiteness
    of our fundamental mathematical structures by means of second-order categoricity
    characterizations. Rather, we only do so relative to a set-theoretic background,
    and these backgrounds are not absolute. The proposal is that we know what we mean
    by the structure of the natural numbers—it is a definite structure—because Dedekind
    arithmetic characterizes this structure uniquely up to isomorphism. The objection
    is that Dedekind arithmetic relies fundamentally on the concept of arbitrary collections
    of numbers, a concept that is itself less secure and definite than the natural-number
    concept with which we are concerned. If we had doubts about the definiteness of
    the natural numbers, how can we assuaged by an argument relying on the comparatively
    indefinite concept of “arbitrary collection”? Which collections are there? The
    categoricity argument takes place in a set-theoretic realm, whose own definite
    nature would need to be established in order to use it to establish definiteness
    for the natural numbers.

    a form of structuralism that is widespread amongst mathematicians—a form which
    I call *structuralism in practice*. Structuralism in practice involves an imperative
    about how to undertake mathematics, a view about which kinds of mathematical investigations
    will be fruitful. According to the structuralist-in-practice, mathematics is about
    mathematical structure, and mathematicians should state and prove only structuralist
    theorems in a structuralist manner. All of one's mathematical concepts should

    becomes invariant under isomorphism; one should be able to replace the real numbers
    with any other complete ordered field, while preserving the truth of the theorem.

    about the countable random graph if one takes this term to refer to any countable
    graph with the finite pattern property, a feature that characterizes these graphs
    up to isomorphism. One might prove, for example, that the countable random graph
    is homogeneous or that it has diameter two or an infinite chromatic number; what
    this really means is that all such countable graphs with the finite pattern property
    have these features. Because the hypothesis is invariant under isomorphism, we
    do not care which particular copy of the countable random graph we are using,
    and this is the heart of structuralism.

    *n*th binary digit of *m* is 1; this graph happens to exhibit the finite pattern
    property, and therefore it is a specific instance of the countable random graph

    of the countable random graph. In this sense, it might seem that structuralism
    in practice requires only that one's theorems are structuralist, that is, that
    they are properly invariant under isomorphism.

    using nonstructural details of one's specific interpretation instances, even when
    they might seem convenient. The reason is that those details never lie at the
    core of the mathematical phenomenon—they are always a distraction—precisely because
    they cannot matter for the structuralist conclusion of the theorem. If you have
    a proof of an isomorphism-invariant theorem that uses incidental details of a
    specific instantiation, then the mathematical structuralist will say that you
    have a poor argument; you have missed the essential point; and your argument will
    not produce mathematical insight. In this sense, the structuralist imperative
    is a recommendation about mathematical efficacy. Namely, by undertaking structural
    arguments, we will stay closer on the trail of mathematical truth.

    if one was concerned with some of the extra structure inherent in that particular
    presentation of this graph. For example, the edge relation of the Rado graph is
    a computably decidable relation on the natural numbers, but not every copy of
    the countable random graph on the natural numbers is computably decidable. In
    this case, one is not really studying the countable random graph, with only its
    graph structure, but rather one is studying computable model theory, looking at
    the computational complexity of presentations of this graph. This is again structural,

    It would be antistructuralist for a program to use details of how a particular
    piece of data is represented on a particular system, to peek into the internal
    coding of data in the machine; this sneaky way of getting at the data might work
    fine at first, but it often causes portability issues because the methods can

    in particular structures. Eliminative structuralism includes the nominalist claim
    that there is no abstract object that is the mathematical structure itself, beyond
    representations in particular instantiations. There is no abstract thing that
    is “the number 3”—any object can play that role in a suitable structure—and so
    talk of numbers and other particular mathematical objects is merely instrumental.
    Shapiro (1996) says, “Accordingly, numerals are not genuine singular terms, but

    of mathematics, including numbers, functions, and sets, are inherently structural;
    they exist as purely structural abstract objects, positions within a structure,
    locations in a pattern of arrangement that might be realized in diverse instantiations.
    The quarterback is a position on an American football team, the role played by
    the person who calls the play, receives the hike and makes the passes. Each individual
    quarterback is a person rather than a position — a person who plays the role of
    quarterback on a particular team. Similarly, the natural number 3 is the third
    successor “location” in the natural number structure — the position that any particular
    copy of 3 fills in any particular instantiation of the natural numbers. On this

    also argues, much like Maddy in the egg carton argument (mentioned on page 21),
    that abstract structuralism offers a solution to Benacerraf''s epistemological
    problem: we gain access to finite instances of abstract structures and then proceed
    by abstraction to the structure itself.'

- en: The abstract structuralist is providing a structuralist account of mathematics
    by realizing mathematical objects as purely structural. Yet, the structuralist-in-practice
    will say that this form of abstract structuralism is not structuralist at all—it
    violates the structuralist imperative—precisely because it is concerned with what
    the mathematical objects are, even if the answer it provides is that they are
    purely structural. According to the structuralist-in-practice, such concerns are
    misguided; they never elucidate a mathematical phenomenon and are irrelevant for
    mathematical insight. The structuralist-in-practice will happily consider any
    classification invariant of the isomorphism orbit relation, such as the orbit
    itself (akin to Frege taking numbers as equinumerosity classes), without the need
    for a purely structural abstract object representing the structural role.

- en: Yet, the abstract structuralist may reply, “Fine, we do not pursue abstract
    structuralism for mathematical insight, but rather as a philosophical investigation
    in mathematical ontology, aiming to understand what mathematical structure really
    is.” The abstract structuralist seeks to identify and elucidate the essential
    nature of mathematical objects, a philosophical effort rather than a mathematical
    one. The abstract structuralist seeks to give an account of what structure *is*—the
    thing that the mathematicians take to be so fundamental.
