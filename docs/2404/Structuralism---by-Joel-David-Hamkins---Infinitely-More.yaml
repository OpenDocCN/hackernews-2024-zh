- en: Now that we have established Dedekind's categoricity result for arithmetic,
    let us discuss the philosophical position known as *structuralism*, in one form
    perhaps the most widely held philosophical position amongst mathematicians today.
    Contemporary structuralist ideas in mathematics tend to find their roots in Dedekind's
    categoricity result and the other classical categoricity results characterizing
    the central structures of mathematics, placing enormous importance on the role
    of isomorphism-invariance in mathematics. Much of the philosophical treatment
    of structuralism, meanwhile, grows instead out of Benacerraf's influential papers
    (1965, 1973).

- en: The main idea of structuralism is that it just does not matter what numbers
    or other mathematical objects are, taken as individuals; what matters is the structures
    they inhabit, taken as a whole. Numbers each play their structural roles within
    a number system, and other mathematical objects play structural roles in their
    systems. The slogan of structuralism, according to Shapiro (1996, 1997), is that
    “mathematics is the science of structure.”

- en: A defining structural role played by the number zero in any copy of the ring
    of integers ℤ is that it is the additive identity. It also happens to be the unique
    additive idempotent, the only number *z* for which *z* + *z* = *z*; it is the
    only additively self-inverse number *z* = -*z*; and it is the smaller of the two
    multiplicative idempotents. So in general, there can be many ways to characterize
    the role played by a mathematical object. In the rational numbers ℚ, the number
    1/2 is the only number whose sum with itself is the multiplicative identity 1/2
    + 1/2 = 1\. In the real field ℝ, the defining structural role played by √2 is
    that it is positive and its square is equal to 2, which is 1 + 1, where 1 is the
    multiplicative identity.

    on real-closed fields, after all, implies that the number π, being transcendental,
    is not definable in the real field ℝ by any property expressible in the language
    of ordered fields. Yet it still plays a unique structural role, determined, for
    example, by how it cuts the rational numbers into those below and those above;
    only it makes exactly that same cut.

    if it has a property φ(*a*) in *M* that it alone has — a property expressible
    in terms of the structural relations of *M*, which picks out this object a uniquely.
    This is relevant for structuralism, because the definition φ specifies explicitly
    the structural role played by the object in that structure. A structure is *pointwise
    definable* if every object in it is definable in this way.

    that is pointed at by a node that is not pointed at by any node (namely, 2 is
    pointed at by 1, which is not pointed at at all); and node 4 is the unique node
    that is pointed at by a node, yet does not itself point at any node. In fact,
    every node in this graph is characterized by a property expressible in terms of
    the pointing-at relation, so this graph is pointwise definable. A mathematical
    structure is *Leibnizian*, in contrast, if any two distinct objects in the structure
    can be distinguished by some property. In other words, a Leibnizian structure
    is one that fulfills Leibniz's principle on the *identity of indiscernibles* with
    respect to properties expressible in the language of that structure.

- en: Every pointwise definable structure is Leibnizian, since the defining properties
    of two different objects will distinguish them. But the notions are distinct.
    For example, the real ordered field ⟨ℝ, + , · ,<,0,1⟩ is Leibnizian, since for
    any two distinct real numbers *x* < *y*, there is a rational number *p*/*q* between
    them, and *x* has the property that *x* < *p*/*q*, while *y* does not, and this
    property is expressible in the language of ordered fields. But this structure
    is not pointwise definable because there are only countably many possible definitions
    to use in this structure, but uncountably many real numbers, so they cannot all
    be definable.

    < *y*，存在一个有理数*p*/*q*介于它们之间，而*x*具有*x* < *p*/*q*的属性，而*y*没有，这种属性可以在有序域的语言中表达出来。但这个结构不是逐点可定义的，因为在这个结构中只有可数多个可能的定义，但实数却是不可数多的，因此它们不能都被定义出来。
- en: Every Leibnizian structure must be *rigid*, meaning that it admits no nontrivial
    automorphism, because automorphisms are truth-preserving — any statement true
    of an individual in a structure will also be true of its image under any automorphism
    of the structure. If all individuals are discernible, therefore, then no individual
    can be moved to another. Because of this, we should look upon the Leibnizian property
    as a strong form of rigidity. These two concepts are not identical, however, because
    there can be rigid structures that are not Leibnizian. Every well-order structure,
    for example, is necessarily rigid, but when an order is sufficiently large — larger
    than the continuum is enough — then not every point can be characterized by its
    properties, simply because there aren't enough sets of formulas in the language
    to distinguish all the points, and so it will not be Leibnizian. Indeed, for any
    language ℒ, every sufficiently large ℒ-structure will fail to be Leibnizian for
    the same reason.

    — 大于连续体就足够了 — 那么不是每个点都可以通过其属性进行表征，简单地因为在语言中没有足够多的公式集来区分所有的点，因此它不会是莱布尼兹的。事实上，对于任何语言ℒ，每个足够大的ℒ-结构都因同样的原因而无法成为莱布尼兹结构。
- en: The *rigid relation principle*, introduced and investigated by Hamkins and Palumbo
    (2012), is the mathematical principle asserting that every set carries a rigid
    binary relation. This is a consequence of the well-order principle, because well-orders
    are rigid, but it turns out to be strictly weaker; it is an intermediate weak
    form of the axiom of choice, neither equivalent to the axiom of choice nor provable
    in ZF set theory without the axiom of choice.

- en: The nature of Leibnizian structures is often sensitive to the question of whether
    one has included the equality or identity relation x = y in the formal language.
    In contemporary approaches to model theory and first-order logic, it often goes
    without saying that equality is included as a logical relation in every language
    and interpreted in every model as actual equality. This is ultimately a convention,
    of course, and one can easily and sensibly undertake a version of model theory
    without treating equality in this special manner.
  id: totrans-split-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When one omits equality from the language, then every model is elementarily
    equivalent to a model that violates the Leibnizian principle on the identity of
    indiscernibles. Specifically, for any model *M* in a language without equality,
    consider a new model *M** obtained by adding any number of duplicate elements
    for any or all of the elements of *M*, defining the atomic relations for the duplicates
    in the new structure *M** in accordance with the original structure. For example,
    in the rational order ⟨ℚ, ⩽ ⟩, we might consider the order ⟨ℚ*, ⩽ ⟩ in which every
    rational number has two copies, each less-than-or-equal to the other and ordered
    with the other elements as one would expect, so that both copies of 0, for example,
    are less than any of the copies of positive elements, and so on. It follows inductively
    that any equality-free statement φ(*a*[0],...,*a[n]*) true of individuals in *M*
    will also be true in *M** of any of their duplicates φ(*a*[0]*,...,*a[n]**). In
    particular, the structure *M** will not be able to discern an individual from
    its copies, and so this structure will not be Leibnizian if indeed any nontrivial
    duplication occurred. Furthermore, the two models have exactly the same equality-free
    truth assertions; they are elementarily equivalent in that language. (Meanwhile,
    with equality we can distinguish the models, since ⩽ is anti-symmetric in ℚ, meaning

    you say about a nonempty structure can possibly ensure that it is Leibnizian,

    equality-free assertions as the corresponding structure in which every individual
    has been duplicated.

- en: While definability and even discernibility are sufficient for capturing the
    structural roles played by an object, they are not necessary, and a fuller account
    will arise from the notion of an isomorphism orbit. Specifically, two mathematical
    structures *A* and *B* are *isomorphic* if they are copies of one another, or
    more precisely, if there is an *isomorphism* π:*A* → *B* between them, a one-to-one
    correspondence or bijective map between the respective domains of the structures
    that respects the salient structural relations and operations. For example, an
    order isomorphism of linear orders ⟨*L*[1], ⩽[1]⟩ and ⟨*L*[2], ⩽[2]⟩ is a bijection
    π:*L*[1] → *L*[2] between the domains of the orders that preserves the order structure
    from one to the other, meaning that *x* ⩽[1]  *y* if and only if π(*x*) ⩽[2] π(*y*).
    An isomorphism of arithmetic structures ⟨*Y*,+,·⟩ and ⟨*Z*,⊕,⊗⟩ is a bijection
    τ:*Y* → *Z*, for which τ(*a* + *b*) = τ(*a*) ⊕ τ(*b*) and τ(*a* · *b*) = τ(*a*)
    ⊙ τ(*b*), translating the structure from *Y* to *Z*. Every mathematical structural
    conception is accompanied by a corresponding isomorphism concept.

    ⩽[1]⟩和⟨*L*[2], ⩽[2]⟩的顺序同构是一个从一个排序的域到另一个的双射π：*L*[1] → *L*[2]，它从一个到另一个保持了顺序结构，意味着仅当*x*
    ⩽[1]  *y*时才有π(*x*) ⩽[2] π(*y*)。算术结构⟨*Y*,+,·⟩和⟨*Z*,⊕,⊗⟩的同构是一个从*Y*到*Z*的双射τ：对于τ(*a*

    (see sections 1.11 and 1.13). Daniel Isaacson (2011) emphasizes the role that
    categoricity plays in identifying particular mathematical structures. Namely,
    we become familiar with a structure; we find the essential features of that structure;
    and then we prove that those features axiomatically characterize the structure
    up to isomorphism. For Isaacson, this is what it means to identify a particular

    we ever pick out a definite mathematical structure, except by identifying a categorical
    theory that is true in it? Because of categoricity, we need not set up a standard
    canonical copy of the natural numbers, like the iron rod kept in Paris that defined

    axiom for arbitrary sets of natural numbers, and we shall see in section 1.11

    also true in models of diverse infinite cardinalities, which therefore cannot

    is that Dedekind arithmetic relies fundamentally on the concept of arbitrary collections
    of numbers, a concept that is itself less secure and definite than the natural-number
    concept with which we are concerned. If we had doubts about the definiteness of
    the natural numbers, how can we assuaged by an argument relying on the comparatively
    indefinite concept of “arbitrary collection”? Which collections are there? The

    features of the Rado graph, provided that the theorem itself was invariant under
    graph isomorphisms, for then it would transfer from the Rado graph to all copies

  zh: 请注意，从逻辑上讲，通过证明关于可数随机图的某些特性来证明关于Rado图的某些特性是可以的，即使使用Rado图的特定特征也是可以的，只要定理本身在图同构下是不变的，因为这样它就可以从Rado图推广到所有可数随机图的副本。在这个意义上，结构主义在实践中似乎只需要一个定理是结构主义的，也就是说，它们在同构下是适当不变的。
- en: Yet, the structuralist imperative recommends against that style of proof, against
    using nonstructural details of one's specific interpretation instances, even when
    they might seem convenient. The reason is that those details never lie at the
    core of the mathematical phenomenon—they are always a distraction—precisely because
    they cannot matter for the structuralist conclusion of the theorem. If you have
    a proof of an isomorphism-invariant theorem that uses incidental details of a
    specific instantiation, then the mathematical structuralist will say that you
    have a poor argument; you have missed the essential point; and your argument will
    not produce mathematical insight. In this sense, the structuralist imperative
    is a recommendation about mathematical efficacy. Namely, by undertaking structural
    arguments, we will stay closer on the trail of mathematical truth.

  zh: 然而，结构主义的要求建议不采用这种证明方式，不要使用自己特定解释实例的非结构性细节，即使它们看起来很方便。原因是这些细节从来不是数学现象的核心——它们总是在分散注意力——因为它们对于定理的结构主义结论并不重要。如果你用一个具体实例的偶发细节来证明一个同构不变的定理，那么数学结构主义者会说你的论证很差；你错过了关键点；你的论证将不会产生数学洞见。在这个意义上，结构主义的要求是关于数学效能的建议。换句话说，通过进行结构论证，我们将更接近数学真理的轨迹。
- en: Meanwhile, it would be structuralist to prove theorems about the Rado graph
    if one was concerned with some of the extra structure inherent in that particular
    presentation of this graph. For example, the edge relation of the Rado graph is
    a computably decidable relation on the natural numbers, but not every copy of
    the countable random graph on the natural numbers is computably decidable. In
    this case, one is not really studying the countable random graph, with only its
    graph structure, but rather one is studying computable model theory, looking at
    the computational complexity of presentations of this graph. This is again structural,
    but with different additional structure beyond pure graph theory.

    approach to programming treats its data objects only with respect to the structural
    features explicitly in the defining data types; this way of programming is often
    portable to other operating systems and implementations of the programming language.
    It would be antistructuralist for a program to use details of how a particular
    piece of data is represented on a particular system, to peek into the internal
    coding of data in the machine; this sneaky way of getting at the data might work
    fine at first, but it often causes portability issues because the methods can

    dismisses the Julius Caesar objection as misguided, for it does not matter what
    the cardinal numbers are, so long as they obey the Cantor-Hume principle, and
    so we do not care if any of them are Julius Caesar or not. Indeed, we can easily
    define an interpretation of number in which Julius Caesar is the number 17, or

- en: 'What I am calling *structuralism in practice* is closely related to *eliminative
    structuralism* (also called *post-rem structuralism*), defended by Benacerraf
    (1965)—namely, the view that mathematical structure is simply that which is instantiated
    in particular structures. Eliminative structuralism includes the nominalist claim
    that there is no abstract object that is the mathematical structure itself, beyond
    representations in particular instantiations. There is no abstract thing that
    is “the number 3”—any object can play that role in a suitable structure—and so
    talk of numbers and other particular mathematical objects is merely instrumental.
    Shapiro (1996) says, “Accordingly, numerals are not genuine singular terms, but
    are disguised bound variables.” A reference to the number 3 really means: in the
    model of Dedekind arithmetic at hand, the successor of the successor of the successor
    of zero.'

    however, is that the structuralist-in-practice drops the elimination claim, the
    nominalist ontological claim that abstract structural objects do not exist; rather,
    the structuralist-in-practice simply follows the structuralist imperative to pursue
    isomorphism-invariant mathematics, whether abstract structural objects exist or
    not. And since elimination is not part of the view, it would seem wrong to call
    it eliminative structuralism.

    also called *in-re structuralism* and defended by Geoffrey Hellman, according
    to which assertions about mathematical objects are to be understood modally as
    necessary claims about their possible instantiations. According to this view,
    mathematical structures are ontologically dependent on the systems that exemplify
    them. In extreme form, one might hope to reduce mathematical structure ultimately
    to concrete physical systems. And there is also a relative form of eliminative
    structuralism, which reduces structure to sets. Namely, according to *set-theoretic
    reductionism*, an extreme form of set-theoretic foundationalism, structure does
    not exist apart from its set-theoretic realizations, such as by means of the isomorphism
    orbit. This is different from merely using set theory as a foundation of mathematics,
    since one can propose set theory as a foundation simply by interpreting mathematical
    structure within set theory, without insisting that there is no structure outside
    of set theory.

    who follows the structuralist imperative, yet happily refers to *the* natural
    numbers and *the* number 17 and *the* real number π. If we only care about the
    natural numbers up to isomorphism, after all, then there is not any longer a unique
    mathematical object or structure corresponding to these terms, and so what is
    meant by “the” here? It would seem that the structuralist-in-practice should be
    referring instead to *a* natural numbers or *a* number 17\. But mathematicians
    do not generally talk that way, even when they are structuralist. Structuralism

    reference. According to *abstract structuralism*, also known as *ante-rem structuralism*,
    defended by Stewart Shapiro (1997), Michael Resnik (1988), and others, the objects
    of mathematics, including numbers, functions, and sets, are inherently structural;
    they exist as purely structural abstract objects, positions within a structure,
    locations in a pattern of arrangement that might be realized in diverse instantiations.
    The quarterback is a position on an American football team, the role played by
    the person who calls the play, receives the hike and makes the passes. Each individual
    quarterback is a person rather than a position — a person who plays the role of
    quarterback on a particular team. Similarly, the natural number 3 is the third
    successor “location” in the natural number structure — the position that any particular
    copy of 3 fills in any particular instantiation of the natural numbers. On this
    view, mathematical structure exists independently of the particular systems instantiating
    that structure.

    the Fregean process of abstraction from the same-structural-role relation, whose
    equivalence classes are precisely the isomorphism orbits. Every isomorphism orbit
    leads one by abstraction to a corresponding abstract structural role. Shapiro
    also argues, much like Maddy in the egg carton argument (mentioned on page 21),

    the mathematical objects are, even if the answer it provides is that they are
    purely structural. According to the structuralist-in-practice, such concerns are
    misguided; they never elucidate a mathematical phenomenon and are irrelevant for
    mathematical insight. The structuralist-in-practice will happily consider any
    classification invariant of the isomorphism orbit relation, such as the orbit
    itself (akin to Frege taking numbers as equinumerosity classes), without the need
