    survived three lunar nights.

  zh: 日本的月球智能着陆器（SLIM）再次苏醒，已经度过了三个月球夜晚。
- en: A [post](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1783330118683050427) on social
    media from the lander's X account confirmed that once more, SLIM had defied the
    odds and snapped a picture of the lunar surface using its navigation camera.

  zh: 在社交媒体上，来自着陆器X账户的[帖子](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1783330118683050427)确认，SLIM再次蔑视了一切可能性，并使用其导航摄像头拍摄了月球表面的照片。
- en: SLIM was revived [a few weeks ago](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/jaxa_slim_awakens/),
    after a second lunar night. However, with telemetry showing that some of the electronics
    (temperature sensors) and battery cells were [malfunctioning](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1773162603075821881),
    the chances of the lander making it through a third lunar night seemed remote.

  zh: SLIM在经历了第二个月球夜后[a few weeks ago](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/jaxa_slim_awakens/)苏醒。然而，遥测显示部分电子设备（温度传感器）和电池单元出现了[malfunctioning](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1773162603075821881)，登陆器能否度过第三个月球夜的机会似乎渺茫。

    lacking heaters to keep its electronics warm.

  zh: 尽管缺乏保持电子设备温暖的加热器，但SLIM再次在月球表面活跃起来。
- en: Spacecraft designed to survive extreme cold are usually constructed with heaters
    to keep electronics toasty. The surface temperature on the Moon can drop below
    −150°C, and the temperature in some craters can get as low as −247°C.

  zh: 通常设计用于在极端寒冷条件下生存的航天器都会安装加热器以保持电子设备的温暖。月球表面的温度可以低至−150°C，而在某些陨石坑中的温度甚至可以低至−247°C。

- en: SLIM was only designed to last until the end of its first lunar day on the Moon's
    surface. The mission was initially declared a "minimum success" because the lander
    tipped onto its side during the landing, meaning that it could not achieve all
    the intended goals.

  zh: SLIM原本只设计在月球表面的首个月球日结束前运行。由于着陆时登陆器倾斜，无法实现所有预期目标，所以任务最初被宣布为“最低成功”。
- en: Despite this, SLIM has exceeded all endurance expectations and come around after
    a third lunar night.

  zh: 尽管如此，SLIM超出了所有耐久性的预期，在第三个月球夜后再次活跃。
- en: JAXA gave no indication as to whether SLIM might survive a fourth lunar night
    or the state of the lander's electronics. At the start of April, hopes that a
    third night might be survivable were tempered with a warning that "the sensors
    and other functions are gradually being lost."

  zh: JAXA并未说明SLIM是否能够度过第四个月球夜，或者登陆器电子设备的状态。四月初开始，关于第三个夜晚能否存活的希望，受到了“传感器和其他功能逐渐丧失”的警告的限制。
