    survived three lunar nights.

- en: A [post](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1783330118683050427) on social
    media from the lander's X account confirmed that once more, SLIM had defied the
    odds and snapped a picture of the lunar surface using its navigation camera.

- en: SLIM was revived [a few weeks ago](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/02/jaxa_slim_awakens/),
    after a second lunar night. However, with telemetry showing that some of the electronics
    (temperature sensors) and battery cells were [malfunctioning](https://twitter.com/SLIM_JAXA/status/1773162603075821881),
    the chances of the lander making it through a third lunar night seemed remote.

    lacking heaters to keep its electronics warm.

- en: Spacecraft designed to survive extreme cold are usually constructed with heaters
    to keep electronics toasty. The surface temperature on the Moon can drop below
    −150°C, and the temperature in some craters can get as low as −247°C.

    social media presence: "SLIM has maintained main functionality even after three
    nights on the Moon, which was not anticipated in the design!'

- en: SLIM was only designed to last until the end of its first lunar day on the Moon's
    surface. The mission was initially declared a "minimum success" because the lander
    tipped onto its side during the landing, meaning that it could not achieve all
    the intended goals.

    a third lunar night.

- en: JAXA gave no indication as to whether SLIM might survive a fourth lunar night
    or the state of the lander's electronics. At the start of April, hopes that a
    third night might be survivable were tempered with a warning that "the sensors
    and other functions are gradually being lost."
