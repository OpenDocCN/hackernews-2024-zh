    video editing and when I'm on my MacBook Pro (because I haven't found a superior
    [Linux laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-laptop/)). Every time
    I'm on MacOS, I find myself wishing it had certain capabilities and features found
    on Linux. After all, MacOS already has some foundation features (such as similar
    command line tools) borrowed from Linux.

    some of these features, it would become a bigger force than it already is.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For me, this is a big one. I also understand just how hard it would be to implement.
    For one thing, Apple wants its users to work with MacOS in a very particular way.
    But the MacOS desktop isn't quite as efficient as some you find on Linux. For
    years, I've wished I could install different desktop environments on MacOS, similar
    to GNOME, KDE Plasma, Enlightenment, etc.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But, no, Apple has pretty much locked down the desktop and only offers a few
    configuration options for users. Imagine what MacOS would be like if you could
    highly customize the desktop to look and behave exactly how you want it. Linux
    can do that.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linux has multiple ways you can manage software. There are the GUI package managers
    (such as Software and Discover) but there's also the command line (with the likes
    of apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, etc.). MacOS has Homebrew but you have to install
    it manually and it can be a bit confusing when you have to add cask into the mix.
    If MacOS had something similar to apt, it would make installing, removing, updating,
    and purging applications so much easier (at least for those who prefer the command
    line).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to number 1, it would be nice if MacOS could be a bit more flexible.
    The flexibility of Linux is one of its main selling points (along with security
    and reliability). With Linux, you can change just about anything you want (all
    the way down to the kernel). MacOS doesn't enjoy nearly that level of flexibility.
    Imagine what MacOS would be like if you could change anything you wanted.

- en: Yes, that type of flexibility could also make it less stable, so Apple would
    want to add those options behind something like the Android "developer options"
    feature, so users knew what they were getting into. One of the biggest reasons
    why I use Linux is because I can turn any distribution into exactly what I want.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I remember the days of using Compiz and getting the Desktop Cube to work. It
    was always one of my favorite methods of switching desktops and apps. On top of
    that, it looked so cool. Some desktop environments (such as [KDE Plasma](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kde-neon-shows-that-the-plasma-6-linux-distro-is-something-truly-special/))
    have brought back Desktop Cube and I couldn't be happier. Yes, it's just eye candy
    but I cut my teeth on Linux in the late '90s and early 2000s when the Linux desktop
    had so much eye candy that you risked suffering from digital diabetes. Also, wobbly
    windows were a lot of fun.

    text. Even better, you could do the standard highlight one bit of text, hit Ctrl-c,
    highlight another bit of text, and then hit Ctrl-V to paste the first string and
    middle mouse click to paste the second.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linux enjoys several universal package managers but [Snap and Flatpak](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-snap-and-flatpak-make-linux-a-better-os-for-the-average-user/)
    are the leaders of that pack. With these package managers, everything necessary
    to run the application is contained within, so it doesn't matter what distribution
    you use, it'll work. If MacOS could adopt a universal package manager, that would
    not only make app installation even easier but also (maybe) allow the installation
    of Linux snaps or flatpak packages possible, it would be an absolute game changer.
    That could also go both ways, with MacOS universal packages capable of being installed
    on Linux. Imagine what that would be like.
