- en: The Windows behemoth is known for running ads in its flagship operating system.
    In 2022, the company released a build that [displayed ads in File Explorer](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/15/file_explorer_ad/),
    which it subsequently backed away from. Windows 10 has long featured ads, so the
    prospect of Microsoft utilizing space in the Windows 11 user interface for its
    "recommendations" is not unexpected.
