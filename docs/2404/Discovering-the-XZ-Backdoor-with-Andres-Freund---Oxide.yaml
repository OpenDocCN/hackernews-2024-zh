    It’s an incredible story… so great to get into the details with Andres. We started
    by ranting about the coverage in the New York Times… coverage that explicitly
    refused to dig into the details! It’s all the more shocking because the big story
    here is how Andres’ penchant for digging into the details is what saved us all
    from what would have been a pervasive and damaging attack!
