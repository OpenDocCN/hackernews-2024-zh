    and had studied the subject in college, but society expected her to become a housewife,
    which she did. So while Lore studied hard, she also watched for an opportunity
    to do something different. In February 1964, one of her friends pulled out of

    Lore had been waiting for. She went instead.

    had stayed in America to escape a future where her only option was to be a housewife.Yet
    in Westlake Village, this was the only role it seemed possible for her to play.
    While Bob worked, she was required to manage the home and join the various women’s
    groups and their activities like charity fundraisers and dinner parties—obligations
    expected by her community and Bob’s employer. To try and prevent this from taking
    over her whole life, she started studying anthropology. But then she became pregnant
    with their first child and was forced to abandon her studies. A second—another
    daughter—followed two years later. When the children were three and five, Harp
    tried to pursue school again, this time hoping to follow in her aunt’s footsteps
    and become a lawyer. But law school was not friendly to young mothers.

    I studied, even though he was otherwise supportive,” she said. Forced to quit,
    Harp felt frustrated and isolated. The social activities that seemed to provide

    had never imagined that he might one day own a machine of his own. He placed an
    order for the Altair, which was billed as the world’s first mass-market “microcomputer.”
    When the machine arrived in kit form, Bob quickly assembled it and it became one
    of his obsessions. The Harp house was soon filled with pamphlets, newsletters,
    and how-to guides about microcomputers, and Bob discovered, to his delight, that
    the Altair’s creator Ed Roberts had built it around a principle of “open architecture”
    via its S-100 expansion socket. Anyone could create memory boards or peripherals
    that could expand the functionality of the machine . A few third-party expansions
    were already on the market and more were being released regularly, but Bob decided
    it would be more interesting (and a fun test of his skills) to design his own
    expansion board. Over the course of a few months, he created a board for his own
    use, one that would double the amount of RAM in his Altair from 4K to a mighty
    8K.

    a microcomputer that was reliable, powerful, expandable, and pre-built—unlike
    hobbyists, most businesses had no desire to assemble their own machines from a
    kit. It also wouldn’t hurt if it was something that could serve as an office centerpiece
    around important clients. A machine that ticked all these boxes didn’t yet exist.
    The market was machines like the Altair or Apple at the low end or expensive,
    room-sized computers by IBM or others at the high end. There was nothing in between,

- en: Harp McGovern’s departure sealed the fate of Vector Graphic, although the company
    would limp on for a few more years. In October 1987 Vector Graphic finally declared
    bankruptcy. By that point, Harp McGovern herself had been out of the picture for
    three years. That didn’t stop a number of journalists from treating its failure
    as unspoken vindication that housewives—and Ice Maidens—lacked the mettle to succeed.
    The departure of Bob was often pushed as the turning point. Bob himself was often
    on hand to provide a useful quote in support of this idea.

    decisions had been made, it would be quite successful.”

    after her departure. To her, Vector wasn’t just a company. It was more than that.
    It was something she and Ely had built from nothing into a profitable community
    of people.

    By 1987, she was back. With Vector gone, she founded (and funded) one of the first
    companies attempting to develop disposable urinal funnels that would allow women
    to urinate standing up. Then, in partnership with her husband Pat, she launched
    a venture capital fund. In 1994, she became one of the original [“Band of Angels”](https://www.bandangels.com/)—one
    of the first angel investor groups in California focused on technology and life
    sciences.

    what drove her. “Growing people within the company, accepting the challenge of
    being out there, competing against other companies and making an impact.”

    for growth, but over time she became disillusioned with this world. Many investors
    were happy to take her money, but they refused to accept that she might have useful
    advice to offer.

    size with an international distribution network, having gone through raising venture
    capital, having gone through taking the company public and that sort of thing—I
    felt I could make a great contribution to other young companies that wanted to
    start in business,” she said later. The reality was quite different. Most entrepreneurs
    don’t want all the help I thought I could bring.”

    at MIT. She played an active role in establishing it as one of the foremost research
    institutes into the brain in the world.

    we are yet to explore, Lore Harp McGovern is likely the one who has been overlooked
    the most. Perhaps only Harp McGovern’s friend Sandy Kurtzig runs close. While
    Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were building a computer empire in the suburbs of
    California, Lore Harp McGovern and Carole Ely were doing the same. As with Adam
    Osborne, however, the history of Silicon Valley likes to focus on its winners.

    up and beat men at their own game are often those that are the quietest when that
    actually happens. Harp McGovern didn’t just shatter Silicon Valley’s glass ceiling—the
    Ice Maiden (or “the awful bitch”) used its broken shards to carve out a place
    for herself, her company, and her employees along the way. All too often, her
    successes have been allocated to other people, while her failures have been attributed
    to her alone. For all these reasons, one of Silicon Valley’s true pioneers has
    been granted only a single [inaccurate paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lore_Harp_McGovern)

    with the Computer History Museum. “I'm delighted to do this, mainly because there
    were so few women in the industry at the time,” she said, when thanked for her
    contribution to the museum’s archive. “And also for my grandchildren to see that
    their grandmother actually did things that not a lot of women did in those days.”

    well to ask one of Silicon Valley’s last remaining original founders for her advice.
    If she’s prepared to offer it, then listen.
