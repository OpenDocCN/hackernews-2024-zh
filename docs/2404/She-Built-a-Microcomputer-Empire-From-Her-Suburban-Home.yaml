    reality didn’t always match the ideal. Her mother was a talented photographer
    and had studied the subject in college, but society expected her to become a housewife,
    which she did. So while Lore studied hard, she also watched for an opportunity
    to do something different. In February 1964, one of her friends pulled out of
    a planned six-month exchange visit with an American family. It was the opportunity
    Lore had been waiting for. She went instead.

    Research Laboratories, which he accepted. For Harp, this meant leaving vibrant
    Los Angeles for a more traditional suburban life in Westlake Village, California.

    While Bob worked, she was required to manage the home and join the various women’s
    groups and their activities like charity fundraisers and dinner parties—obligations
    expected by her community and Bob’s employer. To try and prevent this from taking
    over her whole life, she started studying anthropology. But then she became pregnant
    with their first child and was forced to abandon her studies. A second—another
    daughter—followed two years later. When the children were three and five, Harp
    tried to pursue school again, this time hoping to follow in her aunt’s footsteps
    and become a lawyer. But law school was not friendly to young mothers.

    8800](https://every.to/the-crazy-ones/the-secret-father-of-modern-computing) on
    its cover. Bob Harp, like many who worked with large computers in their workplace,
    had never imagined that he might one day own a machine of his own. He placed an
    order for the Altair, which was billed as the world’s first mass-market “microcomputer.”
    When the machine arrived in kit form, Bob quickly assembled it and it became one
    of his obsessions. The Harp house was soon filled with pamphlets, newsletters,
    and how-to guides about microcomputers, and Bob discovered, to his delight, that
    the Altair’s creator Ed Roberts had built it around a principle of “open architecture”
    via its S-100 expansion socket. Anyone could create memory boards or peripherals
    that could expand the functionality of the machine . A few third-party expansions
    were already on the market and more were being released regularly, but Bob decided
    it would be more interesting (and a fun test of his skills) to design his own
    expansion board. Over the course of a few months, he created a board for his own
    use, one that would double the amount of RAM in his Altair from 4K to a mighty
    8K.

    had offered Veit. By October 1976, orders were flooding in. Harp and Ely’s product
    wasn’t revolutionary, nor were their boards significantly cheaper than their rivals,
    but their approach to the process of sales and ordering was more professional.
    This also extended to the board kits themselves. The pair hadn’t forgotten the
    poor-quality instructions and packaging they’d seen at computer fairs when starting

    a microcomputer that was reliable, powerful, expandable, and pre-built—unlike
    hobbyists, most businesses had no desire to assemble their own machines from a
    kit. It also wouldn’t hurt if it was something that could serve as an office centerpiece
    around important clients. A machine that ticked all these boxes didn’t yet exist.
    The market was machines like the Altair or Apple at the low end or expensive,

    home computer world abuzz with the announcement of the Apple II, a pre-built machine
    for home users. Just a few booths down, Lore Harp and Carole Ely did the same
    thing for businesses with the announcement of the Vector 1, designed by Bob Harp.
    In terms of CPU and RAM, it wasn’t anything special, launching with the same specifications
    as the Altair 8800\. What differentiated it was that it could be easily expanded—well
    beyond the limits of the Altair. It also came pre-built.

    to the top of the second tier of microcomputer manufacturers that almost exclusively

    larger unit sales if figures for both the business and home markets were combined,
    but when it came to more expensive machines for medium-sized businesses, Vector
    was the dominant player. By 1980, it was achieving $25 million (about $95 million
    today) in annual sales. The company that had been started in Harp’s converted
    back bedroom was now a well-known brand within the computing industry.

    a range of machines based on dated technology longer than other manufacturers.
    As a result, its customer base was slow to upgrade to new machines, choosing to
    wait until Vector released one based on 16-bit technology. This problem was compounded
    by the release of the Vector 3, its final 8-bit machine. The computer itself was

    building future machines around this upstart operating system began to look more
    attractive. It could offer more functionality, while IBM’s adoption of DOS all
    but guaranteed that software companies would rewrite their business software to

    there was no guarantee that every piece of software they needed would be ported

    that IBM would soon lose interest in the microcomputer market, leaving it entirely.
    If that happened, it would leave Vector alone on DOS—a precarious position to
    be in. In the end, the board agreed that moving to DOS was the bigger risk. This
    decision robbed Vector of the chance to be one of the first manufacturers to offer

    companies attempting to develop disposable urinal funnels that would allow women
    to urinate standing up. Then, in partnership with her husband Pat, she launched
    a venture capital fund. In 1994, she became one of the original [“Band of Angels”](https://www.bandangels.com/)—one
    of the first angel investor groups in California focused on technology and life
    sciences.

    what drove her. “Growing people within the company, accepting the challenge of
    being out there, competing against other companies and making an impact.”

    for growth, but over time she became disillusioned with this world. Many investors
    were happy to take her money, but they refused to accept that she might have useful
    advice to offer.

    size with an international distribution network, having gone through raising venture
    capital, having gone through taking the company public and that sort of thing—I
    felt I could make a great contribution to other young companies that wanted to
    start in business,” she said later. The reality was quite different. Most entrepreneurs
    don’t want all the help I thought I could bring.”

    2000, alongside her husband Pat, she gave $350 million to endow the McGovern Institute
    at MIT. She played an active role in establishing it as one of the foremost research
    institutes into the brain in the world.

    we are yet to explore, Lore Harp McGovern is likely the one who has been overlooked
    the most. Perhaps only Harp McGovern’s friend Sandy Kurtzig runs close. While
    Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were building a computer empire in the suburbs of
    California, Lore Harp McGovern and Carole Ely were doing the same. As with Adam
    Osborne, however, the history of Silicon Valley likes to focus on its winners.

    up and beat men at their own game are often those that are the quietest when that
    actually happens. Harp McGovern didn’t just shatter Silicon Valley’s glass ceiling—the
    Ice Maiden (or “the awful bitch”) used its broken shards to carve out a place
    for herself, her company, and her employees along the way. All too often, her
    successes have been allocated to other people, while her failures have been attributed
    to her alone. For all these reasons, one of Silicon Valley’s true pioneers has
    been granted only a single [inaccurate paragraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lore_Harp_McGovern)

    with the Computer History Museum. “I'm delighted to do this, mainly because there
    were so few women in the industry at the time,” she said, when thanked for her
    contribution to the museum’s archive. “And also for my grandchildren to see that
    their grandmother actually did things that not a lot of women did in those days.”

    well to ask one of Silicon Valley’s last remaining original founders for her advice.
    If she’s prepared to offer it, then listen.
