    to trust their hardware through my IRIS (Infra-Red, in-situ) technique for the
    [non-destructive inspection of chips](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2024/iris-infra-red-in-situ-project-updates/).

    for IRIS, I covered the electronic design, and noted that an important conclusion
    of the electronic design exploration was the need for a continuously variable,
    2-axis mechanical positioning solution for the light sources. This post dives
    into the details of the mechanical positioning solution, shown above.

    a continuously adjustable mechanical solution for positioning the lights.

    a connecting rod to the light source. The light source itself would be mounted

    motor driving a carriage on a track is like building a small toy train that could
    drive around in circles. However, it required putting the motor mass in the moving
    assembly, and using a single motor to drive the carriage introduced concerns about
    asymmetries due to a lack of balance around the central axis. The second idea
    is quite similar to the first, but even harder to execute. For these reasons,
    I decided to pursue neither of the first two ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last idea, a pulley driving an assembly mounted on a coaxial bearing, had
    the advantage that I could re-use the Jubilee’s [cable-driven pulley design for
    the tool changer](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=The_Remote_Elastic_Lock)
    (referred to as the “remote elastic lock”); so from that stand point, the motor,
    drive software, and coupling were already done and tested. It also moved the motor
    mass out of the moving carriage assembly, and lent itself to a symmetrically balanced
    arrangement of parts.

    moving assembly. The bearing is unusual in that the load is parallel to the axis,
    instead of perpendicular to it. Most bearings with a hole large enough to accommodate
    the microscope tube are designed for really big, powerful machines (think of a
    motor that has a 2.5cm (1 inch) drive shaft!), and are likewise big and heavy,
    and also not rated for loads parallel to the axis.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I figured the first step was to make the load as light as possible, without
    sacrificing precision. I decided for symmetry there would be two lights, so they
    would serve as counter-balances to each other. This also meant I could reduce
    the range of motion to a bit over 180 degrees, instead of 360 degrees, to get
    full coverage of the chip. However, this also doubled the weight of the mechanism.

    23-06 2200KV position modules](https://www.vertiq.co/23-06) ([distributor](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vertiq/VERT-M1.0-E3.0-F1.0-SC1.0-PCK1.0?qs=QNEnbhJQKvbBXLpMQzQQRg%3D%3D)

    I had [previously written](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5215) about these,
    but in a nutshell they are BLDC motors, similar to the ones used in light-weight
    quadcopter drones, but with a built-in microcontroller, drive electronics and
    sensors that allowed them to act like stepper motors through some firmware changes.
    They are the smallest, lightest, and best power-to-weight ratio “serial to position”
    modules I am aware of, making them perfect for the zenith drive mechanism.

    with building the bearing using three “[cam follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_follower)”
    wheels – basically a ball bearing on a shaft – normally used for [cam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(mechanism))
    mechanisms. In this case, the “cam” is simply a flat, circular track made out
    of [POM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxymethylene) (for low friction and
    wear properties), and the “followers” are miniature cam followers [available from
    Misumi](https://sg.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110310432179/). They are arranged
    around the central bearing using a hexagonal clamp composed of three identical
    parts that are screwed together to fully constrain the follower’s motion to stay
    on the circular path.

    motor mounted on the Jubilee chassis – as mentioned above, the drive is just a
    copy of the existing mechanism included on the Jubilee for actuating the tool
    changer, down to using the exact same cables, cable guides, and stepper motor.
    The main difference is that the pulley is enlarged to match the size of the pulley
    on the rotating assembly, allowing the gearing ratio between the stepper motor
    and the rotating assembly to remain the same.

    are still some rough edges. The control software still has some minor bugs, especially
    when recovering from crashes when the actuators are already at an end-stop limit
    – I have to manually move the actuators off the end stop before the control software
    can function again. The focal point of the lights is also shifted by a couple
    of millimeters, due to a last-minute change in preferred microscope objectives.
    Fixing that should be pretty easy; I will need to remake the semi-circular tracks
    on which the lights travel, as well as the connecting rods to the lead screws
    to compensate for the change.

    light source. This turns out to be necessary for imaging chips with highly doped
    substrates. The transparency of silicon goes down quickly with dopant concentration.
    Foundries like TSMC seem to use a very lightly doped “P-” type of base wafer,
    so their chips image well at 1050nm. However, shops like Intel seem to use a heavily
    doped “P+” type of base wafer, and the wafers are much more opaque at that wavelength.
    I’m not 100% sure of the mechanism, but I think the extra dopant atoms scatter
    light readily, especially at shorter wavelengths. LED light sources have a fairly
    broad spectrum, so even if the center wavelength is at 1050nm, there’s a substantial
    amount of light still being emitted at 1000nm and shorter. These shorter wavelengths
    interact heavily with the dopant atoms, scattering in the bulk of the silicon.

    like trying to see through thick fog with your high beams on: you see mostly a
    bright gray, with glints of the underlying wires coming through every now and
    then. A 1064 nm laser has a tighter bandwidth – just a couple of nm wide – and
    so the interaction with silicon substrate is more proportional to the light that’s
    reflected off of the wires underneath. It’s still a challenge to image chips with
    unthinned substrates, but early experiments seem promising, and I would like to
    be able to easily image Intel CPUs as part of the capabilities of IRIS.'

    lasers run a minimum of $100) and export controls (IR lasers are flagged by the
    US as requiring elevated scrutiny for export, and are thus harder to buy; incorporating
    it into the design transitively limits the market for IRIS). Lasers also interact
    strongly with sub-wavelength features on the chip, which is a plus and a minus;
    on the upside, there is more opportunity to gather information about the structure
    of the chip; on the downside, you have to be extremely precise in your laser’s
    positioning to make reproducible measurements. Also, credit where credit is due:
    I didn’t come up with the idea of using a laser for this, [Cactus Duper](https://twitter.com/cactusduper)
