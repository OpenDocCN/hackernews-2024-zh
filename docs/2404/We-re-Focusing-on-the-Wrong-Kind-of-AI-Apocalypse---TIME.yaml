    prominent computer scientists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/25/ai-bengio-anthropic-senate-hearing/)
    have raised, the risks of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—an AI smarter
    than a human being. They worry that an AGI will lead to mass unemployment or that
    AI will grow beyond human control—or worse (the movies *Terminator* and *2001*
    come to mind).

  zh: 有相当多的关注集中在人工智能的未来上，特别是如[一些著名的计算机科学家](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/25/ai-bengio-anthropic-senate-hearing/)所提出的，关于超过人类智能的人工智能（AGI）的风险。他们担心AGI将导致大规模失业，或者人工智能将超出人类的控制能力——或者更糟糕（电影*终结者*和*2001年太空漫游*中的情况浮现）。
- en: Discussing these concerns seems important, as does thinking about the much more
    mundane and immediate threats of misinformation, deep fakes, and proliferation
    enabled by AI. But this focus on apocalyptic events also robs most of us of our
    agency. AI becomes a thing we either build or don’t build, and no one outside
    of a few dozen Silicon Valley executives and top government officials really has
    any say over.

  zh: 讨论这些问题似乎很重要，像是思考关于由人工智能带来的虚假信息、深度伪造和扩散的更为平凡和即时的威胁。但是，将注意力集中在这些世界末日事件上也会剥夺我们大多数人的主动性。人工智能变成我们要么构建要么不构建的东西，而在几十位硅谷高管和高级政府官员之外，实际上没有其他人有发言权。
- en: But the reality is we are already living in the early days of the AI Age, and,
    at every level of an organization, we need to make some very important decisions
    about what that actually means. Waiting to make these choices means they will

- en: 'We know this is a real threat, because, regardless of any pauses in AI creation,
    and without any further AI development beyond what is available today, AI is going
    to impact how we work and learn. We know this for three reasons: First, AI really
    does seem to supercharge productivity in ways we have never really seen before.
    An [early controlled study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321)
    in September 2023 showed large-scale improvements at work tasks, as a result of
    using AI, with time savings of more than 30% and a higher quality output for those
    using AI. Add to that the [near-immaculate test scores](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1635700173946105856)
    achieved by GPT-4, and it is obvious why AI use is already becoming common among

  zh: 我们知道这是一个真实的威胁，因为无论人工智能的创建是否暂停，以及除了今天已经可用的人工智能开发之外，人工智能都将影响我们的工作和学习。我们有三个理由可以这样认为：首先，人工智能似乎确实能够以我们从未见过的方式显著提升生产力。在[2023年9月的一项早期控制研究](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321)中显示，通过使用人工智能，工作任务的大规模改进，节省时间超过30%，而且使用人工智能的人员产出的质量更高。再加上GPT-4取得的[接近完美的测试分数](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1635700173946105856)，很明显为什么人工智能的使用已经在[学生](https://www.chronicle.com/article/im-a-student-you-have-no-idea-how-much-were-using-chatgpt)和工作者中变得普遍，即使他们保持秘密。

    affecting a set of workers who never really faced an automation shock before.
    Multiple studies show the [jobs most exposed to AI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4414065)
    (and therefore the people whose jobs will make the hardest pivot as a result of
    AI) are educated and highly paid workers, and the ones with the most creativity
    in their jobs. The pressure for organizations to take a stand on a technology
    that affects these workers will be immense, especially as AI-driven productivity

  zh: 我们也知道，AI将改变我们的工作和学习方式，因为它正在影响从未真正面对过自动化冲击的一组工人。多项研究显示，受AI影响最大的工作（因此，其工作将因AI而进行最艰难的转变）是受过教育且薪资高的工人，以及工作中具有最多创造力的人群。对组织在影响这些工人的技术上采取立场的压力将是巨大的，尤其是随着AI驱动的生产力提升逐渐普及。这些工具正在逐步[深度融入](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/it-is-starting-to-get-strange)我们的工作环境中。例如，微软已经为其广泛使用的Office应用发布了Co-Pilot
    GPT-4工具，而谷歌也为其办公工具做出了相同的努力。
- en: As a result, a natural instinct among many managers might be to say “fire people,
    save money.” But it doesn’t need to be that way—and it shouldn’t be. There are
    many reasons why companies should not turn efficiency gains into headcount or
    cost reduction. Companies that figure out how to use their newly productive workforce
    have the opportunity to dominate those who try to keep their post-AI output the
    same as their pre-AI output, just with less people. Companies that commit to maintaining
    their workforce will likely have employees as partners, who are happy to teach
    others about the uses of AI at work, rather than scared workers who hide AI for
    fear of being replaced. [Psychological safety](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1618249351905816576)

    one.

  zh: 因此，许多管理者的自然反应可能是“裁员，节省成本”。但事实并非如此，也不应如此。公司不应该将效率提升转化为裁员或成本削减的理由有很多。那些能够利用他们新获得的高效员工的公司，有机会超越那些试图保持其AI后产出与其AI前产出相同但人力更少的公司。致力于保持其员工的公司很可能会将员工视为合作伙伴，他们乐意教导他人如何在工作中使用AI，而不是因为害怕被取代而隐藏AI的恐惧工作者。[心理安全](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1618249351905816576)对创新团队的成功至关重要，尤其是在面对快速变化时。公司如何利用这种额外的效率是一个选择，也是一个非常重要的选择。
- en: There are hints buried in the [early studies of AI](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586)
    about a way forward. Workers, while worried about AI, tend to like using it because
    it removes the most tedious and annoying parts of their job, leaving them with
    the most interesting tasks. So, even as AI removes some previously valuable tasks
    from a job, the work that is left can be more meaningful and more high value.
    But this is not inevitable, so managers and leaders must decide whether and how
    to commit themselves to reorganizing work around AI in ways that help, rather
    than hurt, their human workers. They need to ask “what is my vision about how
    AI makes work better, rather than worse?”

  zh: 早期AI研究中隐藏着关于前进道路的线索，[人工智能的早期研究](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586)。尽管工人们对AI感到担忧，但他们喜欢使用它，因为它能够消除工作中最乏味和最烦人的部分，使他们留下最有趣的任务。因此，即使AI剥夺了工作中的一些先前有价值的任务，剩下的工作也可能更有意义和更高价值。但这并非必然，因此管理者和领导必须决定是否以及如何致力于围绕AI重新组织工作，以帮助而不是伤害他们的人力资源。他们需要问自己，“我的愿景是AI如何改善工作，而不是使其变得更糟？”
- en: Rather than just being worried about one giant AI apocalypse, we need to worry
    about the many small catastrophes that AI can bring. Unimaginative or stressed
    leaders may decide to use these new tools for surveillance and for layoffs. Educators
    may decide to use AI in ways that leave some students behind. And those are just

- en: But AI does not need to be catastrophic. Correctly used, AI can create local
    victories, where previously tedious or useless work becomes productive and empowering.

    is used are not limited to a small group of people. Many people in organizations
    will play a role in shaping what AI means for their team, their customers, their
    students, their environment. But to make those choices matter, serious discussions
