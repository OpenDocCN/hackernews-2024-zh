- en: The tech giants have overthrown capitalism. That’s the argument of former Greek
    finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who became famous trying to defend debt-laden
    Greece from its German creditors. Varoufakis has never quite regained the notoriety
    of 2015\. But he has remained a prominent left-wing voice. After a failed campaign
    for a seat in the European Parliament in 2019, he plans to run again this June.
    This time, his adversary isn’t Berlin or the banks. It’s the tech companies he
    accuses of warping the economy while turning people against one other.

- en: Varoufakis is also a prolific author; his 17th book, written as a letter to
    his techno-curious father, chronicles the evolution of capitalism from the 1960s
    advertising boom, through Wall Street in the 1980s, to the 2008 financial crisis
    and the pandemic. In its most compelling stretches, [*Technofeudalism*](https://www.amazon.com/Technofeudalism-Killed-Capitalism-Yanis-Varoufakis/dp/1685891241)
    argues that Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have changed the economy so much that
    it now resembles Europe’s medieval feudal system. The tech giants are the lords,
    while everyone else is a peasant, working their land for not much in return.

- en: To Varoufakis, every time you post on X, formerly Twitter, you’re essentially
    toiling Elon Musk’s estate like a medieval serf. Musk doesn't pay you. But your
    free labor pays him, in a sense, by increasing the value of his company. On X,
    the more active users there are, the more people can be shown advertising or sold
    subscriptions. On Google Maps, he argues, users improve the product—alerting the
    system to traffic jams on their route.

- en: The feudal comparison isn’t novel. But *Technofeudalism* attempts to introduce
    the idea to a wider audience. Its US release, launched the month before regulators
    in the [US](https://www.wired.com/story/doj-sues-apple-antitrust/) and [European
    Union](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-meta-alphabet-eu-digital-markets-act/)
    simultaneously initiated antitrust actions against Apple, also had impeccable
    timing.

    giants have changed the economy—and why we should care about it.

- en: '**Yanis Varoufakis:** Profit drives capitalism, rent drove feudalism. Now we
    have moved [from one system to the other] because of this new form of super-duper,
    all-singing, all-dancing capital: cloud capital, algorithmic capital. If I''m
    right, that is creating new digital fiefdoms like Amazon.com, like Airbnb, where
    the main mode of wealth extraction comes in the form not of profit but of rent.'

- en: Take the Apple Store. You are producing an app, Apple can withhold 30 percent
    of your profits [through a commission fee]. That's a rent. That's like a ground
    rent. It's a bit like the Apple Store is a fiefdom. It's a cloud fiefdom, and
    Apple extracts a rent exactly as in feudalism. So my argument is not that we went
    back from capitalism to feudalism. My argument is that we have progressed forward
    to a new system, which has many of the characteristics of feudalism, but it is
    one step ahead of capitalism. To signal that, I added the word *techno*.
