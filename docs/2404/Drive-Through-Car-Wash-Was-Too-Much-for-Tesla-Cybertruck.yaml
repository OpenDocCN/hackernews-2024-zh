    of ownership, [Tik Tok user @captian.ad’s Tesla Cybertruck](https://www.tiktok.com/@captian.ad)
    was effectively [a several-thousand-pound paperweight](https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cybertruck-teardown-finds-massive-battery-pack-lo-1851400405)
    for several hours. After taking his truck to the beach and stopping off at a car
    wash to clean it up, he parked the truck in his garage, [where it decided to just
    stop working for a while](https://www.tiktok.com/@captian.ad/video/7357905192454606123?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc).
    The screen, which runs all functions of the truck, went black, [and wouldn’t respond
    at all](https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cybertruck-owners-forum-is-already-full-of-tales-1851388334),
    even after performing the factory prescribed reboot procedure. Not great.

- en: After filing a ticket with Tesla to get the truck rebooted, the Cybertrucker
    went to bed and [woke up the next morning to a mostly functional truck](https://www.tiktok.com/@captian.ad/video/7358236474321505578).
    A call with Tesla confirmed that the truck had needed a complete reboot which
    took over five hours of sitting to complete. From the moment he’d initiated the
    reboot method of holding down two steering wheel buttons, the truck was apparently
    working on a reboot until some time in the middle of the night.

- en: Interestingly the user doesn’t mention whether Tesla was able to offer any insight
    as to why the truck decided to stop working, if it was caused by the car wash
    or something else entirely. The Cybertruck’s owners manual does caution against
    ever washing the truck in direct sunlight, and there is a section expressly mentioning
    that the truck has to be switched into “Car Wash Mode” before washing to avoid
    damage to parts of the vehicle.

    You never know when you’ll be left stranded waiting for the truck to sort itself
    out in five hours or so.
