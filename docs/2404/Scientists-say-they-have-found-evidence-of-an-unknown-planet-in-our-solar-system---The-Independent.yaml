    our solar system.

- en: For years, some astronomers have been suggesting that unusual behaviour on the
    edge of our solar system is best explained by another, undiscovered planet. That
    helps explain the orbits of objects that lie at the very far reaches of our solar
    system, more than 250 times away from the Sun than we are.

- en: Now Konstantin Batygin, an astronomer who helped popularise the theory, says
    that he and his team have found yet more evidence that suggests that planet exists.
    The new work represents “the strongest statistical evidence yet that [Planet 9](/topic/planet-9)
    is really out there”, he said.

    which is the technical term for those objects that sit out at the edge of the
    solar system, beyond Neptune

- en: The new work looked at those objects that have their movement made unstable
    because they interact with the orbit of Neptune. That instability meant they were
    harder to understand, so typically astronomers looking at a possible [Planet Nine](/topic/planet-nine)
    have avoided using them in their analysis.

- en: Researchers instead looked towards those objects, and tried to understand their
    movements. And, Dr Batygin claimed, the best explanation is that they result from
    another, undiscovered planet.

- en: The team carried out a host of simulations to understand how those objects’
    orbits were affected by a variety of things, including the giant planets around
    them such as Neptune, the “Galactic tide” that comes from the Milky Way, and passing
    stars.

- en: The best explanation was from the model that included Planet Nine, however,
    Dr Batygin said. They noted that there were other explanations for the behaviour
    of those objects – including the suggestion that other planets once influenced
    their orbit, but have since been removed – but claim that the theory of Planet
    Nine remains the best explanation.

    Vera C Rubin Observatory is turned on, they note. That is currently being built
    in Chile, and when it is turned on it will be able to scan the sky to understand
    the behaviour of those distant objects.

    the mysteries of our solar system’s outer reaches,” the team writes in their paper.

    TNOs by Planet Nine’, [is available now on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11594.pdf).
