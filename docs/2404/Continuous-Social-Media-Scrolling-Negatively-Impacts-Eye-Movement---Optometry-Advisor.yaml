- en: Sustained social media scrolling has a detrimental effect on eye movement, according
    to findings presented at the American Academy of Optometry 2021 annual meeting,
    held in Boston from November 3-6\. They also explored a potential link between
    oculomotor fatigue and musculoskeletal fatigue driven by the central nervous system
    following aerobic exercise.

- en: Researchers conducted a crossover study that investigated how vertical scrolling
    on social media influences vertical and horizontal saccades. Additionally, it
    explored whether there is a potential link with oculomotor fatigue or musculoskeletal
    fatigue following aerobic exercise.

- en: The study required 12 participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years to scroll
    on a social media platform for 15 minutes during 2 sessions. Using an on-board
    application, researchers measured scrolling speed, and during 1 of the sessions,
    participants cycled on a stationary bike for 15 minutes at 60% maximum heart rate.
    Vertical and horizontal saccades were measured for 1°, 3°, 5°, 7°, and 10° amplitudes
    in the up/down and left/right hemifields before and after the near task, using
    a video-based eye tracker.

- en: 'The results showed a reduction in vertical saccadic peak velocity (21% to 34%)
    that was further reduced when the near task was preceded by biking (33% to 41%).
    Also, there was an increase in saccadic inaccuracy (15% to 19%) that was further
    increased when the near task was preceded by biking (20% to 28%). Post near task,
    a similar but lesser reduction was seen in horizontal saccadic peak velocity (14%
    to 29%) as well as in horizontal saccadic gain (12% to 16%). When the near task
    was combined with biking, this effect was aggravated (peak velocity: 19% to 31%,
    inaccuracy: 16% to 21%), but there was no variability in saccadic latency across
    any experimental conditions.'

- en: The researchers explain that, while we know that the human [visual](https://www.optometryadvisor.com/systemic-disease/vf-defects-worse-in-odms-with-incomplete-bvn/)
    system is challenged by near work demands, the impact of such scrolling on the
    oculomotor system is still unclear due to the involvement of both horizontal and
    vertical eye movement when scrolling through social media feeds.

    effect on the eye movement,” the report said.
