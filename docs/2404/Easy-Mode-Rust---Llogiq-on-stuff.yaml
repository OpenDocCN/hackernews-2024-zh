- en: Rust has an only somewhat deserved reputation for being hard to learn. But that
    is mostly an unavoidable consequence of being a systems language that has to supply
    full control over the myriad of specifics of your code and runtime. But I’d argue
    that our method of teaching Rust is rather more at fault for this reputation.
    So as an antidote to this “the right way to do it” thinking, I offer this set
    of ideas on how to learn as little Rust as possible to become productive in Rust,
    so you can start and have success right away and learn the harder parts later
    when you’re comfortable with the basics.

    identify a small subset to learn that will allow people to successfully write
    Rust programs to solve the problems in front of them without being overwhelmed
    by all kinds of new concepts. I am happy to forgo on performance, brevity of the
    code or idiomatic code. In fact, some of the suggestions fly in the face of conventional
    guidelines on how good Rust code should look like. One of the questions after
    the talk was how to deal with new contributors or colleagues pushing “substandard”
    code to a project, and here my suggestion is to just merge it and clean it up
    after the fact. New users will feel unsure about their abilities, and nitpicking
    on details will put them off where we want to encourage them in their growth and
    learning, at least in the beginning.'

- en: Of course, the flipside of this is that I don’t suggest that every Rustacean
    learn only this subset and forever avoid all else. The idea here is to make you
    productive and successful quickly, and you can then build on that. A suggestion
    that also came up after my talk was to create a poster with a “research tree”
    (that is sometimes used in strategy games like e.g. Civilization to give people
    a path to progress without making it too linear). This is still on my list and
    I’ll open a repo for that soon, in the hope of finding people who’ll help me.

- en: 'Rust iterators are also very powerful, and being able to call their combinator
    functions (like `filter`, `map` etc.) you can create new iterators. There are
    only two points to be mindful of: First, the combinator functions *won’t* iterate
    anything, they will just wrap the given iterator into a new iterator type that
    will modify the iterator’s behavior, and second, the resulting types are usually
    very hard if not impossible to write out. So you should try avoiding returning
    such a custom iterator from a function, instead `collect`ing into a `Vec` or `HashMap`
    (see above). If however your iterator is infinite (yes, that can happen), you
    obviously cannot collect it. In those rare cases, here’s the magic trick to make
    it work:'
