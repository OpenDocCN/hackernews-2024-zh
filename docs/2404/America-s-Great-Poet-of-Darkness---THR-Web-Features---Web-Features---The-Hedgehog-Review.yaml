- en: 'Facing west from his white clapboard Victorian house, surrounded by acres of
    skeletally bare oak, maple, and hickory reaching up from the snow-covered New
    Hampshire woods, Robert Frost might have gazed at the granitoid solidity of Ryan’s
    Hill while he contemplated the demonic. “It was far in the sameness of the wood;
    / I was running with joy on the Demon’s trail, / Though I knew what I hunted was
    no true god,” writes Frost in a poem from his first collection, *A Boy’s Will,*
    published in 1913 when the poet was already nearly forty. Written on that farm
    in Derry, New Hampshire, while Frost was teaching at the nearby Pinkerton Academy,
    “The Demiurge’s Laugh” is uncharacteristically gothic, a thread of the supernatural
    running through this little horror story of a lyric. The narrator, disoriented
    in his errand into wilderness, hears an ever-shifting “sleepy sound, but mocking
    half,” a sound that was “all I needed to hear: / It has lasted me many and many
    a year.”'

- en: Finally, the eponymous Demiurge, the malevolent deity of the ancient Gnostics
    guilty of creating our corrupted and fallen world, “arose from his wallow to laugh,
    / Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went; / And well I knew what the Demon
    meant.” A Demiurge would naturally be of interest to a poet, especially an inheritor
    of a Romantic tradition that would place significance on such things, but the
    entire forested scene is a bit more eldritch than what we expect from the good,
    gray poet of the New England woods. It shouldn’t be. Although it’s true that such
    imagery is fit more for Hawthorne or Lovecraft than a Modernist poet, Frost remains
    one of the greatest literary enumerators of a particularly modern darkness, regardless
    of his reputation (among those who refuse to read him carefully) of being a jingle
    man out of step with the prosodic conventions of the twentieth century. Now, on
    the 150th anniversary of his birth, it’s worth considering that Frost is our great
    American poet of darkness.

    standing, even sixty-one years after his death, remains blue-chip, still perhaps
    the most famous American poet among the general public. Frost’s work remains anthologized
    and interpreted, and taught in secondary and undergraduate classrooms; his lyrics
    among the handful that can be expected to be namedropped as a reader’s favorite
    poem (two roads and all of that). If anything, Frost has suffered from the albatross
    of presumed *accessibility.* Among the luminaries of American Modernism, Ezra
    Pound was experimental, T.S. Eliot cerebral, H.D. hermetic, Langston Hughes revolutionary,
    Wallace Stevens incandescent, and William Carlos Williams visionary, but Frost
    is *readable.* David Orr writes in his excellent book-length close reading *The
    Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone
    Gets Wrong* (2015) that Frost is a poet whose “signature phrases have become so
    ubiquitous, so much a part of everything from coffee mugs to refrigerator magnets
    to graduation speeches” that it can become easy to forget the man who penned such
    phrases.'

  zh: 尽管有被视为诗歌界诺曼·洛克威尔的刻板印象，罗伯特·弗罗斯特的地位，在他去世六十一年后，仍然是蓝筹股，或许在大众中仍然是最著名的美国诗人。弗罗斯特的作品仍然被选编和解读，并在中学和大学课堂上教授；他的诗歌成为少数几首可能被提及为读者最喜爱的诗歌之一（两条路和所有这些）。如果有什么不同的话，弗罗斯特遭受了被视为“易读性”的包袱。在美国现代主义的杰出人物中，埃兹拉·庞德是实验性的，T.S.艾略特是理性的，H.D.是密封的，朗斯顿·休斯是革命性的，华莱士·史蒂文斯是闪耀的，威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯是有远见的，但弗罗斯特是“可读的”。大卫·奥尔在他出色的书籍《未选择的道路：在几乎所有人都错误理解的诗中找到美国》（2015）中写道，弗罗斯特是一位诗人，他的“标志性短语变得如此普遍，成为一切从咖啡杯到冰箱磁铁再到毕业演讲的一部分”，以至于很容易忘记撰写这些短语的人。
- en: Because he was a committed formalist—not just an enthusiast of meter, but of
    rhyme for heaven’s sake—Frost has rightly or wrongly been categorized as an unrepentant
    poetic irredentist, a temperamental conservative in a movement enthralled to Ezra
    Pound’s exhortation to “Make it new.” That Frost was an immaculate conveyer of
    traditional literary forms—no jingle man but rather a subtle deployer of meter
    and rhyme, of rhythm and enjambment—doesn’t exonerate his formalism for some critics,
    and for others might even make it worse. A poet who was slurred in a 1936 edition
    of *The Saturday Review of Literature *by the (now-forgotten) critic William Rose
    Benét as being merely a “wise old woodchuck,” perhaps worthy of his four Pulitzers,
    but thankfully never given a Nobel. This is the maudlin straw-poet of snowy blanketed
    New England fields and of mossy stone cairns, the sentimentalist of autumnal orange
    and summer’s first green being gold; this is the saccharine Poet Laureate of Vermont,
    the favored homespun bard of President John F. Kennedy enlisted to read at the
    1960 inauguration, and who recited his verse from memory after being blinded by
    the sunny brightness of a Washington January. The poet incongruously born in California
    (of all places!) who through sheer-force-of-will molded himself into the voice
    of New England, for whom the land was his before he was the land’s. A regionally
    rusticated American pastoralist fit for inspirational posters and needlepoint.

  zh: 因为他是一个忠实的形式主义者——不仅是韵律的热衷者，而且是押韵的支持者——弗罗斯特被认为或许不正确地被分类为一个不后悔的诗歌民族主义者，一个在被埃兹拉·庞德鼓舞的运动中作为情绪保守派的人物。“创造新事物。”弗罗斯特作为传统文学形式的完美传递者——不是简单的俏皮诗人，而是一位细致运用韵律和押韵，节奏和跨行的诗人——对于一些评论家来说，并不能为他的形式主义辩护，对于其他人来说甚至可能使情况变得更糟。在1936年的《文学星期六评论》的一期中，诗评家威廉·罗斯·贝内特（现已被遗忘）谩骂弗罗斯特只是一个“聪明的老土拨鼠”，也许他的四个普利策奖是值得的，但幸好他从未获得过诺贝尔奖。这是新英格兰雪白的草原和苔藓石垛的哀思诗人，秋季橙色和夏天初绿变为金黄的多愁善感诗人；这是佛蒙特州的糖蜜诗人，约翰·F·肯尼迪总统的最喜欢的家常诗人，被选为1960年就职典礼的朗诵者，在被威尔明顿一月的阳光明媚所致失明后，依然能够从记忆中背诵他的诗歌。这位出生于加利福尼亚的诗人（不可思议的是！）通过意志力雕刻成新英格兰的声音，对他而言，这片土地属于他在他成为这片土地之前。一个适合鼓舞人心海报和针织品的区域乡村美好诗人。
- en: '“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, /
    And that has made all the difference.” Arguably the most famous three lines in
    American poetry, the one peppered in any number of graduation speeches or yearbook
    quotations, but also a fit metonymy for Frost’s reception history, because, as
    Orr writes*,* “Most readers consider ‘The Road Not Taken’ to be a paean to triumphant
    self-assertion…but the literal meaning of the poem’s own lines seem completely
    at odds with this interpretation.” Orr describes how Frost’s popularity has made
    him exist on two parallel but separate levels: one, the corncob bard of Yankee
    wisdom who appears on t-shirts and mugs: the other, the critic’s darling who is
    “bleak, dark, complex, and manipulative.” The latter, it should be affirmed, is
    the accurate reading of Frost. As Orr (and probably your college English professor)
    explains, “The Road Not Taken” has nothing to do with inspiration and stick-to-it-iveness;
    rather it’s a melancholic exhalation at the futility of choice, a dirge about
    enduring in the face of meaninglessness. If you read Frost for the snow, but don’t
    feel the cold, then you’re not really reading Frost. Furthermore, I’d argue that
    Frost’s vision isn’t just contrary to the popular misconception of him, but that
    as an American poet he deserves to be categorized as among those with the darkest
    of visions, not because of those demonic images he played with in his freshman
    effort, but because he abandoned such ghouls and gremlins in genuflection before
    the actual hardness of this world.'

  zh: “两条路分别通向树林，而我— / 我选择了少走的一条， / 那改变了一切。” 这可以说是美国诗歌中最著名的三行，是任何数量的毕业演讲或年鉴引语中的重要元素，但也是弗罗斯特接受历史的完美比喻，因为如奥尔所述，“大多数读者认为‘未选的道路’是一首颂扬胜利的自我主张…但是，诗歌的字面意义与这一解释完全不符。”
    奥尔描述了弗罗斯特的流行使他存在于两个平行但分离的层面上：一方面，是美国智慧的玉米芯诗人，出现在T恤和马克杯上；另一方面，是评论家的宠儿，是“黑暗、复杂和操纵性的”。
    应当肯定的是，后者才是对弗罗斯特的正确阅读。 正如奥尔（也许是你的大学英语教授）所解释的那样，“未选的道路”与灵感和坚持不懈无关；相反，它是对选择无意义的悲伤呼吸，是面对无意义中的坚持的哀歌。
    如果你读弗罗斯特是因为雪，但不感受到寒冷，那么你并不真正读懂弗罗斯特。 此外，我认为弗罗斯特的愿景不仅与他的流行误解相反，而且作为美国诗人，他应被归类为那些具有最黑暗愿景的诗人之一，不是因为他在他的新手尝试中玩弄这些鬼怪，而是因为他在这个世界的实际坚硬面前放弃了这样的鬼怪。
- en: “I cannot rub the strangeness from my sleep”—1914\. “‘Don’t let him cut my hand
    off… Don’t let him, sister!’”—1916\. “Some say the world will end in fire,/Some
    say in ice”—1923\. “A voice said, Look me in the stars / And tell me truly, men
    of earth, / If all the soul-and-body scars / Were not too much to pay for birth”—1942\.
    Then there is his *mea culpa* from a 1928 issue of *The Virginia Quarterly Review*—“I
    have been one acquainted with the night.” There is no supernatural terror in Frost’s
    poetry, he’s far too mature for that. What animates Frost’s darkness is precisely
    the same thing which many of his most fervent public readers superficially perseverate
    on, and that’s his abiding sense of realism. He is nothing if not a pragmatic
    poet (that demiurge aside) and it’s life itself, in all of its undeniable finitude,
    that supplies the poet’s most potent fears. The moral universe of a Frost poem
    might include the arbitrariness of life, the continual threat of accident, the
    singularity of the isolated soul, and always our trepidation toward the grave.
    Death alone—in the finality of its extinctions and its infinite blackness—is far
    more horrifying than any chimera dreamt up in weird fiction. The Yankee poet has
    murdered the Puritan God, and then must live with the aftermath—our condition
    now as silent as fresh snow lightly falling on a field, as dark as the woods two
    hours after midnight.

    / 告诉我，地球的人们， / 如果所有的灵魂和身体的疤痕 / 难道不是为了生命的代价吗？”—1942年。然后是他在1928年《弗吉尼亚季刊评论》中的*我错了*—“我与夜有所熟悉。”
    弗罗斯特的诗歌中没有超自然的恐怖，他对此太过成熟。 弗罗斯特黑暗中的活力正是他最热情的公共读者表面上坚持的事物，那就是他持久的现实感。 他无非是一个实用主义的诗人（那个世界的创造者）的生活本身，而不是生命本身的无可否认的有限性，供应诗人最有效的恐惧。
    一首弗罗斯特诗歌的道德宇宙可能包括生命的任意性，意外的持续威胁，孤立灵魂的独特性，以及我们对坟墓的畏惧。 死亡本身—在其灭绝的最终性和其无限的黑暗中—比任何在怪异小说中想象的幻影更可怕。
    美国诗人已经杀死了清教徒上帝，然后必须与事后生活相处—我们现在的状态就像轻轻落在田野上的新雪一样沉默，就像午夜后两个小时的森林一样黑暗。
- en: That imagery (among other poems, obviously) is replete in one of Frost’s most
    celebrated poems, “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” included in his 1923
    collection *New Hampshire.* As with the poet at his darkest, this lyric can operate
    on two levels—the homespun and the existential, with the superficial charm of
    the narrative purposefully occluding the full implications of the poem’s narrative.
    The poem’s narrator is a solitary wagon-driver making his way toward dawn, like
    Dante at the beginning of *The Divine Comedy,* having found himself in a dark
    wood. Pausing within the forest, the narrator watches the snow quietly fall; a
    pause that unnerves his steadfast horse who “must think it queer / To stop without
    a farmhouse near / Between the woods and frozen lake / The darkest evening of
    the year,” with that last line evoking everything from John Donne’s “A Nocturne
    Upon St. Lucy’s Day” to St. John of the Cross’s description of the “dark night
    of the soul.” Finally, the narrator reflects that the “woods are lovely, dark
    and deep, / But I have promises to keep / And miles to go before I sleep, / And
    miles to go before I sleep.”

  zh: 那种意象（当然还有其他诗歌）充斥在弗罗斯特最著名的诗歌之一，“停驻在雪夜的树林边”中，收录于他1923年的集合*新罕布什尔*中。与诗人在他最黑暗时一样，这首抒情诗可以在两个层面上运作——朴素的迷人叙事有意掩盖了诗歌叙事的全部含义。诗中的叙述者是一个孤独的马车夫，朝着黎明前行，就像《神曲》开头的但丁一样，置身于一片黑暗的树林中。在森林中暂停时，叙述者静静地看着雪悄悄落下；这种停顿让他坚定的马感到不安，“一定觉得奇怪
    / 在没有农舍的地方停下来 / 在树林和冰冻的湖之间 / 是一年中最黑暗的夜晚”，而最后一行唤起了从约翰·唐恩的“圣卢西亚日夜间曲”到圣十字若望对“灵魂黑夜”的描述的一切。最后，叙述者反思道“树林美丽，黑暗而深远，/
    但我有诺言要守，/ 我还有几里路要走，/ 我还有几里路要走。”
- en: Frost maintained that the poem wasn’t about suicide deferred, but it’s hard
    not to read “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” as concerning self-annihilation
    (albeit self-annihilation avoided). It’s that “But” that starts the second line
    of the final stanza that is the poem’s turn, for why place such an interjection
    after the observation of the dark, lovely finality of the woods, of that frozen
    lake so amenable to drowning oneself, if only then to reaffirm that here are promises
    to keep, miles to go before he sleeps, responsibilities and duties that must be
    fulfilled before death can be entertained? The poem’s rhyme scheme is simultaneously
    simple without ever being obvious, while the soft, unfolding trickle of end-stopped
    sounds concludes with that quatrain where every line ends in the same rhyme, feeling
    as if you’re being lulled to sleep, as if you’re peacefully freezing to death.
    “And so far from being obvious, optimistic, [or] orthodox,” writes the poet Randall
    Jarrell in his 1953 landmark essay that did so much to rehabilitate Frost among
    scholars, “many of these poems are extraordinarily subtle and strange, poems which
    express an attitude that, at its most extreme, makes pessimism seem a hopeful
    evasion.”

  zh: 弗罗斯特坚称这首诗不是关于推迟自杀的，但很难不把“停驻在雪夜的树林边”理解为关于自我毁灭（尽管是避免的自我毁灭）。正是那个“但”字开始了最后一节的第二行，这是诗的转折点，因为在观察到树林的黑暗、美丽的终结以及那片适合淹死自己的冰冻湖后，为什么要在此之后加上这样的插话，只是为了再次确认这里有诺言要守，还有几里路要走，必须在可以考虑死亡之前履行的责任和义务？诗的押韵方案同时简单而不显而易见，而尾韵音的柔和、展开的流动感在每行都以相同的押韵结束的四行诗中结束，感觉就像你被哄骗入睡，就像你在安详地冻死。“因此，远非显而易见的、乐观的、正统的，”诗人兰德尔·贾雷尔在他1953年的具有里程碑意义的论文中写道，这篇论文在学术界为弗罗斯特做了很多修复工作，“这些诗中有很多是异常微妙和奇怪的诗，表达了一种极端态度，使悲观主义看起来像是一种希望的逃避。”
- en: Frost has little in the manner of sectarian concerns across his corpus, but
    his verse was hardly devoid of the theological, of a sense of the numinous. Despite
    (perhaps with tongue in cheek) describing himself variously as an “Old Testament
    Christian” and as an “old dissenter,” organized religion held little appeal for
    Frost. His family’s immediate milieu was Unitarian and Presbyterian, while he
    was baptized in the idiosyncratic denomination of the New Church, founded by Emanuel
    Swedenborg in the eighteenth-century (among the faiths which fascinated both William
    Blake and Joseph Smith, incidentally). Ultimately, Frost’s belief was to take
    unbelief seriously, for as he declared in a 1946 Cincinnati lecture, “irreligion
    was worse than atheism.” This is to say that Frost took questions of faith—of
    mortality, morality, and meaning—seriously, regardless of the answers. What that
    answer was, for Frost, more often than not, was an awful silence.

  zh: 在他的作品中，弗罗斯特在宗派上几乎没有什么关注，但他的诗歌并不缺乏神学的成分，也不缺乏一种神秘感。尽管（或许是带着调侃的口吻），他曾自称为“旧约基督徒”和“老异议者”，但有组织的宗教对弗罗斯特几乎没有吸引力。他的家庭周围的环境是单位教和长老会，而他受洗于新教会这一异端派别，该派别由18世纪的伊曼纽尔·斯威登堡创立（顺便提一下，这些信仰曾让威廉·布莱克和约瑟夫·史密斯着迷）。最终，弗罗斯特的信仰是认真对待不信仰，正如他在1946年辛辛那提的讲座中宣称的那样，“不信仰比无神论更糟糕。”
    这意味着弗罗斯特认真地对待信仰问题 - 死亡、道德和意义问题，无论答案是什么。对于弗罗斯特来说，那个答案往往是一片可怕的沉默。
- en: In his 1914 “A Loose Mountain,” Frost contemplates the terrible distances between
    stars in the cosmos, but concludes that “They cannot scare me with their empty
    spaces / Between stars—on stars where no human race is. / I have it in me so much
    nearer home / To scare myself with my own desert places.” Frost is the darkest
    of poets because he is the most honest of poets, he is the most realistic. As
    he wrote in a letter, there are “no vampires, no ghouls, no demons, nothing but
    me.” There is no need for the Demiurge when death itself will do. This is not
    a universe without hope, however, for Frost’s Yankee existentialism doesn’t degenerate
    into Yankee nihilism because he finds the possibility of self-constructed meaning
    in the power of work (mending fences, chopping wood, writing poems). There is
    significance in the quotidian, where after the death of God the only grace is
    in the material estimation of life, in work. With Frost, the Protestant ethic
    of his ancestors has finally converted faith back into works, where in an inert
    and dead universe all that can stave off nothingness is that which you can hold
    in your hands, build with your hands. Everything else is but the most perilous
    abstraction, while the rest is the most sublime darkness.

    / 我有它更接近家园 / 用我的自己的荒原去吓唬我自己。” 弗罗斯特是最黑暗的诗人，因为他是最诚实的诗人，他是最现实的。正如他在一封信中写道，那里“没有吸血鬼，没有食尸鬼，没有恶魔，只有我自己。”
    当死亡本身足以胜任时，根本不需要至高神。然而，这不是一个没有希望的宇宙，因为弗罗斯特的美国人存在主义并没有堕落为虚无主义，因为他在工作的力量中发现了自我建构的可能性（修补栅栏，砍木头，写诗）。在日常生活中有重要意义，在上帝死后，唯一的恩典就在于对生命的物质评估，即工作。与弗罗斯特一同，他祖先的新教伦理最终将信仰转变为行为，在一个惰性和死亡的宇宙中，唯一能够抵御虚无的是你可以用手持有，用手建造的东西。其他一切都是最危险的抽象，而剩下的则是最崇高的黑暗。
