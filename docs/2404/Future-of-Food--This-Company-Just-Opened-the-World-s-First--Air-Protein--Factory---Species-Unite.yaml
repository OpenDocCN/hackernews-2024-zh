    beans, and legumes. Others are creating ‘real’ cultivated meat, in a process that
    typically takes animal cells and cultivates - or grows - them in a laboratory
    setting, not dissimilar to the way that beer is fermented.

    unique approach to making a more sustainable food system: growing protein out

- en: The company has just opened the world’s first air protein factory, based near
    the Finnish capital of Helsinki. At the facility, Solar Foods will operate a commercial-scale
    production of Solein, its signature air protein, which combines a tiny but mighty
    micro-organism with CO2 - known simply as air - to grow it into a nutritious yellow
    powder. The bioprocess is said to resemble winemaking.

    with a wide range of traditional ingredients - it’s already been made into limited-edition
    food products like a Solein-powered snack bar and a Solein chocolate gelato.
