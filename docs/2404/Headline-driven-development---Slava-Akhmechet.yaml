- en: Here is a simple process for shipping software projects that works. First, decompose
    the project into a stream of headlines. Then pick an aggressive date to ship the
    first headline and work like hell to meet that date. Have everyone work only on
    one headline at a time– the upcoming one. Ignore everything else. Don’t work on
    anything that doesn’t help you ship the headline. Once the headline is shipped,
    switch to the next headline in the stream and repeat. That’s all, you can fire
    your agile consultant.

    with all the other bits culled. Imagine you bump into someone on the street after
    not having seen them for a few months and they ask what you’ve been up to. What
    kinds of responses work well in this situation? “I trekked through Southeast Asia”,
    “I switched jobs”, “I got married”. Software release headlines work the same way.
    “You can now rent VMs through an API”, “we rolled out FSD autopilot”, “Treasury
    is available in India”.

- en: First, headlines is how humans process change. If you ever found your users
    confused, your boss frustrated, your investors anxious, your peers indifferent–
    these problems go away when you organize communication around a stream of headlines.
    But it doesn’t work as an afterthought. Communicating through headlines but developing
    in some other way is like leading a double life. It gets too messy. So to communicate
    with headlines you must develop with headlines too.

    a headline without something, cut that something. For example, suppose you’re
    working on your Southeast Asia trek headline and you’re planning to visit six
    countries. Can you credibly say to your friends “I trekked through Southeast Asia”
    only having visited five countries instead of six? Obviously yes. So one of the
    countries gets cut. How about four countries? Repeatedly go through this exercise
    and stop before the credibility of the headline is at risk. You want to do the
    minimum possible amount of work that still leaves the headline credible.

    before the project is due. The industry isn’t that different. So simulating class
    assignments turns out to be a very effective way to ship quickly. You need a discrete
    chunk of work, with an arbitrary deadline, and a binary outcome. You get this
    with headlines– a headline has either shipped by a given timestamp or it hasn’t.
