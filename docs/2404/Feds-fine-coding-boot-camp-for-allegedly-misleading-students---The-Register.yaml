    allegedly claiming overoptimistic hiring rates for BloomTech graduates. BloomTech,
    formerly Lambda School, has operated since 2017 and offers six- to nine-month

    School，自2017年以来一直运营，并提供为期六至九个月的科学和工程职业项目，重点是计算机技术。

    were marketed as risk-free, but in fact carried significant finance charges and
    many of the same risks as other credit products," said Rohit Chopra, director
    of the CFPB. With income share loans or income share agreements, BloomTech allowed
    students to pay tuition later but in exchange had to pay a percentage of their
    future income, CFPB claimed.'

    loans (which cost an average of $4k "finance charge" to use) weren't actually
    loans at all. The CFPB claimed in the settlement [order](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bloomtech-inc-consent-order_2024-04.pdf)

    breaking its promise to "only make money when you [students] do." On top of that,
    the CFPB claimed BloomTech broke the Holder Rule by neglecting to afford students
    certain rights when it sold loans to investors, which is illegal according to
    the consumer protection watchdog.

    more than 18 months ago and don't work a job making more than $70k a year. Plus,

  zh: BloomTech面临于严重的制裁。它不再能够从在过去一年内未能获得工作的毕业生处收取收入共享贷款的款项，还需取消超过18个月前毕业的、年薪低于70,000美元的学生的数千美元贷款费用。此外，当前学生必须能够解除贷款并退学，或在继续就读的前提下能使用第三方贷款。
- en: As an added bonus, BloomTech and Allred personally have to pay into the CFPB's
    victims' relief fund, with the company getting fined $64k and the CEO $100k. Plus,
    Allred is prohibited from student lending for a decade. Given that a single student
    could pay up to $30k on a single shared income loan, the fines probably aren't
    the biggest financial pain for the coding institution.
