    yesterday, the CFPB said it had taken action against BloomTech and its CEO Austen
    Allred for allegedly not disclosing the true cost of its loans to students and
    allegedly claiming overoptimistic hiring rates for BloomTech graduates. BloomTech,
    formerly Lambda School, has operated since 2017 and offers six- to nine-month
    vocational programs in science and engineering, with a focus on computer technology.

    were marketed as risk-free, but in fact carried significant finance charges and
    many of the same risks as other credit products," said Rohit Chopra, director
    of the CFPB. With income share loans or income share agreements, BloomTech allowed
    students to pay tuition later but in exchange had to pay a percentage of their
    future income, CFPB claimed.'

    loans (which cost an average of $4k "finance charge" to use) weren't actually
    loans at all. The CFPB claimed in the settlement [order](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bloomtech-inc-consent-order_2024-04.pdf)
    [PDF] a "significant majority" of students used these loans to finance their education,
    and alleged each student could end up paying up to $30k of their income to BloomTech
    to settle the loans.

    breaking its promise to "only make money when you [students] do." On top of that,
    the CFPB claimed BloomTech broke the Holder Rule by neglecting to afford students
    certain rights when it sold loans to investors, which is illegal according to
    the consumer protection watchdog.

    fanciful hiring rates for its graduates between 71 and 86 percent, when in reality
    the actual rate was around 50 percent but sometimes as low as 30 percent, which
    BloomTech disclosed to investors in a "non public" report, claimed the filing.
    The document alleged that in one instance, CEO Austen Allred said that one cohort
    had a 100 percent hiring rate, but then later clarified it was in a cohort of
    just a single student.

    and has to cancel the multi-thousand dollar finance charge for students who graduated
    more than 18 months ago and don't work a job making more than $70k a year. Plus,
    current students must be allowed to drop their loans and withdraw, or be able
    to continue attending but with a third-party loan.

  zh: BloomTech面临于严重的制裁。它不再能够从在过去一年内未能获得工作的毕业生处收取收入共享贷款的款项，还需取消超过18个月前毕业的、年薪低于70,000美元的学生的数千美元贷款费用。此外，当前学生必须能够解除贷款并退学，或在继续就读的前提下能使用第三方贷款。
- en: As an added bonus, BloomTech and Allred personally have to pay into the CFPB's
    victims' relief fund, with the company getting fined $64k and the CEO $100k. Plus,
    Allred is prohibited from student lending for a decade. Given that a single student
    could pay up to $30k on a single shared income loan, the fines probably aren't
    the biggest financial pain for the coding institution.

  zh: 此外，BloomTech和奥尔德尔个人必须向CFPB的受害者救济基金缴纳罚款，公司罚款64,000美元，CEO罚款100,000美元。奥尔德尔被禁止从事学生贷款业务达十年之久。给单个学生的一笔收入共享贷款可能要高达30,000美元，所以罚款对编码机构的财务影响可能不是最大的。
