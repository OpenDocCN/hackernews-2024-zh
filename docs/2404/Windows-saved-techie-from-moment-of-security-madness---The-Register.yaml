- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Declan" who describes himself as
    "a designer working with CAD to design machines" – but one with enough technical
    nous that he essentially taught himself how to use the software. Indeed, at his
    first job in the '90s he was considered the "technical guy" and the go-to for
    support.

  zh: 本周，我们见到了一位我们将称之为“德克兰”的读者，他自称是“通过CAD设计机器的设计师”——但他的技术洞察力足够，使他基本上自学了如何使用软件。确实，在他90年代的第一份工作中，他被视为“技术人员”和支持的首选。
- en: The consultancy he was working for had a bunch of Windows machines, a few Unix
    boxes – mostly from Sun and Silicon Graphics – plus one Digital Alpha RISC machine,
    running the special cut of Windows NT Microsoft made for those boxes. For those
    who don't remember that short-lived project, it was basically Microsoft's half-hearted
    gesture to the idea that there were non-Intel processors in the world. Most of
    the work on porting NT to Alpha was done by Digital, and when that firm was bought
    by Compaq the dream was over.

  zh: 他所服务的咨询公司有一堆Windows机器，几台Unix盒子——大多数来自Sun和Silicon Graphics——还有一台数字Alpha RISC机器，运行着专门为这些盒子打造的Windows
    NT的特殊版本。对于那些不记得这个短命项目的人来说，它基本上是微软对于世界上有非英特尔处理器这个想法的半心半意的回应。大部分将NT移植到Alpha架构的工作由Digital完成，当这家公司被康柏收购时，这个梦想也宣告结束。
- en: Anyway, long story short, Windows NT ran on Alpha, but not hugely well, and
    there were virtually no native applications for it – almost everything ran in
    emulation. However at the time the 500MHz Alpha was sufficiently speedy that performance
    was adequate. That was the machine Declan used.

  zh: 总之，长话短说，Windows NT能在Alpha架构上运行，但效果不是很好，并且几乎没有本地应用程序——几乎所有东西都在仿真中运行。然而，当时的500MHz
    Alpha处理器足够快，性能是足够的。这就是德克兰使用的机器。
- en: Declan's varied duties (on top of his CAD work) had him installing Windows,
    supporting the network, and above all trying to stop his co-workers spreading
    viruses.

  zh: 在他的CAD工作之外，德克兰还有各种各样的职责，包括安装Windows、支持网络，尤其是尝试阻止他的同事传播病毒。
- en: Declan understood that a virus hitting his employer's network would probably
    bring work to a halt, because the antivirus software of the time was mostly updated
    only after infections were widespread. He was therefore most diligent in instructing
    everyone to be cautious about opening attachments or unfamiliar files from untrusted
    sources.

  zh: 德克兰明白，一旦病毒侵袭雇主的网络，可能会导致工作陷入停顿，因为当时的防病毒软件大多在感染广泛后才更新。因此，他在指导每个人对来自不信任来源的附件或陌生文件要谨慎打开方面非常勤奋。

    spreadsheet. Thinking it looked legit enough, he double-clicked to open it.

  zh: 一个疲惫、紧张的下午，德克兰收到了一封包含Excel电子表格的电子邮件。他认为看起来足够合法，于是双击打开了它。
- en: Immediately his screen was obscured by error messages. He panicked, realizing
    that the spreadsheet must have contained a macro virus. Then he realized that
    he was about to take the company down by doing exactly what he warned everyone
    else not to do. Oh, the shame! The humiliation!

  zh: 他的屏幕立即被错误信息遮盖。他感到恐慌，意识到电子表格必定包含宏病毒。然后他意识到，他正打算通过做任何事情来带领公司崩溃，而这正是他警告其他人不要做的事情。哦，羞耻！耻辱！

  zh: 不过，片刻之后，当他阅读错误信息时，他感到一种平静降临在他身上。
- en: The spreadsheet was indeed infected. However, the worm it contained was designed
    to open the recipient's contact list in Outlook and send itself to everyone, thus
    perpetuating its spread – for no reason other than to spread further.

- en: What this worm had not counted on was that Declan was running both Excel and
    Outlook in emulation, and the integration between them in that environment was
    so poor that it couldn't work. The worm kept trying to create emails and send
    them, but failed every single time.
