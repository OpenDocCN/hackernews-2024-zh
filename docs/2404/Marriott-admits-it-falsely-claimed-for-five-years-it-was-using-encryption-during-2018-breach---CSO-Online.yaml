- en: Marriott did not issue a news release, nor did it flag the change on its homepage.
    Instead, it added two sentences to a page on its website from Jan. 4, 2019\. The
    only way for consumers, shareholders, reporters or anyone else to see it is if
    they happened to click on [the five-year-old page](https://news.marriott.com/news/2019/01/04/marriott-provides-update-on-starwood-database-security-incident).

  zh: Marriott没有发布新闻稿，也没有在其主页上标记此更改。相反，它在2019年1月4日的网页上添加了两句话。要看到这些内容，消费者、股东、记者或其他任何人只能偶然点击[这个五年前的页面](https://news.marriott.com/news/2019/01/04/marriott-provides-update-on-starwood-database-security-incident)。
- en: 'The two-sentence update reads: “Following an investigation with several leading
    data security experts, Marriott initially determined that the payment card numbers
    and certain passport numbers in the database tables involved in the Starwood database
    security incident that Marriott reported on November 30, 2018, were protected
    using Advanced Encryption Standard 128 encryption (AES-128). Marriott has now
    determined that the payment card numbers and some of the passport numbers in those
    tables were instead protected with a different cryptographic method known as Secure
    Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1).”'

  zh: 更新的两句话如下：“在与几位领先的数据安全专家进行调查后，Marriott最初确定涉及Starwood数据库安全事件的数据库表中的付款卡号和某些护照号码是受到高级加密标准128位（AES-128）加密保护的。Marriott现已确定，这些表中的付款卡号和部分护照号码实际上是使用了一种名为安全哈希算法1（SHA-1）的不同加密方法来保护。”

  zh: Marriott并未说明为何错误地声称其使用了AES-128加密技术。
- en: Marriott has thus far not answered any of the critical questions surrounding
    the admission. What made the company initially think that it had used AES-128,
    assuming that it did indeed believe that? After forensic investigations by outside
    firms — including Accenture, Verizon, and CrowdStrike — how did no one notice
    that there in fact had been no encryption in place? And if they did notice, why
    was Marriott repeating the false encryption claim? Perhaps most importantly, when
    and how did Marriott discover the truth?

  zh: Marriott至今尚未回答有关这一承认的任何关键问题。公司最初为何认为自己使用了AES-128，假设确实如此？在由外部公司（包括埃森哲、Verizon和CrowdStrike）进行的取证调查之后，为什么没有人注意到实际上并没有加密技术存在？如果他们确实注意到了，为什么Marriott还在重复错误的加密声明？或许更重要的是，Marriott是何时以及如何发现了真相？
