- en: Marriott did not issue a news release, nor did it flag the change on its homepage.
    Instead, it added two sentences to a page on its website from Jan. 4, 2019\. The
    only way for consumers, shareholders, reporters or anyone else to see it is if
    they happened to click on [the five-year-old page](https://news.marriott.com/news/2019/01/04/marriott-provides-update-on-starwood-database-security-incident).

- en: 'The two-sentence update reads: “Following an investigation with several leading
    data security experts, Marriott initially determined that the payment card numbers
    and certain passport numbers in the database tables involved in the Starwood database
    security incident that Marriott reported on November 30, 2018, were protected
    using Advanced Encryption Standard 128 encryption (AES-128). Marriott has now
    determined that the payment card numbers and some of the passport numbers in those
    tables were instead protected with a different cryptographic method known as Secure
    Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1).”'

- en: Marriott has thus far not answered any of the critical questions surrounding
    the admission. What made the company initially think that it had used AES-128,
    assuming that it did indeed believe that? After forensic investigations by outside
    firms — including Accenture, Verizon, and CrowdStrike — how did no one notice
    that there in fact had been no encryption in place? And if they did notice, why
    was Marriott repeating the false encryption claim? Perhaps most importantly, when
    and how did Marriott discover the truth?
