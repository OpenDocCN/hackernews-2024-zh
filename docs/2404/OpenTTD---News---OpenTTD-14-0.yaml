    isn’t. There are so many new goodies in 14.0, that I don’t even know where to
    start! Let’s go over a few, just to get you a feel for what to expect when you
    launch OpenTTD 14.0.

- en: It is now possible to make the calendar time walk slower, up to a point it is
    frozen. This doesn’t influence vehicle movement at all, nor the amount of goods
    transported, town growth, etc. But it does influence vehicle introduction dates,
    inflation, and aging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to have more time to build out their empire before vehicles expire, inflation
    gets too big, etc.

    over vast distances without the need for buoys. In fact, one could say, you don’t
    need buoys anymore at all. The ships will still find their way!

    your best to ensure you send them out the depot with a good distance between them.

    is not, OpenTTD now has an opt-in survey tool built-in. Over time this will allow
    us, developers, to better understand how OpenTTD is played, so we can better anticipate
    what will be a hit or a miss.

    Fixing pixel-errors, moving things around a bit, fixing colouring issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But .. not less important, we now also have a built-in scalable font! Zephyris
    created a real (TTF) font heavily inspired by the sprite font. This means that
    scaling looks a lot better, especially for zoom levels like 1.5x.

    you can revert to the sprite font if you really want to).

    through the basic information of the game. Bringing information closer to the
    user, and the game more accessible to everyone, has been a path we have been on
    for a while.

    settings have had their defaults changed, mostly towards enabling modern features
    by default.

- en: 'Lastly, we also renamed Cheats to Sandbox. We noticed people were struggling
    with using “cheats”, as we have been conditioned that cheats in games are bad.
    But Cheats in OpenTTD context is much more “play how you like” (read: Sandbox).
    So we renamed it, hopefully making it more clear to new players that it is perfectly
    okay to use these Sandbox options any time they like.'
