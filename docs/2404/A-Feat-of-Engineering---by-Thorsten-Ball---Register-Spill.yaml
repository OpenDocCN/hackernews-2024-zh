    story in. Usually I start with “did you know that Apple…?” and end by leaning
    back in the chair, my index finger pointing at the table, and me saying “… now
    that’s engineering.”

    A minor release that didn’t include any major features but something else:'

    today. Within iOS 10.3, Apple is moving supported devices to its new Apple File
    System (APFS).

    users” — already hundreds of millions in 2017 — and “user’s won’t notice a difference.”

    like that because my personal success rate with file system changes isn’t the
    greatest. Multiple times in the past I’ve accidentally destroyed Linux and Windows
    installations by messing something up on the CLI. But personal clumsiness aside:
    whenever you touch the file system you have to acknowledge there’s a very real
    chance you brick your machine. It doesn’t get a lot more load-bearing than the
    file system.'

    command and a team at Apple writing a file system migrator: for one, they know
    what a file system actually is, but they also wrote the new file system, have
    experience migrating from the old to the new one, probably test their migrator
    for multiple months on hundreds or thousands of testing devices, have excellent
    tooling for such migrations, and can lean on the experience that Apple as a company
    has with automatically updating iOS devices.'

    their file system migration would end up bricking devices were probably very,
    very slim. Near zero, possibly zero.'

- en: 'But, still. Take near-zero and multiply it with hundreds of millions and I
    ask you: would you click the button that rolls out that update? How much testing
    would you want to do before you press it? How many test devices? How many different
    configurations? I don’t know how to answer these questions with anything except
    “a lot”, but I do know this: more than sweat would leave my body before clicking
    that button.'

- en: They did click that button and the update rolled out and it migrated hundreds
    of millions of devices, over night, and as far as I know no device was bricked
    and only a few even noticed that something happened.
