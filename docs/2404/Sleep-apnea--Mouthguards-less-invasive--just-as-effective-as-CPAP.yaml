  zh: 阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停症可能导致或加重高血压，因此一项新研究检查了哪种睡眠呼吸暂停症治疗方法——CPAP机或保持气道开放的咬合器——在降低血压方面更有效。
- en: Medications are the first-line treatment for high blood pressure, otherwise
    known as hypertension. However, [obstructive sleep apnea](https://newatlas.com/medical/nasal-spray-sleep-apnea/)
    (OSA), which can cause and/or exacerbate [hypertension](https://newatlas.com/medical/new-drug-two-for-one-treatment-heart-failure-sleep-apnea/),
    is being recognized as an underdiagnosed and modifiable risk factor. The most
    common sleep-rated breathing disorder, OSA is caused by the collapse of the upper
    airway during sleep, which leads to frequent sleep interruptions, up to 30 times
    an hour, all night long.

- en: Continuous positive airway pressure ([CPAP](https://newatlas.com/medical/health-benefits-cpap-acid-reflux/))
    delivered via a face or nasal mask is often used to treat OSA. An alternative
    treatment is a mandibular advancement device or MAD. Similar to a bite guard,
    a MAD holds the lower jaw (mandible) and tongue forward, keeping the airway open.
    There are pros and cons for both. CPAP, while effective, tends to be uncomfortable,
    so it’s poorly tolerated. MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they’re
    outperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number
    of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour during sleep.

  zh: 通过面罩或鼻罩传送的持续正压通气（[CPAP](https://newatlas.com/medical/health-benefits-cpap-acid-reflux/)）常用于治疗OSA。另一种治疗方法是下颌前伸装置（MAD）。类似于咬合器，MAD将下颌和舌头向前推，保持气道开放。两者各有利弊。虽然CPAP有效，但通常不舒适，所以耐受性较差。MAD则干扰较少，但研究表明在阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停指数（AHI，即每小时完全（呼吸暂停）或部分（呼吸减少）停止呼吸的次数）方面，它们的表现不及CPAP。

    patients who cannot truly tolerate or accept using a CPAP, we should be more open-minded
