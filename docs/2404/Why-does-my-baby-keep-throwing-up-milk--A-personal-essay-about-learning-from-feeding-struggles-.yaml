    how quickly his baby was putting on weight. At 2 and a half months old, he was
    already outgrowing 6-to-9-month size clothes. He weighed almost as much as our
    13-month-old.

    of our son’s nourishment had been a source of all-consuming stress and anxiety.
    Our son had GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Prolific vomiting episodes
    that alarmed even veteran lactation consultants were a fixture of nearly every
    feeding and an ever-present threat in the time between them. He’d arch his back,
    wailing, his body going rigid with agony, and exorcize a quarter or more of a
    given meal. Every 90 to 120 minutes, we witnessed the most literal rejection of
    a mother’s milk. When we transitioned from breastfeeding to hypoallergenic formula
    (a decidedly modest improvement), I got to share equally in feeding duties, along
    with the profound sense of personal failure in this core parental competency.
    If the concept of “A-plus milk” implied the existence of “F milk,” this was what
    F milk felt like.

    to a positive outcome, as well as a worthy desire to acknowledge the energy and
    time-intensive labor of breastfeeding. But the concept of “A-plus milk” was both
    vexing and perplexing. It framed a baby’s burgeoning not as an instance of good
    fortune, but as a product of parental merit: something accomplished with talent
    and effort, something deserved. What did this imply for our family?'

    as a new father that collectively hinted at something important about American
    parenting. A couple of people joked, after conceiving quickly, about how fertile
    they and their partners must be. I witnessed gushing admiration of a new mother
    bringing a newborn to a large and unimportant gathering five days after the brutal
    act of birth (when many are still largely, or literally, bedridden), and social
    media posts celebrating pregnant women for undertaking adventurous feats like
    heli-skiing. A friend relayed the story of a couple whose final prenatal travel
    was to a remote Arctic island, where they were informed of the possibility of
    being attacked by polar bears.

    influence and merit. Others obscured good fortune while elevating narratives of
    bold triumph over one’s circumstances (even though the former was a prerequisite

    control that seemed rather incongruous with the reality of becoming a parent.

- en: For most people, becoming a parent (or merely trying to become one) represents
    a headlong leap into an existence of radically diminished control over high-stakes
    outcomes. To successfully welcome a child into a family, whether by adoption,
    surrogacy, IVF, or paleo-style conception, relies on the cooperation of many factors
    that lie beyond our control. Getting pregnant is not as easy as pulling an all-nighter
    to finish a presentation, carrying a healthy pregnancy to term is not like training
    for a half-marathon, and having a healthy newborn is not like acing an exam, although
    our expectations of agency may be anchored to such prior experiences with goal
    achievement.

    external factors, especially in life chapters when so much is out of our hands?
    I nominate Western individualism, the myth of the American dream, the platitudes

    the ability—and thus, the responsibility—to solve our problems, overcome our obstacles,
    and manifest our own success. This perspective shapes the stories we tell ourselves
    and each other about what happens in our lives—even those of us whose politics
    acknowledge its flaws. I know plenty of goal-oriented high achievers who desire
    systemic solutions to systemic social problems but who conduct their personal
    and professional lives in a way that preserves a large role for self-efficacy
    and personal responsibility—in part because life has confirmed the narrative that
    with talent, effort, willpower, and various advantages, they can achieve their
    goals. The logic of individualism and meritocracy is so ubiquitous that it has
    seeped into all of our mental groundwater.

- en: While cultural forces may prime us to give ourselves too much credit for what
    happens in life, there is a psychological basis for this. Social psychologists
    have articulated attribution biases like the fundamental attribution error (overestimating
    the responsibility of an individual relative to environmental/situational factors),
    the just-world hypothesis (people deserve what happens to them; it’s not a far
    leap from this bias to meritocratic beliefs), and the illusion of control (people
    can be led to adopt a belief in their ability to influence outcomes in games of
    chance).

    researchers consider adaptive. In one study, [subjects were exposed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022103171900709)
    to loud, random buzzing noises while performing a task. One group had no perceived
    control over the noises. The other was instructed that they *could* press a button
    to indicate they wanted the noise to stop, although they were asked not to press
    it. The second group was less stressed and performed better on the task—even though
    no one actually pressed the button.

    (and possibly biological) desire for choice and control. “When attempts to control
    events are unsuccessful, healthy individuals tend to rationalize outcomes rather
    than admit any compromise of personal control.” They suggest this may insulate
    us from “maladaptive cognitive and affective responses,” like learned helplessness.

    good thing, Jenni and I managed to find its dark side as we sought any lever we
    could pull to reduce our son’s suffering and help him retain as many calories
    as possible. With the input of various health care professionals, we were soon
    awash in such levers—at least on paper. We held him vertically for 20 or 30 minutes
    after every feeding to facilitate gravity-enhanced digestion. We tried a regimen
    of exercises to improve his oral motor skills. (The lactation consultants emphasized
    feeding mechanics: Weak oral motor skills, they said, begot swallowing excess
    air during feeding, which triggered reflux.) Hoping to continue breastfeeding,
    Jenni tried an elimination diet of common allergens (including wheat, dairy, soy,
    corn, and egg) to identify anything that might be exacerbating our son’s GERD.
    The diet succeeded only in making Jenni miserable and revealing the omnipresence
    of corn. We switched to hypoallergenic formula, one of the only interventions
    with a discernible impact. We tried different bottle shapes and sizes, and nipples
    with different flow rates. There were too many levers, too many variables that
    *might* make a difference. Our sense of responsibility far exceeded the demonstrable
    influence of our interventions. Illusion of control, indeed.'

    reflux episode, and what we could do differently next time. Was it his feeding
    position? Did we let him eat too much? Too quickly? Maybe we should have paced
    his feeding more. Maybe we should have burped him sooner. Maybe we shouldn’t have
    stopped to burp him because it made him cry, and crying made him more likely to
    throw up. Maybe we should have held him vertically for 30 minutes after eating
    instead of 20, even though it was 3:30 a.m. When things went poorly, which they
    often did, that swollen responsibility curdled into failure and self-blame.

    on self-blame that linked prolonged grief and depression symptoms with upward
    counterfactual thinking (e.g., “If only X were true, Y outcome would have turned
    out better”). While this work focused on people who’d suffered severe trauma and
    grief—far from my situation, to be clear—upward counterfactual thinking was plenty
    familiar. It was nice to have a name for the thing I’d done so often.

    misplaced pride is not totally cordoned off from another’s misplaced self-blame:

    control, accomplishment, and merit in response to our own good luck can also reinforce

    partially on factors beyond our bubble of agency. And when their influence is
    in our favor, the soundest response is not meritorious pride but humble gratitude.
