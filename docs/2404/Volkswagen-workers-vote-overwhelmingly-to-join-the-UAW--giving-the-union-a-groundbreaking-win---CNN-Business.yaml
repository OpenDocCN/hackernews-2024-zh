    body that oversees such votes, announced that 73% of the 3,600 workers at the
    plant who cast ballots had voted in favor of joining the union. There was an 84%

    \ today, roughly the same number as at the American plants of the three unionized\

    Southern states, which have a much lower level of union representation among workers
    than in Northern industrial states. Most of the nonunion auto plants are spread

    with an organizing effort, Volkswagen had remained neutral in this campaign. Its
    statement once the vote was announced was similarly even-handed, stating only
    the vote results and that “We will await certification of the results by the NLRB.
    Volkswagen thanks its Chattanooga workers for voting in this election.”

    file objections to the vote, according to the NLRB. The agency said the company
    is expected to begin bargaining in good faith with the union at that time.

    is the strength of unions in its home country of Germany. The main union for its

    by the UAW, in Pennsylvania. But that plant closed in 1988 in the face of weak
    American sales by Volkswagen. And the UAW has had little success winning the right
    to represent nonunion auto workers since then, until Friday’s vote.
