    so much money, but I couldn’t properly articulate why,” writes the Dutch philosopher
    Ingrid Robeyns. “After a decade of analyzing and debating extreme wealth, I became
    convinced that we must create a world in which no one is super-rich—that there
    must be a cap on the amount of wealth any one person can have. I call this *limitarianism*.”
    In her book of the same name, Robeyns fleshes out the case for such a cap while
    upending common conceptions of agency, ownership, and what a fortune *really*
    signifies.

  zh: 罗贝恩斯提出了个人财富的两个上限。她认为，大多数拥有稳固社会保障网的国家应该将1000万欧元（约合1080万美元）的上限纳入其社会和财政体系中。作为伦理指南，个人应该将自己限制在100万（在不那么安全的美国可能是500万美元，在那里，一张不及时的医院账单就足以使一个家庭破产）。她也感慨地指出，这两个提议的数字也比一些哲学家理想中的更不严格：例如，在《法律》中，柏拉图认为最富有的人不应该比最贫穷的人拥有的财产多四倍。
- en: The numbers are somewhat arbitrary and context-dependent, but precise amounts
    are less important than having a socially recognized upper limit in play—a line
    between being reasonably wealthy and being unethically super-rich. After a certain
    point, extra money brings decreasing marginal utility for an individual—instead,
    Robeyns suggests, those surplus funds should be used to address society’s most
    urgent and unmet needs, “redistributed to those who have very little or else used
    to fund public goods that benefit us all.”

    were, a cap on potential wealth would be demotivating, stifling innovation. Plus,
    the idea that others might have a say in distributing what an individual has personally
    earned (even though, as Robeyns convincingly illustrates, no one “earns” anything
    in a vacuum) can feel like a threatening prospect. Can governments use the money
