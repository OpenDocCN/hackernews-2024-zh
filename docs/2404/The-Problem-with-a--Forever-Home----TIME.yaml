    Home*. The idea is that this is the home you’ll raise your children in, one that’s
    either perfect or that you will spend a lot of money on to make perfect, one that
    will fulfill all your hopes and dreams. It is the opposite of a “starter home,”

    being sold and prices still declining. The term “forever home” may have gained
    popularity among real-estate agents as a way to convince people that the resale
    value of a house didn’t necessarily matter, says Matthew Lasner, a historian of
    the built environment who is a professor at Hunter College. “I think it is about
    convincing people that at a time of low underwater prices, crazy high prices,

    is because they saw it as a good investment. You could get a government-backed
    mortgage, favorable tax treatment, and sit back as your house grew in value. Homeownership,
    the saying goes, is the best way to create generational wealth in America. But
    that wasn’t the case in the years between 2007 and 2011, when prices actually

    made sense in 2010\. There was no way to know where the market was going, and
    there were other factors that were more important than resale value at the time,

    from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Still, Brown says, her clients
    are hesitant to plan to live in a house for only 3 to 5 years and then sell it
    and move on—perhaps because anyone who waited to buy a house until after 2020
    has learned just how high prices or interest rates can suddenly go, pricing them

    American homeowner had lived in their house for 11.9 years, up from 6.5 years
    in December 2005, according to data crunched by the home-listings site Redfin.
    This is partly because nearly two-thirds of Americans have a sub-4% mortgage rate
    and don’t want to lose it. But even before rates plummeted to historic lows, Americans
    had been moving less than they used to. From 1945 to 1990, roughly 15% to 20%
    of Americans moved every year. That share has been steadily declining every year

- en: Real estate didn’t used to be so visual. It wasn’t until the Great Recession
    that agents began to frequently “stage” houses to sell them, replacing the owners’
    belongings and decorations with stuff that can help potential sellers envision
    themselves living there, Lasner says. “If your parents bought a house in the 1980s,
    they didn’t pull up a set of photos. Their real estate agent probably said, ‘here’s
    a house in a neighborhood,’ and they went to the open house but certainly no one
    was changing furniture or removing travel mementos,” Lasner says.  My own parents
    tell me of running around to different towns and neighborhoods whenever a house
    in their price range was listed; often someone would have gotten there before
    them and already written a check to secure the place. The home they ended up with
    only had one bathroom; my grandparents told them they’d never ever get back what

    我的父母告诉我，每当他们的价位范围内有房子挂牌时，他们就会到不同的城镇和社区跑，通常有人在他们之前赶到并已经写了支票来确保房子。他们最终买下的房子只有一个浴室；我的祖父母告诉他们，他们永远也拿不回他们投入的成本。（现在它的价值大约是他们买入时的17倍。）

    horrible, and when we calculated just how much money we’d save by not writing
