- en: Tesla is recalling all 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has shipped to date, due to
    a problem where the accelerator pedal can get stuck, putting drivers at risk of
    a crash, [according](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls)
    to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

    10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost [two of its highest-ranking executives](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/tesla-layoffs-workers-sales-cybertruck-cuts/).
    A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to [re-vote](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/tesla-x-advertising-musk-stock-package-delware-texas/)
    on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge
    earlier this year.

    was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware
    of any crashes or injuries related to the problem.

    possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell.

- en: Tesla said it first received a notice of one of these accelerator pedal incidents
    from a customer on March 31, and then a second one on April 3\. After performing
    a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining
    that “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component
    assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant
    reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.”

    It also told NHTSA that it has started building Cybertrucks with a new accelerator
    pedal, and that it’s fixing the vehicles that are in transit or sitting at delivery
    centers.

    the vehicle’s first recall. But the initial one was minor: Earlier this year,
    Tesla recalled the software on all of its vehicles because the font sizes of its
    warning lights [were too small](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/recalls/2024/02/02/tesla-recall-font-size-warning-lights/72447967007/).
