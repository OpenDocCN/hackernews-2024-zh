    Gallup analysis of the 2022 SCF also finds that median household income is approximately
    twice as high for owner-employers as non-employer owners. As for wealth, SCF data

    relative to non-employer owners, which is close to the 4.1-to-1 ratio seen in

- en: Entrepreneurship is a narrow pathway to wealth. Being a business owner with
    no employees is not associated with significantly higher income, wealth, job satisfaction
    or life evaluation. The entrepreneurial pathway to wealth and wellbeing often
    requires that a business be large or profitable enough to be able to employ others.
    However, just 2% of all working adults and 9% of business owners currently employ
    others. In 2021, 5.4 million business applications were filed with the Internal
    Revenue Service;³ of those, only 476,000 (9%) employed workers when they launched.⁴

- en: The associations discussed in this report are consistent with the idea that
    owning a business that employs others promotes higher subjective wellbeing, income
    and wealth, but other explanations are possible. Many entrepreneurs launch a business
    using their personal savings, so higher wealth could lead to ownership, even if
    ownership does not reliably increase wealth. Yet, the higher incomes generated
    by owner-employers both in the Gallup and SCF data suggest that being an owner-employer
    does, in fact, generate more wealth.

    outcomes.
