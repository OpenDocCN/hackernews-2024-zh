    comprise an estimated 2.4% of all working adults in the U.S. Yet, other forms
    of business ownership are somewhat common. In addition to owner-employers, 15.3%
    of the workforce earns some money from self-employment but primarily works for
    an employer. Another 11.3% are mostly self-employed, and 6.9% are non-employer
    owners, meaning they are not independent contractors but business owners who do
    not have employees. Just under two-thirds of workers (64.2%) work entirely for
    others.

    do what they do best, are respected at work, get to be creative and get along
    with colleagues. There is also a large gap in overall job evaluation: 78.1% of

    owner-employers in these data are consistent with the U.S. government’s leading
    source for the analysis of wealth -- the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). A
    Gallup analysis of the 2022 SCF also finds that median household income is approximately
    twice as high for owner-employers as non-employer owners. As for wealth, SCF data
    show that median net worth is approximately 4.6 times higher for owner-employers
    relative to non-employer owners, which is close to the 4.1-to-1 ratio seen in
    the Gallup data.²

- en: Entrepreneurship is a narrow pathway to wealth. Being a business owner with
    no employees is not associated with significantly higher income, wealth, job satisfaction
    or life evaluation. The entrepreneurial pathway to wealth and wellbeing often
    requires that a business be large or profitable enough to be able to employ others.
    However, just 2% of all working adults and 9% of business owners currently employ
    others. In 2021, 5.4 million business applications were filed with the Internal
    Revenue Service;³ of those, only 476,000 (9%) employed workers when they launched.⁴

- en: The associations discussed in this report are consistent with the idea that
    owning a business that employs others promotes higher subjective wellbeing, income
    and wealth, but other explanations are possible. Many entrepreneurs launch a business
    using their personal savings, so higher wealth could lead to ownership, even if
    ownership does not reliably increase wealth. Yet, the higher incomes generated
    by owner-employers both in the Gallup and SCF data suggest that being an owner-employer
    does, in fact, generate more wealth.

    predict both higher subjective wellbeing and business ownership. Gallup will seek
    to conduct longitudinal research on the subjective wellbeing of working adults
    to better evaluate how baseline ownership predicts changes in financial and wellbeing-related
    outcomes.
