- en: 'The overnight chill continued into a recent morning in Longmeadow, Massachusetts,
    when sheriff’s deputies arrived at 49 Memery Lane. It would have been a perfect
    fall day but for the unpleasant business at hand: the eviction of Alton King Jr.,
    a 79-year-old retiree who had lived at the address for decades. He’d spent the
    past few years fighting foreclosure, and in a last-ditch effort to save his sprawling
    home, he was at the courthouse that morning to ask a judge for a stay. The battle
    had garnered the attention of local activists devoted to fighting unlawful foreclosures,
    and a handful of them were outside at his house to protest. The deputies were
    waiting for King to return when a blue SUV with a landscaping trailer peeled into
    the driveway.'

    trailer, which carried a half-dozen wooden boxes. With a pair of reading glasses
    draped around the collar of her purple fleece, she began to shake the boxes, because
    with the temperature in the low 50s, it was too cold for the honeybees inside
    to fly without a little coaxing. A deputy, realizing what she was about to unleash,
    tried to stop her, but a bee stung him in the face, forcing him to retreat. The
    maneuver bought Woods enough time to pull on a beekeeper suit with a vented hood
    that covered her face and roll one of the hives off the trailer and up to the
    entryway of King’s house. Three more officers marched forward to stop her, but
    they too were stung by the cloud of bees and fell back. Nearly 30 minutes later,
    one officer managed to handcuff her as the protesters cheered. “We’re with you,
    Rorie!” one yelled. She called back to another, telling her to take care of Zekie,
    her Chihuahua-basenji mix that had been sitting in her vehicle as the chaos unfolded.
    As the officer led Woods to a cruiser, he told her that he and several officers
    were allergic to bees. “Oh you’re allergic, good,” she allegedly replied.

    of a dangerous weapon (bees),” three counts of assault by means of a dangerous
    weapon (also bees), and disorderly conduct, she was heralded as a folk hero. “This
    is not about a few sheriffs getting a few honeybee stings,” she said in an interview.
    “It’s about predatory lending, which is thriving in Massachusetts and beyond.”

- en: 'Generally, there are three markets for mortgages: prime, subprime, and predatory.
    Lenders in the predatory market have historically targeted vulnerable borrowers,
    offering loans with unfair or burdensome terms that can set victims down the road
    to financial hardship. In 2005, Woods was working as a home-remodeling contractor,
    and amid the housing boom fueled by easy lending, she took out a mortgage for
    a four-bedroom Colonial across from the Hadley Town Commons in Western Massachusetts.
    Soon after, she mortgaged another home, a rental property down the street. The
    following year, she was injured on a job, fell behind on both of her mortgage
    payments, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in order to avoid foreclosure. Woods
    claims that one of her mortgages was a subprime mortgage dressed up to look like
    a prime mortgage that was designed to lead to foreclosure. Her other mortgage,
    she says, was discriminatory because it referred to her as “a single woman.” She’s
    never filed a lawsuit challenging the loans, only calling them predatory as part
    of her defense in foreclosure proceedings.'

    and contracting jobs had dried up, so Woods made a full-time job out of her old
    hobby: beekeeping. Inspired by the work of Charles Mraz, a Vermont honeybee farmer
    who was the leading voice for the therapeutic use of bee stings to treat autoimmune
    diseases, she had begun keeping bees in the early 1990s, hoping that she could
    one day use them to treat all sorts of ailments. She kept a few hives but considered
    it a hobby, never really using them for therapeutic purposes. During the Great
    Recession, she increased her hive production and found that the gift economy among
    farmers in the Pioneer Valley was bountiful. She’d exchange honey for sausages,
    thick-cut bacon, or cases of blueberries. “It wasn’t terribly lucrative, but it
    did afford me an excellent quality of life,” she said. “That quality of life has
    been destroyed by this wrongful predatory loan, wrongful foreclosure, the wrongful
    evictions.”'

- en: Over the next decade, Woodsmanaged to stall the foreclosures of her properties
    by filing appeals, challenging the validity of her mortgages, and once again filing
    for bankruptcy. But in early 2018, Goldman Sachs foreclosed on Woods’s rental
    property and, five months later, Wells Fargo foreclosed on her Colonial, which
    a couple bought at auction. Although she fought both foreclosures, that July,
    sheriff’s deputies forced her out. She would remain homeless for years, sometimes
    living in a tent. Though most of her beehives weren’t on the property, Woods sought
    damages related to her bees, claiming the havoc the eviction wrought on her life
    precipitated the collapse of many of her hives. Throughout the process, Woods,
    who has a degree in documentary filmmaking from Hampshire College, steeped herself
    in property law. By her own tally, she’s been involved in 46 cases to date, and
    she’s represented herself in many of those cases, including an appeal to the Supreme
    Court. Discussing the cases, she speaks in unbroken paragraphs, calling on case
    law, mentioning relevant rulings or judges’ names without missing a beat. Once,
    after Woods made a long, deeply researched argument in front of a judge, even
    the opposing counsel, an attorney for a moving company that handled her belongings
    during her eviction, seemed impressed. “Your honor, as you just heard, she is
    highly intelligent,” he said.

    Lending, a statewide coalition of organizations assisting people who have faced
    foreclosure. That’s where she met King, who was fighting to keep the 9,563-square-foot
    home he built in 2002\. In 2006, King, a financial adviser and entrepreneur, received
    a construction loan to add an indoor basketball court to the house. According
    to King, that loan came with a negative amortization rate that he was unaware
    of until he saw his mortgage payments go from $3,200 to $13,400 over the next
    few years. “I got sucked into one of the worst predatory loans anybody has ever
    heard of,” he said, believing he was given the loan because he is Black. Like
    Woods, King, once he realized he might be evicted, looked to MAAPL for support.
    He joined weekly phone calls with as many as 20 people to exchange information
    and ideas about their cases. “We started to realize in our loose organization
    of people who are the wrongfully foreclosed, ‘Oh, we all were set up!’” Woods
    said. “We like to show up for each other in court and to show moral support. We
    often will read each other’s filings just as a second set of eyes to make sure
    that we haven’t misargued something or stated something twice.”

    The Hampden County Sheriff’s Department had spent the past year evicting people
    at a rate of two or three per day, according to a recent [New York *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/us/evictions-pandemic.html)
    profile of Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi that focused on his efforts to make the process
    of eviction easier on people during the pandemic. After refusing a notice by deputies
    to vacate, King received a second notice to leave within 48 hours. Woods accompanied
    him to look at the facility where his belongings would be taken. The morning of
    his eviction, he went to the courthouse to appeal for a last-minute stay. He was
    unsuccessful, and, to his surprise, when he returned to 49 Memery Lane, a sheriff’s
    deputy told him that Woods had been arrested for the bee attack.

    co-founder of MAAPL, seemed to tell another story: Woods was always moving her
    bees around after she was evicted, and “Al had said, ‘Bring them to my house.’
    But she certainly shouldn’t have tried to unload them while there were sheriffs
    at his house,” Ross said, chuckling, before claiming she had video footage that
    contradicted sheriff’s deputies’ accounts of the morning.'

    Division have I seen something like this,” said Robert Hoffman of the sheriff’s
    department in a press release. “I’m just thankful no one died because bee allergies
    are serious. I hope that these out-of-county protesters will reconsider using
    extreme measures in the future because they will be charged and prosecuted.”

    King’s home. She did, however, assure me that very few people experience anaphylaxis
    from honeybee venom: One study suggested anywhere from 0.3 percent to 8.9 percent
    of the population. “Those of us in this fight have been cast as deadbeats, and
    we are anything but,” she said. “I’ve been cast as litigious and frivolous because
    of the number of cases, and, in fact, I think that’s just my opponents’ frustrating
    way of trying to say ‘Why hasn’t she died yet?’”'
