    Backpage co-founder Michael Lacey of dozens of counts, including a majority of
    those on which federal prosecutors planned to retry Lacey later this year. U.S.
    District Judge Diane Humetewa also acquitted former Backpage executives Jed Brunst
    and Scott Spear on multiple counts of which they were convicted by a jury last
    fall.

    Court finds there is insufficient of evidence to support convictions under Counts
    19–51 as to Mr. Lacey and Counts 66–99 as to Messrs. Lacey, Brunst, and Spear,"
    concluded Humetewa.'

    of just one the 86 counts against him and not guilty of one count as well. The
    jury was hung on the other 84 counts, including all charges that Lacey actively
    facilitated prostitution or participated in a conspiracy to facilitate prostitution
    via the online classifieds site he founded with his longtime newspaper partner
    James Larkin. (Larkin [took his own life last summer](https://reason.com/2023/08/02/backpage-publisher-alt-weekly-entrepreneur-and-free-speech-warrior-james-larkin-has-died/)
    a few days before the trial was scheduled to begin.)

    Additionally, Humetewa acquitted Spear, former executive vice president of Backpage,
    of 10 of the counts on which he was found guilty by the jury and acquitted former
    Chief Financial Officer Brunst of 18 of the counts on which he was convicted.

    against him, which include one count of conspiracy to violate the federal Travel
    Act by facilitating prostitution, 17 counts of violating the Travel Act by facilitating
    prostitution, and several different money laundering counts.

    concealment of money laundering—on which the jury found him guilty. It comes with
    a possible sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. Lacey plans to appeal
    his conviction on this count, and there seems like a good chance it will be successful,
    since the money he allegedly "concealed" was reported to the federal government
    with all the proper paperwork. But he could still face prison time as that appeals
    process plays out.

  zh: 而在6月17日，Lacey将因为陪审团认定他有罪的一项指控——国际洗钱隐瞒罪——而被判刑。这可能导致他在联邦监狱里被判最长20年的刑期。Lacey计划就这一项定罪上诉，看起来他成功的机会很大，因为他所谓的“隐瞒”的钱款已经按照所有规定向联邦政府报告。但在上诉过程中，他仍可能面临监禁。
- en: Brunst is scheduled to be sentenced along with Lacey in June and even with Humetewa's
    acquittals, he still faces sentencing on 14 counts. And Spear, who is scheduled
    to be sentenced on July 9, still faces sentencing on 29 counts.
