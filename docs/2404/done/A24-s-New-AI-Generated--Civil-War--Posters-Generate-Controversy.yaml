  zh: 有一个问题。嗯，或许不止一个。或者一个也没有，这取决于你的观点。我们来解释一下。
- en: The five images (below) tease postapocalyptic scenes in major United States
    cities that have been torn apart by conflict. The Sphere is blackened wreck amid
    a smoldering Las Vegas. There is a floating gun unit in a lake outside Los Angeles.
    There are troops on patrol in San Francisco. A Miami street lays in ruins. There
    are tour boats full of refugees on the Chicago River. All scenes suggesting war-torn
    destruction in iconic locations.

  zh: 下面的五幅图片展示了美国主要城市的后启示录场景，这些城市被冲突撕裂。在冒着烟的拉斯维加斯中间有一个被烧焦的球体。洛杉矶外的一个湖中漂浮着一个枪械单元。旧金山有巡逻部队。迈阿密的街道成为废墟。芝加哥河上有满载难民的旅游船。所有这些场景都暗示了标志性地点的战乱破坏。
- en: '*Except* … none of these scenes are actually in the movie. They’ve caused some
    to wonder if the campaign is giving potential moviegoers a false expectation of
    what they’ll see in the film. *[Civil War](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/civil-war/)*
    is A24’s most expensive production to date, costing around $50 million. Yet the
    images make the film look like a movie with twice that budget.'

  zh: '*除了*… 实际上电影中并没有这些场景。这些海报让一些人怀疑这种宣传活动是否给潜在的观众造成了对电影看法的错误期待。*[内战](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/civil-war/)*是A24迄今为止最昂贵的制作，成本约为5000万美元。然而这些图片让电影看起来像是预算翻倍的电影。'
- en: “None of this happens in the movie,” wrote one reader on [A24’s Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C53sqodLqeT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D).
    “I don’t understand this campaign. U are selling a movie that doesn’t exist and
    it’s very bizarre. I love a24 with all my heart but i am so bloody confused about
    what happened with this film.”

  zh: “在电影中完全没有这种情况发生，”一个读者在[A24的Instagram帖子](https://www.instagram.com/p/C53sqodLqeT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D)上写道。“我不理解这个宣传活动。你们在销售一部根本不存在的电影，这非常奇怪。我全心全意地喜欢A24，但我对这部电影到底发生了什么感到非常困惑。”
- en: The other potential issue is the images are artificial intelligence-generated,
    resulting in some backlash over the use of the technology. The AI work also resulted
    in some notable geographic and landmark mistakes and a bit of “uncanny valley”
    weirdness. For instance, the two Marina Towers buildings in Chicago are on the
    same side of the river in reality but are on opposite sides in the art. Meanwhile,
    a shot of wreckage in Miami shows a car with three doors. Some believe the giant
    swan in a Los Angeles lake is likewise an AI fail, but that’s probably meant to
    be a paddleboat — though it doesn’t really look like a paddleboat, either.

  zh: 另一个潜在问题是图像由人工智能生成，因此引发了一些对技术使用的强烈反响。AI工作还导致了一些显著的地理和地标错误，以及一些“怪异的不真实感”。例如，芝加哥的两座玛丽娜塔楼实际上在同一条河的同一侧，但在艺术作品中却位于对面。同时，迈阿密一处残骸的镜头显示了一辆有三扇门的汽车。有人认为洛杉矶湖中的巨型天鹅也是AI的失败案例，但那可能是一艘桨板船——尽管它看起来并不像一艘桨板船。
- en: '“You know DAMN well how the film community feels about the use of AI Generated
    content,” wrote one reader. “And the backlash [to AI generated stills featured
    in the horror film] *Late Night With The Devil* was more than enough to make that
    transparently clear to everyone: WE DO NOT WANT THIS. How stupid of your marketing
    team to even think this was acceptable. We are trying our hardest to fight against
    the push of opening Pandora’s Box with this shit and here you are willfully ignoring
    everyone’s concerns in that matter.”'

  zh: 一位读者写道：“你们非常清楚电影界对使用AI生成内容的感受。”“而《与魔鬼共舞的深夜》中使用AI生成的静态图像引发的强烈反响已经足以明确告诉每个人：我们不想要这个。你们的营销团队认为这是可以接受的真是愚蠢至极。我们正在尽最大努力抵制这种破坏，而你们却故意无视每个人对此事的担忧，真是愚不可及。”
- en: The ads were posted on Instagram and used as physical posters in a couple of
    locations. A source close to the movie said the images help imagine the nationwide
    impact of the film’s fictional war. “These are AI images inspired by the movie,”
    a source said. “The entire movie is a big ‘what if’ and so we wanted to continue
    that thought on social — powerful imagery of iconic landmarks with that dystopian
    realism.”

  zh: 这些广告在Instagram上发布，并在几个地点用作实体海报。一位接近电影的消息来源表示，这些图像帮助想象了电影虚构战争的全国影响力。“这些都是受电影启发的AI图像，”一位消息来源说。“整部电影都是一个大的‘假设’，因此我们希望在社交媒体上继续这种思考——以那些具有末世现实主义的标志性地标的强大形象。”
- en: The recent *Late Night With the Devil* controversy seems like the closest comparison,
    if a rather imperfect one. The IFC Films/Shudder release used AI to help create
    some title cards for the 1970s-era late night talk show that’s in the film. The
    usage received strong backlash on social media. The film’s directors Cameron and
    Colin Cairnes [defended the usage](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/late-night-with-the-devil-ai-backlash-explained-1234966938/),
    saying, “In conjunction with our amazing graphics and production design team,
    all of whom worked tirelessly to give this film the ’70s aesthetic we had always
    imagined, we experimented with AI for three still images which we edited further
    and ultimately appear as very brief interstitials in the film.”

  zh: 最近的*与魔鬼一起深夜*争议似乎是最接近的比较，尽管有些不完美。IFC Films/Shudder 发布的这部影片利用人工智能制作了一些1970年代深夜脱口秀节目的片头字幕。这种使用在社交媒体上引起了强烈反响。影片的导演Cameron和Colin
    Cairnes [为这种使用辩护](https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/late-night-with-the-devil-ai-backlash-explained-1234966938/)，称：“在我们出色的图形和制作设计团队的协助下，他们不辞辛苦地为我们设想中的‘70年代风格’影片进行了AI实验，这些实验最终以极为简短的插图出现在影片中。”
- en: In any case, the marketing effort is certainly causing some online buzz as *Civil
    War* heads into its second weekend. The film from writer-director Alex Garland [opened](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/civil-war-box-office-opening-1235873625/) to
    a notably better-than-expected $25.7 million, a record for the studio. After all
    the discussion of the film’s politics, or lack thereof, it also drew an [equal
    number of moviegoers](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/civil-war-red-states-and-blue-states-1235875216/)
    that self-identified as liberal and conservative according to exit polling.

  zh: 无论如何，随着*内战*进入第二个周末，这种营销策略无疑引起了一些网络关注。来自编剧兼导演Alex Garland的这部影片 [开启了](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/civil-war-box-office-opening-1235873625/)
    意料之外的好成绩，首周末票房达到了令人瞩目的2570万美元，创下了该制片厂的记录。在讨论影片的政治内容或其缺失后，根据退出投票，同样数量的电影观众自称是自由派和保守派。
- en: Ironically enough, before *Civil War*, Garland was perhaps best known for his
    2014 directorial debut, *Ex Machina*, a film that warned about the dangers of
    AI.
