    Every computing technology that touches our lives is made possible by algorithms.
    Understanding the principles that make for powerful and efficient algorithms deepens
    our understanding not only of computer science, but also the laws of nature. While
    theoretical computer science is known as a field that presents exciting intellectual
    challenges and is often not directly concerned with improving the practical applications
    of computing, research breakthroughs in this discipline have led to advances in
    almost every area of the field—from cryptography and computational biology to

  zh: 为什么随机性很重要？
- en: Fundamentally, computers are *deterministic* systems; the set of instructions
    of an algorithm applied to any given input uniquely determines its computation
    and, in particular, its output. In other words, the deterministic algorithm is
    following a predictable pattern. *Randomness* , by contrast, lacks a well-defined
    pattern, or predictability in events or outcomes. Because the world we live in
    seems full of random events (weather systems, biological and quantum phenomena,
    etc.), computer scientists have enriched algorithms by allowing them to make random
    choices in the course of their computation, in the hope of improving their efficiency.
    And indeed, many problems for which no efficient deterministic algorithm was known
    have been solved efficiently by probabilistic algorithms, albeit with some small
    probability of error (that can be efficiently reduced). But is randomness essential,
    or can it be removed? And what is the quality of randomness needed for the success
    of probabilistic algorithms?

  zh: 计算机基本上是*确定性*系统；对于任何给定的输入，算法的一组指令唯一地确定了其计算过程，特别是其输出。换句话说，确定性算法遵循可预测的模式。*随机性*，相反，缺乏明确定义的模式或事件或结果的可预测性。因为我们生活的世界似乎充满了随机事件（天气系统、生物和量子现象等），计算机科学家通过允许算法在计算过程中进行随机选择来丰富算法，希望提高其效率。事实上，许多在没有有效确定性算法的情况下解决的问题，通过概率算法得到了有效解决，尽管存在一定的错误概率（可以有效地减少）。但随机性是否是必要的？它可以被消除吗？概率算法的成功需要什么样的随机性质量？
- en: These, and many other fundamental questions lie at the heart of understanding
    randomness and pseudorandomness in computation. An improved understanding of the
    dynamics of randomness in computation can lead us to develop better algorithms

    and computational difficulty (i.e., identifying natural problems that have no
    efficient algorithms). Working with colleagues, Wigderson authored a highly influential
    series of works on trading hardness for randomness. They proved that, under standard
    and widely believed computational assumptions, every probabilistic polynomial
    time algorithm can be efficiently derandomized (namely, made fully deterministic).
    In other words, randomness is not necessary for efficient computation. This sequence
    of works revolutionized our understanding of the role of randomness in computation,
    and the way we think about randomness. This series of influential papers include
    the following three:'
