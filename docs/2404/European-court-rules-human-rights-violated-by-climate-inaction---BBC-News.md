# European court rules human rights violated by climate inaction - BBC News

Asked about her commitment to the case, she said: "Some of us are just made that way. We are not made to sit in a rocking chair and knit."

"We know statistically that in 10 years we will be gone. So whatever we do now, we are not doing for ourselves, but for the sake of our children and our children's children," she added.

Youth activists around the world had hoped that the six Portuguese young people would also win their case against 32 European governments.

The youth, aged from 12-24, had argued that increasingly extreme heatwaves and wildfires left them unable to go outside to play, to go to school, and that they suffered from climate anxiety.

But the court said the case needed to be decided in Portugal first.

Sofia Oliveira, 19, told BBC News that she was disappointed but that the Swiss women's win 'is a win for us too and a win for everyone'."

A third case by a former French mayor claimed that inaction by the French government risked his town being submerged in the North Sea.

It was dismissed because he no longer lived in France and claimants must prove that they are direct victims of human rights violations.

Decisions made in the European Court of Human Rights influence law across its 46 member states.

Estelle Dehon KC, a barrister at Cornerstone Barristers in the UK, said "the judgement deals with difficult issues that also vex the UK courts in a way that may be persuasive."

"It comprehensively dismisses the argument that courts cannot rule on climate legal obligations because climate change is a global phenomenon or because action by one state is just a 'drop in the ocean'," she told BBC News.

Governments globally have signed up to drastically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

But scientists and activists say that progress is too slow and the world is not on track to meet the crucial target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C.

Switzerland's largest party, the right-wing Swiss People's Party, condemned the ruling, [calling it a scandal, external](https://twitter.com/UDCch/status/1777707449501310985) and threatening to leave the Council of Europe.

That is unlikely to happen because they hold just two seats of seven in government.

The Socialist Party welcomed the court's decision and said the government should implement it as soon as possible, according to Swiss broadcaster RTS.
