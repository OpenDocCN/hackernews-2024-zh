    modern timeline. This unusual, and unusually beautiful, pedagogical tool, which
    was published by Priestley in 1765, while he was in his thirties and working as
    a tutor at an academy in Warrington, England, tends to get lost in the shuffle
    of Priestley’s more notable achievements—his seminal 1761 textbook on language,
    *The Rudiments of English Grammar*, say, or his discovery of nine gases, including
    oxygen, 13 years later. But the chart, along with its companion, *A New Chart
    of History*, which Priestley published four years later, has become a curious
    subject of interest among data visualization aficionados who have analyzed its
    revolutionary design in academic papers and added it to Internet lists of notable
    infographics. Recently, both charts have become the focus of an NEH-supported
    digital humanities project, Chronographics: The Time Charts of Joseph Priestley,
    produced by scholars at the University of Oregon.'

    paper scroll—which contains the meticulously inscribed names of approximately
    2,000 poets, artists, statesmen, and other famous historical figures dating back
    three millennia—is visually striking, combining a formal, somewhat ornate eighteenth-century
    aesthetic with the precise organization of a schematic. Every single one of the
    chart’s subjects is grouped vertically into one of six occupational categories,
    then plotted out chronologically along a horizonal line divided into ten-year
    increments. Despite the huge quantity of information it contains, it is extremely
    user-friendly. Any one of Priestley’s history students could run his eye across
    the chart and immediately gain a sense of the temporal lay of the land. Who came
    first: Copernicus or Newton? How many centuries separate Genghis Khan from Joan
    of Arc? Which artists were working during the reign of Henry VIII? The chart was
    a masterful blend of form and function, and Priestley knew it.'

    out—was the way in which he linked units of time to units of distance on the page,
    similar to the way a cartographer uses scale when creating a map. (The artist
    Pietro Lorenzetti lived two hundred years before Titian and thus is situated twice
    as far from Titian as Jan van Eyck, who predated Titian by about a century.) 
    If this innovation is hard for contemporary viewers to fully appreciate, it’s
    probably because Priestley’s representation of time has become a convention that’s
    used everywhere in visual design and seems so obvious it’s now taken for granted.

    chart” of market seasons in Washington, and the historian David Ramsay, who acknowledged
    Priestley’s influence in his *Historical and Biographical Chart of the United

    Franklin’s 1751 book on electricity piqued his interested in the subject, Priestley
    finagled an introduction to the book’s famous author, then proceeded to research
    and publish his own 700-page tome on the subject—a “history of the discoveries
    in electricity,” complete with his own experiments for interested readers. When
    the book’s plates required an illustrator, and he was unable to find a satisfactory
    one, he taught himself perspective drawing, then published a 1770 tutorial for
    aspiring artists titled *A Familiar Introduction to the Theory and Practice of
    Perspective*. (Fun fact: Priestley is often credited with discovering the erasing

    it with carbon dioxide, he produced the 34-page illustrated pamphlet “Directions
    for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.” “To make this process more generally known,”

    water contained antiscorbutic properties, Britain’s Royal College of Physicians
    instructed Captain James Cook to test out the carbonation process on his upcoming

    had no more vitamin C in it than uncarbonated flat water, and so it was equally
    useless when it came to preventing scurvy. But it was an unconventional, and thus
    fitting, way to mark Priestley’s foray into yet another scientific discipline.

    jumped the gun, inviting Priestley to join the expedition without being authorized
    to do so.) But Priestley’s assumption was an understandable one. He was a nonconformist
    minister and a member of England’s Protestant Dissenter minority, one that opposed
    state involvement in religious issues, refused to subscribe to the Anglican church’s
    doctrine, and, as result, faced discrimination. (Dissenters like Priestley were,

    was, by that point, a seasoned veteran of the era’s pamphlet wars, having embroiled
    himself in controversy with his 1768 *A Free Address to Protestant Dissenters
    on the Subject of the Lord’s Supper* before going on, two years later, to attack
    major aspects of Calvinist doctrine in *An Appeal to the Serious and Candid Professors
    of Christianity*. Over the next two decades, his notoriety would only grow as
    he published a series of “brilliantly controversial works,” wrote the historian
    David Wykes, which “advanc[ed] ideas that caught up and convinced many of his
    readers and a generation of young ministers” but which also unleashed “a storm
    of anger.” Orthodox readers were not particularly keen to hear Priestley analyze
    the logical flaws he had discovered in the doctrine of atonement or to hear him
    out as he explained the ways in which their beliefs regarding the Holy Trinity
    were “inconsistent with reason and common sense.” In 1785, three years after it
    was published, his book *An History of the Corruptions of Christianity* was banned

- en: Far from silencing him, the barrage of angry responses goaded Priestley into
    picking up his pen and producing more pamphlets filled with more arguments. “He
    entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most
    of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously
    wrong,” Schofield wrote. “He was able, then, to contrast his sweet reasonableness

    political views—his support for the American and French revolutions, his criticism
    of the slave trade, his commitment to religious liberty for Dissenters, his agitation
    for parliamentary reform—only served to cement his reputation, first as a radical,
    and then as a dangerous menace. By 1790, his enemies had come to see the soft-spoken
    minister as “the devil incarnate,” wrote Wykes. It was a comparison that Priestley,
    perhaps unwisely, did not shy away from. “If he really took me to be that *malicious
    Being*, above described,” he wrote gleefully of one of his foes, “he should not

    with his friend John Adams and the Federalists, in danger, at one point, of being
    deported from the very country that had just offered him asylum. (Adams blamed
    Priestley’s *Letters to the Inhabitants of Northumberland* for contributing to
    his 1800 electoral defeat to Jefferson.) In his adopted homeland, Priestley returned
    to his scientific work with renewed zeal, but that, too, proved to be controversial,
    as he produced paper after paper attacking the experiments of his fellow chemists,
    who had moved on from Priestley’s outdated theory of “dephlogisticated air” to
    follow the more quantitative approach of scientists like Antoine Lavoisier. In
    doing so, Schofield observed, Priestley was “perversely fighting the new chemistry
    based on his discoveries” in a way that would come to exasperate even his admirers.
    In a eulogy written for the Académie Nationale des Sciences, the zoologist Georges
    Cuvier would famously proclaim Priestley to be “the father of modern chemistry
    [who] never acknowledged his daughter.”

  zh: 但是农业并不适合普里斯特利，宁静也不适合他。在接下来的几年里，普里斯特利发现自己再次陷入政治风波之中，这一次与他的朋友约翰·亚当斯和联邦党人发生冲突，曾一度面临被驱逐出境的危险，这个国家刚刚为他提供了庇护。
    （亚当斯归咎于普里斯特利的《给北伦敦居民的信》导致他在1800年选举中输给了杰斐逊。） 在他的收养国，普里斯特利以更新的热情回归科学工作，但这同样引发了争议，因为他一篇篇攻击其同行化学家的实验，他们已经放弃了普里斯特利过时的“脱氧空气”理论，转而采用安托万·拉瓦锡等科学家更为定量的方法。
    斯科菲尔德观察到，普里斯特利这样做是在“顽固地对抗基于他的发现的新化学”，这种做法甚至使他的崇拜者感到恼火。 在为法国国家科学院写的一篇颂词中，动物学家乔治·居维叶将著名地称普里斯特利为“现代化学之父
    [从未承认自己的女儿]”。
- en: The century-old theory Priestley relied upon during his pneumatic experiments—which
    postulated that all flammable substances contained an element called phlogiston
    that was released into the surrounding air during combustion—proved to be wrong
    in the end. But the work he conducted in the final decade of his life was not
    a wasted effort, says Schofield. By relentlessly hounding his critics, by probing
    for the weak spots in their arguments, he had “forced the tightening of their
    experimental evidence,” and compelled them to up their scientific game. Surely
    that fact would have offered him some satisfaction. He understood that the pursuit
    of knowledge was not a solitary one. Even the most famous individuals, the ones
    whose accomplishments fill the pages of books, the ones whose names adorn charts
    of history, he once wrote, “enjoy . . . the labours and discoveries of others”
    before they “go off the stage,” leaving their work behind, to be advanced by those
    who follow them.

  zh: 普里斯特利在他的气态实验中依赖的一个世纪前的理论——假设所有可燃物质都包含一种叫做焦炭的元素，在燃烧过程中释放到周围空气中——最终被证明是错误的。 但是，他在生命的最后十年进行的工作并非徒劳无功，斯科菲尔德说。
    通过不懈地追问他的批评者，通过探索他们论点的弱点，他“迫使他们加强实验证据”，并迫使他们提高科学水平。 这个事实肯定会给他一些满足感。 他明白，追求知识不是一人之功。
    即使是最著名的个人，那些成就填满了书页，那些名字装饰了历史图表的人，在他们“离开舞台”之前，也“享受……他人的劳动和发现”，留下他们的工作，由后来者来推进。
- en: Priestley labored as long as possible, through deteriorating health and advancing
    old age, continuing to conduct experiments until he was unable to leave his bed.
    On February 6, 1804, he called his assistant to his side with one final request
    for help on revisions to an unfinished manuscript that required his attention.
    He worked until he had assured himself that he had finished what was needed. “That
    is right,” he said. “I have now done.” Minutes later, he was gone.

  zh: 普里斯特利尽可能长时间地进行工作，直到健康恶化和年龄增长，继续进行实验，直到他无法离开床。 1804年2月6日，他叫来助手，最后一次请求帮助修改一份未完成的手稿。
    他工作直到确信自己完成了需要做的事情。“这是对的，”他说。“我现在完成了。” 几分钟后，他离开了人世。
