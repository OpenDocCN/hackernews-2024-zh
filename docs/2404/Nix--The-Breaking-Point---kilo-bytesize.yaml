- en: A torrent of emotions and frustration have engulfed the Nix Community, however
    one may define it. Tensions between contributors are high, tensions between non-contributors
    are high. There is no joy in such an environment. Within the last calendar year,
    problems bubbling beneath the surface have boiled over, breaching the previously
    restricted confines of individual conversations or one-off occurrences in chat
    rooms. Something needs to change, or so it would seem, unless the current dismal
    state of affairs is intended to persist. What, then, should change? Who will drive
    this change forward? And, perhaps most importantly, how can history be stopped
    from repeating itself.

- en: Nix, for the longest time, has operated organically. That is to say, rules and
    direction have only been constructed or provided once absolutely necessary. The
    growth of the project is beyond what one, two, or ten could manage on their own.
    As such, a bureaucratic body, the NixOS Foundation, was enshrined as the entity
    which would oversee legal requirements for the project as well as provide direction.
    This north star, however, was dim at best and misleading at worst. The lacking
    power, or described more bluntly, backbone, of the foundation has left it appealing
    to few. The entity is intended to provide oversight of Nix and its related projects,
    but has appeared to mostly be a vehicle for advertisement or legitimization of
    the businesses its members operate.

    is difficult and, throughout the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of packages,
    the project certainly has its share of scars. Importantly, the package repository
    sees a much larger pool of contributors and interaction than Nix itself does.
    The ad-hoc structure of maintainers here better represent the goals of Nix users
    and their methods of success. Yet, these contributors are beginning to flee.

- en: The work being done for Nix and its surrounding official projects is difficult
    to map. A series of “teams”, ranging from security to moderation exist to compartmentalize
    the many processes and fulfill the requirements of Nix projects. Paradoxically,
    these teams are hardly more empowered than any other individual contributor, only
    benefiting from more direct modes of communication and name recognition. The management
    of projects and features is still wildly ad-hoc and limited significantly by the
    volunteer nature of these contributors. Frequent re-litigation of well-discussed
    issues for one's ego, rejection of reasonable contributions in rejection of a
    healthy ecosystem, and thinly-veiled hostility is a staple of the Nix landscape
    despite many refusing to admit such.

    status as the central figure of Nix refuses to fulfill this position. Frequent
    inaction, unsatisfactory action, and a general disconnection from the entirety
    of the Nix community and ecosystem seem to be pervasive within the NixOS Foundation.
    Lacking the conviction to decide, fully, the direction of Nix for the entire ecosystem
    leaves the many corners of the community to construct their own interpretations.
    This model is not compatible with the current structure of Nix projects. Rather,
    the current boys-club of a foundation continues to stifle any natural ownership
    that contributors would develop for the many projects they provide value to.

    decisions, this current set of circumstances would not have precipitated. Yet,
    malice should not be attributed directly to these individuals, if only for naivety.
    The NixOS Foundation was not created to become a body of inaction or divisiveness,
    and, its members do not participate for want of division within the community.
    Building Nix, NixOS, and all of the related tooling is still the fundamental desire
    of everyone involved. For fear of detracting any further, it must be said that
    these people are just that: people. Treat them as such.'

    Many of the troubles of today arise from a disconnect between the foundation members
    and the many Nix teams, contributors, and users. Providing these groups with methods
    for action may allow for the avoidance of such a problem recurring.
  prefs: []

    is no single archetype which overlays cleanly upon every member. The myriad members
    express different beliefs and values, many of which are diametrically opposed.
    Many of these can be avoided or understood as unnecessary territory, but it is
    inevitable for disagreements to form and tensions with them. The actions within
    the Nix sphere have invoked such a disagreement, proving it had been put off for
    far too long. One subset of said community believes in valuing the impact their
    actions have upon others. Another subset believes willful ignorance towards the
    effects of their actions is acceptable. One cannot compromise the two views.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The solution, however, is not one of compromise, but one of direction. Fundamentally,
    the community must be provided clear direction of Nix and its projects. Either
    it will be a project of conscientious action or one of ignorance. The limbo within
    which the issue currently sits is not sustainable. Such a decision must be made
    and must be done so clearly and directly. Refusing to do so has and will continue
    to allow malicious bodies to incite more significant harm. A community devoid
    of people is no community.
  prefs: []

- en: Much of the frustration has risen from inaction by authoritative figures. Whether
    inconsiderate sponsorship, conflicts of interest, harmful conduct, or a refusal
    to collaborate, these actions have repeatedly affirmed such positions of authority
    as the effective owners of Nix with no consequence. Attempts at resolving any
    of these issues are to be deemed personal attacks with little to no validity.
    No action is capable of overruling this imbalance of power. With little to no
    recourse, the community is expected to accept every outcome.

    world seems like a hard statement to argue with. Mindful creation is no new feat,
    but clearly one that must be reiterated and practiced regularly in a cooperative
    manner. Still, there is no simple answer for Nix; rather, three outcomes appear
    possible.

    continue, if only slowed briefly. The only lesson learned will be to explicitly
    refuse any acknowledgement of non-technical Nix topics. Nix will continue on its
    journey to becoming a product.

    governance to contributors in a democratic fashion. Some will still leave, some
    will refuse to return, but cooperation will be the future of Nix. The events spoken
    of today will provide useful reference for management of contentious issues. Nix
    will be created by and for the Nix Community.

    undesirable actions as acceptable. In doing so, those who disagree will have no
    choice but to remove themselves from the now permanently hostile environment.
    Nix will retain only contributors accepting of these actions. All other contributors
    will either leave Nix entirely or collaborate on a fork. Nix will have competition
    by way of those who care.

    for a more peaceful, collaborative environment is shared. Yet, some do not see
    the incongruity of their views and actions with those opposing them. This piece
    is not likely to sway any of these parties, but still the reader is encouraged
    to reflect on these events and their forthcoming effects. The actions taken today
    will disturb the sobriety of tomorrow unless due care is taken. Perhaps we can
    all do better for each other.
