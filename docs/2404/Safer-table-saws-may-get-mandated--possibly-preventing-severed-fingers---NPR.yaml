    stranger to power tools. Back before his accident, he'd seen a demonstration of
    a new and much safer type of table saw at a local woodworking store. Marketed
    under the name SawStop, it was designed to [stop and retract the spinning blade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYLAi4jwXcs)
    within a few milliseconds of making contact with flesh — fast enough to turn a
    potentially life-changing injury into little more than a scratch. Noffsinger's
    table saw wasn't equipped with the high-tech safety feature because manufacturers
    aren't required to include it.

    (CPSC) appears poised to mandate a SawStop-type safety brake on all new table

    (AIM) system, which sends a small electrical charge through the saw blade, and
    because skin is conductive, the system senses whether the blade is touched. Basically,
    wood doesn't conduct electricity, but people do. When a hand comes in contact

    This occurs so quickly that there's not enough time for a serious injury.

    To stave off potential competitors, it describes the AIM technology very broadly.
    In a surprise move at February's CPSC hearing, TTS Tooltechnic Systems North America
    CEO Matt Howard announced that the company would "dedicate the 840 patent to the
    public" if a new safety standard were adopted. Howard says that this would free
    up rivals to pursue their own safety devices or simply copy SawStop's. At the
    hearing, he challenged them "to get in the game."

    power tool companies. Before starting SawStop, the inventor of its technology,
    [Steve Gass](https://www.npr.org/2011/05/25/136617222/advocates-urge-lawmakers-to-make-table-saws-safer)
    — himself a patent attorney — tried to interest manufacturers in licensing his
    idea. He got no takers. And years later, when Bosch Power Tools began selling
    a saw with its own version of an injury-mitigation system, SawStop [won a patent-infringement
    suit](https://www.sawstop.com/news/sawstop-sues-bosch-to-protect-inventions/)
    against the company. TTS subsequently agreed to let Bosch sell the saw, but Bosch
    never reintroduced it to the U.S. market.

    himself who was injured.

    But these types of saw injuries are especially challenging and difficult to repair,
    he says. Unlike a clean amputation from a sharp cooking knife, he explains, a
    table saw blade actually obliterates the tissue. "It's a vaporizing type of injury,"
    he says, adding that replantation typically requires hours of meticulous microsurgery.
