  zh: 理查德·博多尔，一位驻圣地亚哥的整形外科医生，对锯片可能造成的手部灾难性伤害非常了解。
- en: The one he remembers most vividly occurred about 25 years ago, before SawStops
    were on the market. While he was operating one night to replant an amputated finger,
    the emergency room called about another "four-finger replant" being referred from
    Bodor's colleague — a senior surgeon and mentor. At first, Bodor thought his colleague
    was simply inquiring about another patient. He soon realized it was the surgeon
    himself who was injured.

  zh: 他最清楚地记得发生在大约25年前的一起事故，在SawStops上市之前。当他一夜间进行手术以重新植回一根被切断的手指时，急诊室打来电话，说博多尔的同事
    — 一位资深外科医生和导师 — 又有一个“四指植回”案例转介。起初，博多尔以为他的同事只是询问另一个病人的情况。他很快意识到，受伤的是那位外科医生本人。
- en: That surgeon had been operating a table saw when his glove caught the saw blade
    and pulled in his hand. Bodor says the injured surgeon was surprisingly calm during
    pre-op, as the two discussed the complicated procedure to reconstruct the man's
    mangled hand.

  zh: 那位外科医生在使用台锯时，手套被锯片卷入并拉住了他的手。博多尔说，在术前，受伤的外科医生出奇地镇定，两人讨论了重建这名男子残破手部的复杂手术过程。
- en: Referring to each of his shredded fingers, the injured surgeon applied his own
    expertise to the reconstruction. "'I think this finger is going to make it. Now,
    I'm a little worried about this guy. However, I think this small one might be
    toast,'" Bodor said, recalling their conversation.

- en: After a long recovery, Bodor said, the man eventually was able to resume surgeries.
    But these types of saw injuries are especially challenging and difficult to repair,
    he says. Unlike a clean amputation from a sharp cooking knife, he explains, a
    table saw blade actually obliterates the tissue. "It's a vaporizing type of injury,"
    he says, adding that replantation typically requires hours of meticulous microsurgery.

  zh: 博多尔说，经过长时间的康复，这名男子最终能够恢复手术工作。但是，他说，这类锯伤尤其具有挑战性，很难修复。他解释说，与由锋利的烹饪刀造成的干净截肢不同，台锯刀片实际上会蒸发组织。“这是一种蒸发性的伤害，”他说，并补充说，重新植回通常需要数小时的细致显微外科手术。
