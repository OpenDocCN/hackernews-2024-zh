    tenants are more likely to accept rent hikes. Developing new apartments is expensive
    and time-consuming, which makes it tough for competitors to enter the market.
    Even during shaky periods for the economy, rents tend to hold steady or even climb
    — people still need to live somewhere.

    for landlords. A video on its website heralds the software, known simply as "AI
    Revenue Management," as the "first pricing-optimization tool to fully employ AI
    and machine learning," helping properties "exceed the market by 2% to 5%." In
    other words, the company's clients enjoy revenue increases from year to year that
    are greater than the market average. RealPage's algorithm is fueled by troves
    of granular data on real-time lease transactions, occupancy, and how many units
    are hitting the market, which landlords feed the company as a condition of using
    its services. It's unclear exactly how the company massages all those numbers
    to spit out its price recommendations, but RealPage says it aggregates and anonymizes
    the data from other apartment operators in the area and combines it with other
    public data and the property's internal rent data to arrive at a suggested dollar
    amount. It's "both common and expected" that apartment managers will follow the
    system's pricing recommendations on roughly 80% to 95% of their decisions, RealPage's
    website says.

    ability to capture more revenue. "As a property manager, very few of us would
    be willing to actually raise rents double digits within a single month by doing
    it manually," one RealPage executive said in a since deleted video, according
    to a 2022 investigation by ProPublica. Another apartment manager said in a testimonial

    have shot up by 29.4% since the beginning of the pandemic, averaging an annual
    increase of 7% over the past four years, Zillow found. Almost two-thirds of that
    increase happened in 2021 alone, the peak of the pandemic-era housing market.
    Of course, there were many factors driving up rents back then that had nothing
    to do with algorithms, most notably an increase in household formation — people
    broke up with their roommates, moved out of their parents'' houses, or simply
    upgraded to more space — so it''s hard to know exactly how much to ascribe to
    the algorithms. But information asymmetry is part of the bigger problem. Apartment
    owners have access to all kinds of market data through RealPage''s algorithm,
    while tenants suffer from a lack of information — some can''t even figure out
    who actually owns their apartment behind a web of LLCs. The plaintiffs allege
    that RealPage clients provide data to the company knowing that many of their competitors
    are doing the same and that they would all benefit by participating. In fact,
    the lawsuits claim that RealPage shares "peer lists" with clients that tell them
    exactly who else is providing data to the company within a specific distance of
    their property.'

    even greater anticompetitive threat" than anything that had come before. By sharing
    private information and surrendering their decision-making to the software, companies

    a much higher standard, Ed Rogers, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr who
    specializes in antitrust cases, told me. To avoid this, the plaintiffs will try

    agreed with one another to use RealPage to collectively raise prices, or at least
    used its software knowing and expecting that their competitors would do the same

    a partner at the law firm Smith Gambrell Russell, told me. For example, a court
    might look at whether apartment owners had strong incentives to collude, whether
    they knew who else was participating, whether participation was enforced in some
    way, and whether they all took similar actions at the same time, like raising
    prices in unison. The judge could also consider whether the competitors knew that
    the price increases could succeed only if everyone did the same. But proving a
    rim this way is "much more difficult," Cross said.
