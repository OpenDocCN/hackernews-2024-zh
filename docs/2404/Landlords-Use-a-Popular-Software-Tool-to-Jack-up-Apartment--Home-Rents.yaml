  zh: 当然，RealPage 绝非疫情期间租金上涨的唯一原因。由于过去几年新建了大量公寓楼，全国各地的租金在一些地区正在[停滞甚至下降](https://www.businessinsider.com/rent-decline-fall-apartment-housing-market-landlords-tenant-lease-construction-2023-3)。但在这些案件中的原告仍然争辩说，如果没有
    RealPage，租赁市场对租户会更有利；如果公寓业主不能依赖算法，他们可能会推迟租金上涨或更频繁地降低价格。他们也可能更愿意就租约续订进行谈判。
- en: But we have a long way to go before knowing whether these changes will come
    to pass. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into RealPage
    and some of its customers, Politico reported, adding to the mounting pressure
    on the company and its clients. The lawsuits filed by the Washington, DC, and
    Arizona attorneys general will work their way through their respective judicial
    systems, while the federal antitrust cases have been consolidated before a judge
    in Tennessee. The first of those cases was filed in 2022, so they're still in
    the early stages — it could be years before we even see a trial.

  zh: 但在了解这些变化是否会发生之前，我们还有很长的路要走。据 Politico 报道，司法部已对 RealPage 及其部分客户展开刑事调查，增加了对该公司及其客户的压力。由华盛顿特区和亚利桑那州检察长提起的诉讼将在各自的司法系统中进行，而联邦反垄断案件已在田纳西州一名法官面前合并审理。这些案件中的第一起案件于
    2022 年提起，因此它们仍处于早期阶段 —— 我们可能还要等待多年才能看到审判。
- en: Whenever that day comes, it'll be worth watching. The RealPage cases are about
    far more than apartment rents. If the plaintiffs can successfully argue that property
    managers engaged in price fixing by using RealPage's algorithm, they could open
    the door for all kinds of industries to face similar scrutiny.

  zh: 不管那一天什么时候到来，都将值得关注。RealPage 的案件远不止于公寓租金。如果原告能够成功地主张物业经理通过使用 RealPage 的算法进行价格垄断，他们可能会为所有行业面临类似审查敞开大门。

    to price plane tickets, and experts have pointed out that the industry is especially
    susceptible to collusion because it is dominated by just a handful of major players.
    The Federal Trade Commission has accused Amazon of [using a secret algorithm](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-used-secret-algorithm-raise-rival-site-prices-antitrust-lawsuit-2023-11)
    to see whether it could raise prices and prompt other businesses to follow suit.
    Just recently, the Justice Department and the FTC filed *another* statement of
    interest in a case that accuses casino-hotel operators of propping up prices by
    using a common algorithm. The platform in question is called Rainmaker.
