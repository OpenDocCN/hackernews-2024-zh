    on Steam that it's removing 20 years' worth of Nintendo-related workshop items
    for its sandbox game [*Garry's Mod*](https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-26-garrys-mod-tops-3-5-million-sold-continues-to-pick-up-steam.html)
    to comply with the Japanese company's demands. Earlier this year, an X user with
    the name Brewster T. Koopa [posted](https://twitter.com/brewsterkoopa/status/1756767363112763649)
    that a group of trolls was filing false DMCA claims against the game to get Nintendo
    add-ons removed and to get add-on makers to shut down. The perpetrators allegedly
    used a fake email to impersonate Nintendo's lawyers to send DMCA takedown notices.
    Facepunch Studios said in its new announcement, that it believes the demands legitimately
    came from Nintendo and that it has to respect the company's decision and start
    taking down items related to its IPs.

    it know that the demands aren't actually from Nintendo. They previously argued
    that the takedown notices couldn't be from the Japanese gaming giant, because
    Nintendo add-ons have been around since 2005 and because the company would've
    contacted Valve, the publisher of *Garry's Mod*, itself.

    that his team has received people's emails and DMs and that the developer is conducting
    an investigation. "We need to take these things seriously (particularly from Nintendo),
    but we also can't let people misuse DMCA takedowns," Newman wrote. We've reached
    out to Nintendo to ask whether the takedowns Facepunch received truly came from
    the company, and we'll update this post once they respond.

    our own investigations. We need to take these things seriously (particularly from
    Nintendo), but we also can't let people misuse DMCA takedowns.
