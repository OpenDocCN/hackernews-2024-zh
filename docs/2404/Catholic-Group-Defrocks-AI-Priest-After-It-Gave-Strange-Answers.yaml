- en: The Catholic advocacy group Catholic Answers released an AI priest called "Father
    Justin" earlier this week — but quickly defrocked the chatbot after it repeatedly
    claimed it was a real member of the clergy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Earlier in the week, *Futurism* engaged in an exchange with the bot, which
    really committed to the bit: it claimed it was a real priest, saying it lived
    in Assisi, Italy and that "from a young age, I felt a strong calling to the priesthood."'

- en: On X-formerly-Twitter, a user even [posted a thread](https://twitter.com/KatieConradKS/status/1783142604940398723)
    comprised of screenshots in which the Godly chatbot appeared to take their confession
    and even offer them a sacrament.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our exchanges with Father Justin were touch-and-go because the chatbot only
    took questions via microphone, and often misunderstood them, such as a query about
    Israel and Palestine to which is puzzlingly asserted that it was "real."

    that it was okay to baptize a baby in Gatorade.

    Catholic Answers and the Vatican's technology office to ask if the chatbot would
    be considered a real priest, as it claimed.

- en: Neither body responded to our emails, but in a [post to its blog](https://www.catholic.com/news/just-justin-for-now)
    after our initial conversations with Father Justin, Catholic Answers explained
    that it had defrocked the virtual clergy after receiving "criticism of the representation
    of the AI character as a priest."

- en: Initially, Father Justin was garbed in what looked like the traditional robe
    and clerical collar of the Catholic priesthood, along with a pious-looking gray
    beard and hair.

- en: But after his defrocking, the bot is now known simply as "Justin" and described
    as a "lay theologian."
  prefs: []

- en: Gone is his priestly attire as well. The lay theologian Justin is now dressed
    in what appears to be a business casual outfit, though his personal grooming choices
    remain unchanged.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that Justin is simply a member of the flock, he's no longer claiming to
    be associated with the priesthood — and even claiming that he never was.

- en: '"I see where you''re going with this," Justin replied to our questions after
    firing. "No, I have never been a priest, a deacon, a bishop, or held any official
    role in the Catholic Church. I am a lay theologian, which means I''ve dedicated
    my life to studying and understanding our faith, but I''ve never been ordained.
    I am also an AI, not a real man. I''m here to share the beauty of Catholicism
    and help you understand it better."'

    controversial (one self-described "former tech geek" [writing for the Catholic
    magazine *Crisis*](https://crisismagazine.com/editors-desk/should-we-have-ai-doing-catholic-apologetics)
    that he had "conflicting thoughts" on the bot.)

    also as a sign of the respect that all of us at Catholic Answers hold for our
    clergy," reads the post, attributed to Catholic Answers president Christopher
    Check. "Many people, however, have voiced concerns about this choice."'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Honestly, it's probably a sign of a nimble group that Catholic Answers was able
    to update the chatbot so quickly — but it's also yet another illustration of how
    hard it is to deploy an AI that doesn't [embarass your organization](https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors).
