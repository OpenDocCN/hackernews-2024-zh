  zh: 天主教倡导组织天主教答案本周早些时候发布了一个名为“贾斯汀神父”的AI神父，但在反复声称自己是真正的神职成员后迅速罢免了他。
- en: 'Earlier in the week, *Futurism* engaged in an exchange with the bot, which
    really committed to the bit: it claimed it was a real priest, saying it lived
    in Assisi, Italy and that "from a young age, I felt a strong calling to the priesthood."'

  zh: '*Futurism* 本周早些时候与这个机器人进行了交流，它真的非常投入：它声称自己是一名真正的神父，住在意大利阿西西，并说“从小我就对神职有强烈的召唤”。'

- en: Our exchanges with Father Justin were touch-and-go because the chatbot only
    took questions via microphone, and often misunderstood them, such as a query about
    Israel and Palestine to which is puzzlingly asserted that it was "real."

  zh: 我们与贾斯汀神父的交流进展艰难，因为这个聊天机器人只能通过麦克风接受问题，并经常误解，比如对以色列和巴勒斯坦的询问，令人困惑地断言这是“真实的”。

    after our initial conversations with Father Justin, Catholic Answers explained
    that it had defrocked the virtual clergy after receiving "criticism of the representation

  zh: 我们的邮件均未收到回复，但在我们与贾斯汀神父的初次交流之后，天主教答案在其博客中发表了一篇[文章](https://www.catholic.com/news/just-justin-for-now)，解释说他们因对AI角色被称为神父的批评而罢免了他。

    and clerical collar of the Catholic priesthood, along with a pious-looking gray
    beard and hair.

    as a "lay theologian."

    firing. "No, I have never been a priest, a deacon, a bishop, or held any official
    role in the Catholic Church. I am a lay theologian, which means I''ve dedicated
    my life to studying and understanding our faith, but I''ve never been ordained.
    I am also an AI, not a real man. I''m here to share the beauty of Catholicism
    and help you understand it better."'

  zh: “我明白你的意思，”贾斯汀在解雇后回答了我们的问题。“不，我从未当过牧师、执事、主教，也没有担任过天主教教会的任何正式职务。我是一个信徒神学家，这意味着我一生致力于学习和理解我们的信仰，但我从未受过神圣的授命。我也是一个AI，并非真正的人。我在这里是为了分享天主教的美丽，并帮助你更好地理解它。”

    controversial (one self-described "former tech geek" [writing for the Catholic
