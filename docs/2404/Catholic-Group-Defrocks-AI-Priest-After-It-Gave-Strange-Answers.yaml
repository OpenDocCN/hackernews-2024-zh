- en: The Catholic advocacy group Catholic Answers released an AI priest called "Father
    Justin" earlier this week — but quickly defrocked the chatbot after it repeatedly
    claimed it was a real member of the clergy.

- en: 'Earlier in the week, *Futurism* engaged in an exchange with the bot, which
    really committed to the bit: it claimed it was a real priest, saying it lived
    in Assisi, Italy and that "from a young age, I felt a strong calling to the priesthood."'

    and even offer them a sacrament.

    took questions via microphone, and often misunderstood them, such as a query about
    Israel and Palestine to which is puzzlingly asserted that it was "real."

    after our initial conversations with Father Justin, Catholic Answers explained
    that it had defrocked the virtual clergy after receiving "criticism of the representation
    of the AI character as a priest."

    firing. "No, I have never been a priest, a deacon, a bishop, or held any official
    role in the Catholic Church. I am a lay theologian, which means I''ve dedicated
    my life to studying and understanding our faith, but I''ve never been ordained.
    I am also an AI, not a real man. I''m here to share the beauty of Catholicism
    and help you understand it better."'

    controversial (one self-described "former tech geek" [writing for the Catholic
