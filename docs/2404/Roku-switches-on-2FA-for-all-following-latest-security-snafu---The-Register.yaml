    591,000 customer accounts earlier this year.

- en: That's as specific as Roku went in terms of a timeline, but it said that the
    compromises occurred over two separate incidents. The first affected 15,363 accounts,
    which prompted the company to start monitoring account activity more closely in
    March, it said, and this monitoring led to the discovery of a second incident
    affecting roughly 576,000 accounts.

    and Roku hardware using the payment details stored in the user accounts, the company

    the accounts were accessed via credential stuffing attacks that used stolen credentials
    from other sources.

- en: Credential stuffing and password spraying are both fairly similar types of brute
    force attacks, but the former uses known pairs of credentials (usernames and passwords).
    The latter simply spams common passwords at known usernames in the hope one of
    them leads to an authenticated session.
