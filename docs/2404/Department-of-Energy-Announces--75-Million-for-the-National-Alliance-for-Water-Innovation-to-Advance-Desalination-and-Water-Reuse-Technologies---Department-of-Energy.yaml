- en: '*Washington, D.C.* - Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced renewed
    funding for the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI), DOE’s energy innovation
    hub for desalination. With $75 million over five years for this second phase of
    the Hub, NAWI will continue to bring together a team of industry and academic
    partners to examine the critical technical barriers and research needed to radically
    lower the cost and energy of water purification technologies. The advancements
    in desalination technologies will help propel the modernization of America’s water
    infrastructure, increase access to clean, potable water for all Americans, and
    move the country toward a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.'

    energy source, and energy is critical to transporting and treating water,” said
    Jeff Marootian, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of Energy Efficiency
    and Renewable Energy. “The deep connection between these two resources demands
    an integrated approach that considers the challenges and opportunities inherent
    to both sectors. The Department of Energy is proud to be leading the nation’s
    efforts to decarbonize the water economy, while ensuring a secure water future
    for communities nationwide.”

- en: Current water supply systems in the U.S. rely primarily on fresh surface and
    groundwater, with a small percentage coming from desalinated salt water. However,
    climate change, population growth, greater industrial and agricultural demand,
    and changes in how communities use water are placing increasing stress on these
    fresh water supplies worldwide. To supply the water needs of the future, it is
    critical that the U.S. develop technologies that provide alternative water sources
    and treat and use water in ways that are efficient, sustainable, cost-effective,
    and minimize energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

- en: NAWI and other partners across industry, government, and academia are investing
    in technologies to mitigate these effects on the water cycle. These technologies
    will focus on treating water from alternative sources like brackish groundwater
    and various wastewaters to create more fit-for-purpose water while reducing emissions
    and energy use associated with traditional water treatment. In its first five
    years, NAWI funded more than 60 projects, including pilots, projects across the
    United States focusing on a combination of water treatment, desalination unit
    processes, novel automation and water treatment, desalination processes, and modeling
    tools and analysis. This included projects from early-stage research through pilot
    scale. Additionally, the hub published the [NAWI Master Roadmap](https://www.nawihub.org/knowledge/roadmap-publication-series/)
    and five sector-specific roadmaps (power, resource extraction, industry, municipal,
    and agriculture) as they relate to key technical challenges and research priorities
    in desalination and treatment of nontraditional source waters. power, resource
