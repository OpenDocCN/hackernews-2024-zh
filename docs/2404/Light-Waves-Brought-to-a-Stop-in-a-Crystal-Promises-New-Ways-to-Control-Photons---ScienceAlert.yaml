    tracks could lead to more advanced photonic devices, such as lasers, LED displays,
    fiber-optics, and sensors.

    scientists have found a flexible new way to make light waves stand absolutely
    still.

- en: Light can be brought to a halt in a few different ways, such as by cooling clouds
    of atoms or even [braiding light waves together](https://www.sciencealert.com/using-exceptional-points-coalescing-waves-stopping-light).
    This new method, from AMOLF and Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands,
    has advantages that could bring new technological applications to reality.

    enhance their strength," [says physicist Ewold Verhagen](https://amolf.nl/news/light-stands-still-in-a-deformed-crystal)
    of [AMOLF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLF). "Realizing this on a chip is
    particularly important for many applications."'

    such as [graphene](https://www.sciencealert.com/graphene). In a conducting material,
    electrons can move freely, zooming along like a tiny highway. However, applying
    a magnetic field can restrict movement of the electrons to certain energies, known
    as [Landau levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau_levels).

- en: It's not only magnets that push electrons to Landau levels. Two-dimensional
    graphene, consisting of a single layer of atoms, can do it too. Normally, graphene
    is conductive; but if you warp or distort the graphene, such as by stretching
    it, you can confine the electrons to Landau levels, turning the normally conductive
    material into an insulator.

    sought to find out if they could find a material that had a similar effect on
    photons to the one that warped graphene has on electrons.

    photonic crystal. And the researchers found that they could stall light waves
    in a similar fashion.

    of holes in a silicon layer. Light can move freely in this material, just like
    electrons in graphene," [Barczyk explains](https://amolf.nl/news/light-stands-still-in-a-deformed-crystal).'

    and consequently lock the photons. This is how we create Landau levels for photons."'

- en: The team's honeycombed photonic crystals were able to confine light to Landau
    levels using a process that represented different kinds of deformation, such as
    curving or warping. And they were even able to induce different types of warping
    at different places in the same material, resulting in a photonic crystal in which
    light can flow freely in some parts, but becomes confined in others.

    closer to the fine control of light on very small scales.

    its strength will be enhanced tremendously. And not only at one location, but
    over the entire crystal surface. Such light concentration is very important in
    nanophotonic devices, for example for the development of efficient lasers or quantum
    light sources."'
