    music website of the last twenty-five years, ceased publication, “that would probably
    be the end of the album review as we know it, right?” For anyone attuned to online

- en: A couple factors explain why quality criticism is hard to come by. Most obviously,
    music is tough to capture in words. “I could spend paragraphs describing a sound
    and it wouldn’t compare to even a few moments listening to the track itself,”
    a former music editor at *LA Weekly* [once said](https://www.vice.com/da/article/rze5a8/is-the-album-review-dead).
    For another, writers are hampered by unnecessary schedules. The idea that reviews
    need to come out around the same time as the record in order to drum up hype is
    an outdated PR strategy that has been depleted, if not entirely obsolesced, by
    streaming platforms and social media. *Pitchfork* popularized this approach and
    has continued to abide by it. Between 1998 and 2017, they [published](https://nolanbconaway.github.io/blog/2017/pitchfork-roundup.html)
    five reviews every weekday, with almost all of them pegged to the day each album
    under review was released. Founded in 1996 in the bedroom of a Minnesota teenager
    named Ryan Schreiber, the site primarily championed its founder’s and his friends’
    favorite indie rock, such as the bands 12 Rods and Walt Mink. For a long time,
    the basic business model was ad revenue–based, with the site [approaching](https://slate.com/culture/2024/03/pitchfork-oral-history-music-festival-conde-nast-review.html)
    labels like Thrill Jockey to spend on display ads. The masthead was almost all

    Schreiber的少年在卧室里创建，主要支持其创始人及其朋友最喜欢的独立摇滚乐队，如12 Rods和Walt Mink。很长一段时间，基本的商业模式是基于广告收入的，该网站[接近](https://slate.com/culture/2024/03/pitchfork-oral-history-music-festival-conde-nast-review.html)Thrill

    edge over established print music magazines. Unlike its competitors, it also paid
    more attention to artists you wouldn’t hear on mainstream radio. If you wanted
    to find out whether the latest Radiohead record was worth your time, you didn’t
    have to wait for the next issue of *Spin* to hit the shelves. Brent DiCrescenzo’s
    [review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6656-kid-a/) of *Kid A*, published
    on the day of the album’s release (October 2, 2000), was pivotal to the site’s
    early success. By this point, contributors had become infamous for their provocative,
    freewheeling, though often confusing prose, but DiCrescenzo’s write-up took it
    to the max. His assessment went viral—at least by pre–social media standards—and
    has since been [credited](https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/radiohead-kid-a-pitchfork-review-brent-discrescenzo-2000-9342543/amp/)
    as a defining moment for music criticism. Or rather, it was an example of what
    you could get away with under the loose constraints around music criticism in
    the blogging era, with complete disregard to cogency. “Comparing this to other
    albums is like comparing an aquarium to blue construction paper,” DiCrescenzo
    wrote. As that hyperbole suggests, he didn’t really have an argument. But his
    rating felt like enough of a justification in itself—not five stars, but a perfect
    10.0.

    music magazines. Initially reviewers themselves rated albums, picking a score

    Trump, whatever got the word count over five hundred. In each instance, it’s as
    if the writer is saying, “I don’t want to do this review. This vaguely profound
    theme feels more interesting, so I will try to relate it to this album.” Of course,
    these half-baked formulas didn’t drive view counts. Instead, letting writers briefly
    muse on abstract topics only vaguely connected to the album itself was a way to
    afford this engagement bait a modicum of critical shrewdness. This was emblematic
    of the delusion the site had locked itself into: that careful, considered insight
    could be cranked out at the rate of, well, *GQ*. In the bid to get traffic, *Pitchfork*’s
    editors couldn’t afford to put the editorial calendar on hold and face the fact
    that shrewdness does not grow on a content farm; the conditions are inhospitable
    for that kind of crop.'

  zh: 这种风格在评论的结束段落尤为明显，作家试图在音乐与我们生活世界之间建立一些脆弱的联系：疲惫，晚期资本主义，特朗普统治下的生活，不管能让字数超过五百的是什么。在每一个例子中，就好像作家在说：“我不想做这个评论。这种模糊的深刻主题更有趣，所以我会试图将它与这张专辑联系起来。”当然，这些半吊子的公式并没有带来浏览量。相反，让作家简短地思考与专辑本身只有微弱联系的抽象主题，是一种让这种引起参与的垂钓稍稍具备批判性机智的方式。这是该网站陷入的幻觉的象征：即仔细、深思熟虑的见解可以像*GQ*一样大量生产。在争取流量的竞争中，*Pitchfork*的编辑们无法把编辑日历搁置一旁，面对这样一个事实：机智并不会在内容农场上生长；那里的条件对那样的收获是不利的。
- en: Comparing this phase of reviews to the DiCrescenzo era, it’s a sign of maturity
    to outgrow shock value, but it’s not a bad business move either. Brands are less
    wary about purchasing ad space in media outlets with inoffensive content, and
    music publications discovered they could drive more traffic when they featured
    artists who more readers knew and enjoyed. The annual Pitchfork Music Festival
    launched in 2006, but the site couldn’t rely on that flagship event for year-round
    revenue. In retrospect, we can see that *Pitchfork*’s increased coverage of Top
    40 artists coincided with the enhanced competition they faced from other music
    blogs for ad dollars. The critical lens known as “poptimism,” which treats Top
    40 hits as middlebrow art, certainly didn’t repel luxury fashion and lifestyle
    brands from taking out homepage banners. *Pitchfork* was an online music magazine
    as much as it was a growth-hungry startup.

  zh: 将这一时期的评论与DiCrescenzo时代相比，这是一种成熟的标志，超越了震撼价值，但这也不是一个坏的商业举措。品牌对在没有冒犯性内容的媒体上购买广告位不再持谨慎态度，音乐出版物发现，当他们展示更多读者熟知和喜爱的艺术家时，他们可以带来更多流量。*Pitchfork*音乐节于2006年首次举办，但该网站不能依赖这一旗舰活动获得全年收入。回顾来看，*Pitchfork*对Top
    40艺术家的增加报道正好与他们面对的来自其他音乐博客的广告收入竞争加剧相吻合。所谓的“流行乐观主义”批评视角将Top 40热门歌曲视为中层艺术，当然不会阻止奢侈时尚和生活方式品牌在首页横幅上购买广告位。*Pitchfork*既是一个在线音乐杂志，也是一个追求增长的初创企业。

    album from the past” that had yet to be covered by the publication. These weren’t

    each written about for its own sake. From what I could tell, the Sunday Reviews
    themselves reignited buzz around certain records. I had never heard of The Blue
    Nile until Sam Sodomsky’s [2018 essay](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-blue-nile-hats/)
    on their album *Hats*, and I got the sense more people were paying attention to
    the band in the months after that piece went live. (It helped readers, myself
    included, come to the realization that the Blue Nile is who The 1975 struggles
    to rip off.) The Sunday Reviews series launched less than a year after the Condé
    Nast acquisition, when *Pitchfork* had added weekends to its editorial calendar
    and needed space to fill. Given its emergence under these narrow circumstances,
    I worry that writers and editors believe retrospective writing can only be one-off.

    for the *Guardian*, Laura Snapes recounted a recent experience: “Pitchfork surprised
    me by accepting a Sunday Review pitch on an astonishingly obscure album . . .
    the kind of piece we couldn’t justify here [in the *Guardian*] as it has little
    cultural currency or news relevance.” Clicks may be pivotal to revenue, but we
    should resist the logic that says traffic, much less relevance, can only follow
    preexisting virality. Great criticism can establish the premise for a cultural
    object’s relevance—whether positive or negative—independent of a press hook. In
    practice, music media allows the noteworthiness of previously released music to
    be contrived whenever a label decides to reissue an album from its back catalog,
    or it’s instead determined by round numbers, as if art only finds readers when
    it turns twenty and not when it turns nineteen or twenty-one. To believe that
    a retrospective essay on an older, lesser-known cultural artifact (and not just
    anyone’s essay, but your own!) by its nature “has little cultural currency or
    news relevance” is ultimately the fault of *Pitchfork* and the breakneck editorial
    model it popularized, and it speaks to how deeply news-peg brain has embedded
    itself into the minds of people who think about art for a living.'

    Finding ways to treat album reviews more like long-form book reviews—and to give
    critics more time to sit with albums—would be a good place to start. If *Pitchfork*’s
    Sunday Reviews were any indication, the passage of time is conducive to richer
    analysis and commentary for music just as it is for a lot of literature and nonfiction,
    where that’s already the norm. In addition to review essays on single albums,
    critics might be signed up to review multiple albums, whether from the same artist
    or different artists from the same local scenes or subgenres. More space could
    be devoted to in-depth artist profiles and Q&As. And ratings should be dispensed
    with entirely.

- en: My hunch is that readers will be more eager to pay for subscriptions if they
    know they’re getting quality work in return. The patient approach might also make
    it possible to commission more first-time contributors on a regular basis. As
    with most big-name arts publications, *Pitchfork*’s editors typically defaulted
    to assigning records to insiders and freelancer buddies because they didn’t have
    time to sift through pitches from writers they didn’t know. It was always a surprise
    to see an unfamiliar byline on the website. When there’s more time to write about
    new music, there’s more time to field well-rounded pitches from a diversity of
    perspectives, and less of an excuse to be cliquey out of convenience.

    music for a living. For an artist or critic to secure a smidge of income, they
    face top-down pressure to be formulaic at the expense of originality, experimentation,
    and slow craft. Musicians optimize themselves for streaming platforms, basing
    their creative choices on what will boost monthly listeners and land their tracks
    on mood-based playlists. These metrics now factor into whether an artist deserves
    to get a record deal or booked to play live (the shows, of course, being at venues
    that take a majority cut from the evening’s revenue). Meanwhile, as Spotify has
    monopolized music discovery, *Pitchfork,* along with *Spin*, *Consequence of Sound*,
    and other corporate-owned music sites, continues to pump out content in a futile
    race against the algorithms, resulting in half-baked, largely short-form reviews
    that parrot press releases. Writers are afforded precious little time, money,

    of the Austin festival’s owner, Penske Media. Penske also owns *Rolling Stone*,
    the website of which just begs not to be read, congested as it is with paywalls
    and targeted ads. Prospective contributors who fail to get hold of any editors
    on the masthead have the option to join *Rolling Stone*’s “Culture Council” initiative,
    a pay-to-publish initiative available for a $2,000 annual buy-in. Conglomerates
    like Penske have shrunk the gap between culture’s commentators and its producers
