- en: Penelope Fitzgerald was a novelist of genius. In the 1980s and 1990s she wrote
    some of the great fiction of the twentieth century. She won the Booker Prize in
    1979 (and was nominated another three times) and the American National Books Critics
    Circle Award in 1998\. Philip Hensher said, after she died, “Of all the novelists
    of the last quarter-century, she has the most unarguable claim on greatness.”
    To A.S. Byatt, she was “Jane Austen’s nearest heir for precision and invention.”
    Robert McCrum included her in his list of the hundred best novels. Despite the
    fact that she initially had to endure the sort of reviews women were given in
    the 1980s (Valentine Cunningham called *The Bookshop* “anguished women’s fiction”)
    her reputation has grown since she died in 2000 and she is being realised as one
    of the great writers of the twentieth century.

- en: Penelope Fitzgerald had been expected to be a prodigy. She was a Knox, a family
    of writers, thinkers, code breakers, and priests. It was competitive and intellectual.
    She went to the same Oxford college as her mother (who died when she was eighteen),
    and wrote when she went down that she was ready to start writing. The fact that
    she was fifty-eight, rather than twenty-one, when her first book came out is the
    big mystery of her life. Why did she start so late?

  zh: Penelope Fitzgerald 本来被期望成为一个神童。她是诺克斯家族的一员，一个由作家、思想家、密码破译者和牧师组成的家族。这是一个充满竞争和智力的环境。她与母亲去同一所牛津学院（母亲在她18岁时去世），并在离开学校时写下，她已经准备好开始写作了。她的第一本书出版时已经58岁了，而不是21岁，这是她生命中的一个大谜。她为什么开始得如此晚呢？
- en: 'Two basic answers have been given to this question. The first is men: her husband
    was a hindrance, emotionally and financially. His drinking, a failed career at
    the bar, and an erratic life caused by the pursuit of creditors, left Fitzgerald
    with little time or energy for writing. For many years she slept on a sofa bed
    in the sitting room. And her intense childhood might have been a burden. In support
    of this, we might cite the fact that she began her first book just after her father
    died and her second as her husband lay dying.'
  id: totrans-split-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 有两个基本答案给出了这个问题的解释。第一个是她的丈夫：他在情感和经济上成了她的绊脚石。他的酗酒问题、在律师事业上的失败和由于追债而不稳定的生活，使得费兹杰拉德几乎没有时间和精力写作。多年来，她都睡在客厅的沙发床上。她童年的激烈经历可能也是一个负担。为此，我们可以引用这样一个事实：她在父亲去世后立即开始写她的第一本书，而在丈夫奄奄一息之时，她又开始了第二本书的创作。
- en: 'The other answer given is that she wasn’t, in fact, such a late starter. Critics
    point to her childhood stories, anonymous reviews for the *Times Literary Supplement*,
    her probable contributions to Desmond’s history of the Irish Guards, and the literary
    magazine she and Desmond ran together when the children were little. There were
    also four short stories she wrote earlier in life: two as a young child, two in
    the 1950s when she was a mother. (Fitzgerald wrote very few short stories overall.)
    We know about these from a notebook entry where she listed them with dates in
    1997, when she was eighty-one. The title of the first story on the list, written
    aged six, was later lightly crossed out. As an undergraduate, she wrote brief
    paragraph length parodies of Victorian and Edwardian fiction along with some other
    contributions to the university magazine. It also seems likely that she published
    a short story under her husband’s name in 1951, but this is impossible to verify.
    Taken together these are meant to provide an explanation for the fact that Penelope
    started writing fiction when most other people start retiring. The most recent
    critical study, part of the *Writers at Work* series, manages to take both of
    these standard lines that Desmond held her back and that she wasn’t a late starter
    at all.'

  zh: 其他解释是，事实上，她并不是一个晚期开始的作家。评论家指出她的童年故事，匿名为《泰晤士文学补充》写的评论，她可能为爱尔兰卫队历史作品做出的贡献，以及她和丹尼斯共同经营的文学杂志。还有四个她年轻时写的短篇小说：两篇是她小时候写的，两篇是在她做母亲时的1950年代写的。（菲茨杰拉德总体上写了很少的短篇小说。）我们是从她在81岁时的1997年的笔记中得知这些的，她在笔记中列出了这些作品以及日期。清单上第一篇故事的标题是她六岁时写的，后来被轻轻划掉了。在大学时，她写了一些长度为段落的维多利亚和爱德华时代小说的拙劣模仿，以及对大学杂志的其他一些贡献。看起来她可能在1951年用她丈夫的名义发表了一篇短篇小说，但这是不可能验证的。总的来说，这些都是为了解释为什么潘洛普开始写小说时，大多数其他人都开始退休了。最近的一项批评研究，是“作家的创作”系列的一部分，设法同时采纳了这两种标准观点，即丹尼斯阻碍了她，她根本不是一个晚期开始者。
- en: This matters because Fitzgerald’s work is deeply biographical. Her early books,
    *The Bookshop*, *Offshore*, *At Freddies*, *Human Voices*, have obvious roots
    in her own life. The children’s names in *Offshore* are remarkably close to her
    own daughters’ names, and the vivid, detailed stories about them are thought to
    be accurate representations of the state of the family. (In the manuscript, Fitzgerald
    used her own children’s names throughout.) While the later books are based on
    immense, detailed research, there are clear resonances with her life and earlier
    work, such as the state of the marriage in *The Beginning of Spring*, or the discussion
    of materialism which occurred first in *The Bookshop*. Fitzgerald believed in
    poltergeists and was a quietly, but deeply, religious person. Her life was transmogrified
    into art. Even for those late novels, Fitzgerald’s life experiences are essential.
    She could not have written them as a younger woman. And not just because she was
    reshaping and reworking her experiences. Her ethical views were profoundly informed
    by her experiences.

  zh: 这很重要，因为菲茨杰拉德的作品在很大程度上是自传体的。她早期的作品《书店》、《离岸》、《在弗雷迪》、《人类之声》明显源于她自己的生活。《离岸》中的孩子们的名字与她自己女儿的名字非常相似，关于他们的生动、详细的故事被认为是家庭状况的准确表现。（在手稿中，菲茨杰拉德始终使用她自己孩子们的名字。）尽管后来的作品是基于广泛而详细的研究，但与她的生活和早期作品存在明显的共鸣，比如《春天的开始》中的婚姻状态，或者《书店》中首次出现的物质主义讨论。菲茨杰拉德相信扑克鬼，是一个安静而又深沉的虔诚者。她的生活被转化成艺术。即使对于那些后期的小说，菲茨杰拉德的生活经历也是至关重要的。她年轻时无法写出这些作品。并不仅仅是因为她正在重塑和重新创作她的经历。她的道德观念也深受她的经历的影响。
- en: 'In one interview she made a remark usually thought to be cryptic, but which
    we might see as a plain, factual statement, almost a double-bluff: ‘I think you
    can write at any time of your life.’ Without dismissing the other explanations
    of Fitzgerald’s lateness, it is time to start taking this one more seriously.
    Her talents bloomed best late in life. Critics often see her public statements
    as a pose: she pretended to be an old English lady, not a steely novelist of genius.
    In fact, she was both. Why must these identities be incompatible? Fitzgerald inherited
    the culture of understatement that her father and uncles had learned at Eton.
    This wasn’t just a decoy. She told Peter Lennon in 1998, when he accused her of
    being modest, ‘all modesty is considered false modesty… I don’t really think it
    is modesty, I think it is a temperament, that you feel you are either one of life’s
    winners or life’s losers.’ Lennon decided that labels like modesty were insufficient.
    Instead, he said she had an “alert repose.”'

  zh: 在一次采访中，她提出了一个通常被认为是含蓄的论点，但我们可以视为一个明确的、事实性的陈述，甚至是双重策略：“我认为你可以随时创作。”在没有反驳菲茨杰拉德迟到的其他解释的情况下，现在是时候更加认真地考虑这个问题了。她的才智晚年最为盛开。批评家中常常将她的公开言论视为装腔作势：她假装是一位老英国女士，而不是天才小说家。事实上，她是两种形象的结合。为什么这两种身份必须互斥？她继承了父亲和叔叔在伊顿学院学到的谦逊文化。这不是只是装腔作势。1998年，当彼得·莱恩斯指责她谦虚时，她对他说，“所有谦虚都是虚假谦虚……我认为这不仅是谦虚，而是气性，你感到自己是生活的赢家还是输家。”莱恩斯决定，诸如谦虚之类的标签不足以概括她。相反，他表示她具有“警惕的宁静”。
- en: 'It is difficult to take her statement that ‘you can write at any time in your
    life’ at face value precisely because she lived such a turbulent life. (Also because
    at other times she said it was for other reasons, such as because the children
    had grown up. Her comments in interviews were often ironic or evasive.) The circumstances
    of her marriage make her a prime example of a woman born during the First World
    War held back because she was a woman. The presence of some juvenalia and early
    reviews cannot justify this. Most people who write anonymous reviews for the *TLS*
    don’t become genius novelists. This looks at her life backwards. One of the remarkable
    things about Hermione Lee’s *Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life* is the way it shows
    that until her late thirties, when the children were young, Fitzgerald lived an
    interesting, bohemian, Hampstead life, until the money and credit ran out. It
    was just one that didn’t involve writing any fiction.'

  zh: 她说“你可以随时创作”的声明之所以难以信从，恰好源于她动荡的生活。 （此外，因为有时她表示这可能是出于其他原因，比如孩子们已经长大。她的访谈中的评论往往讽刺或回避。）她婚姻中的突发事件使其成为一战期间出生的女性的例子，这些女性因为是女性而被压制。一些少年作品和早期评论不足以解释这一点。为《泰晤士文学增刊》撰写匿名评论的大多数人不会成为天才小说家。这是从后往前看她的生活。赫罗德姆·利伊的《弗朗西斯·哈姆·巴尔的平生》的一点引人注目的是，它表明在她30多岁，孩子还小的时候，菲茨杰拉德的生活是有趣、放荡不羁、汉普斯特德风的生活，直到钱和信用耗尽。这只是一个没有涉及写小说的生活。
- en: Not until *The Bookshop* (published in 1978 when Fitzgerald was 62) did Fitzgerald
    produce a serious work of fiction. She had her children in her thirties, and once
    she started teaching she could, presumably, have made time to write, as writers
    like William Golding did, during school hours. Not all the women novelists of
    the twentieth century lived easy lives. As well as the vicissitudes of her life,
    her father, and her marriage, there must be something about Fitzgerald herself
    that explains her late start. We risk not taking her seriously if we think that
    a difficult marriage and a teaching job are enough to turn a potential genius
    into a mute inglorious Milton. Of course, she might have failed. There are times
    when it seems as if life might have got her down for good. There is a long unwritable
    history of great talent failing to prosper. That is exactly why Fitzgerald’s story
    is so important.

  zh: 直到1978年（菲茨杰拉德62岁时）的《书店》一书，菲茨杰拉德才成功创作了严肃的小说。她30多岁时生育了孩子，如果她开始教书，理论上可以找到时间创作，就像威廉·戈尔丁在上课时间一样。二十世纪的女性小说家并非所有都过着轻松的生活。除了生活中的波折、她的父亲和她的婚姻，菲茨杰拉德本人的某种特质解释了她的起步晚。如果我们认为艰难的婚姻和一份教师工作足以使潜在的天才变成默默无闻的弥尔顿式的失败者，我们就有可能不严肃地对待她。当然，她可能也可能失败。有时候，看起来生命可能永远带给她挫败。巨大的才华无法成功的漫长失意历史正是菲茨杰拉德故事之所以重要的原因。
- en: When she interviewed the South African novelist Christopher Hope in 1989, just
    after she had published the first of her four great historical novels, Fitzgerald
    said, in a quiet aside, ‘Comedy is a very much more cruel thing than tragedy.’
    This aphorism applies to Fitzgerald’s life, as well as her fiction. Like a comedy,
    it seems to have a happy resolution. The disorder and confusion of her early life
    are turned into a series of highly respected, successful novels. But tragedy has
    a release. There is an endpoint. In her own life, Penelope Fitzgerald was often
    trapped with no sight of how things would be resolved. Her characters are often
    in a similar position. Wendy Lesser compares her work to Vermeer, who shows us
    a snapshot that ‘feels like an eternity’. The endings of *The Bookshop*, *Offshore*,
    and *The Beginning of Spring* are deeply ambivalent. There is no sign things are
    guaranteed to get better, even though the disasters have, perhaps, been avoided.
    It is like watching a couple drive off leaving their wedding guests feeling uneasy
    about the suitability of the match. In the margins of her copy of *Middlemarch*,
    Fitzgerald wrote, ‘The characters’ prospects narrow as the novel closes.’ She
    wrote that in her fifties, when her husband Desmond had been disbarred for stealing
    money, when she lived in a council flat after her houseboat had sunk, and when
    she had taken on laborious teaching work, to keep the family financially stable.
    It is difficult not to see it as a personal comment as well as a literary one.

  zh: 当她在1989年采访南非小说家克里斯托弗·霍普时，正好在她出版了四部伟大的历史小说中的第一部后，菲茨杰拉德轻声说道：“喜剧比悲剧更残酷。”这句警句不仅适用于菲茨杰拉德的生活，也适用于她的小说。像喜剧一样，它似乎有一个幸福的结局。她早期生活的混乱和困惑被转化为一系列备受尊重的成功小说。但悲剧有一个出口。有一个终点。在她自己的生活中，佩内洛普·菲茨杰拉德经常陷入困境，看不到事情如何解决的迹象。她的角色经常处于类似的境地。温迪·莱瑟将她的作品比作弗梅尔，后者向我们展示了一个“感觉像永恒”的快照。《书店》、《离岸》和《春天的开始》的结局是深深矛盾的。没有迹象表明事情一定会好转，即使灾难也许已经被避免。这就像看着一对新婚夫妇驾车离开，留下他们的婚礼客人感到对这场婚姻的适合性感到不安。在她的《米德尔马奇》的边注中，菲茨杰拉德写道：“随着小说的结束，人物的前景变窄了。”她在五十多岁时写下这句话，当时她的丈夫德斯蒙德因为盗窃被吊销执照，当她的船屋沉没后，她住在公寓里，并且承担了繁重的教学工作以保持家庭的经济稳定。这不仅仅是一个文学评论，很难不把它看作是一个个人评论。
- en: If we can stop seeing Fitzgerald as ‘late’, and appreciate the role her life
    played in the development of her moral views, we might see that her fiction arrived
    at the right juncture. Yes she finally had the mental space to write (often scribbling

    enabled her to write a sort-of tragi-comic wisdom literature.

- en: Her life was spent immersed in European culture. After Desmond got disbarred
    and became a travel agent’s clerk, she went on package holidays which he could
    book for them. They sat in the rafters at the opera with their own sandwiches.
    As a teacher, the books she most admired and kept coming back to were works like
    *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, by James Joyce. From Fitzgerald’s annotated
    teaching books, Lee gleaned the details of Fitzgerald’s second, lifelong education.
    This long accretion of knowledge is something separate from her childhood and
    Oxford education, and is an essential part of the explanation to the question,
    ‘Howdid she do it?’ If we want to understand how she created what Wendy Lesser
    calls the Russianness and Germanness of her late books, we have to look to her
    life as a teacher, student, and traveller, not just as a put-upon wife of squashed
    brilliance. Both stories are true.

  zh: 在切尔西的Cheyne Walk 106号，那里是伦敦西部经常居住着艺术家、思想家和作家的地方，河泊上停泊着六十艘船屋。有一种持久的河流气味，一种盐味和潮湿的混合气味。鸟类在退潮时啄食废物：乌鸦、鹅、水鸡和鸽子。码头后面是世界尽头住宅区的高塔；对面是整洁、良好保养的玻璃大楼。1960年，佩内洛普·菲茨杰拉德和她的家人搬进了一艘名为Grace的潮湿漏水的船屋。除了梯田房屋、气味和鸟类外，仍然存在的是Lots
    Road发电站和对岸的圣玛丽教堂，这座18世纪的教堂的墙角在阳光下闪耀。

    a novel which ends with a flood; in reality, after three years, the Fitzgeralds’
    houseboat sank. This was fitting. Desmond was drunk and disbarred. They had left
    London to avoid creditors and could only afford to return to the boat. Penelope
    had a teaching job to provide the family with more income than Desmond could manage
    and to compensate for how much he spent on drinking. Their whole lives seemed
    to be sinking.

- en: This is not how she had started. From letters to her university friend Hugh
    Lee, we can see glimpses of her life as a young graduate in 1939, twenty-one years
    before she lived on the boat. We see her going to the ballet with friends, going
    through several “not very serious engagements”, going to a “dreadful diplomatic
    party”, going to the country to “get some air”; but we do not see her writing.
    When she does mention writing she says, “it is one of my minor ambitions to write
    as good letters as you do.” In 1940 she moved from working for the civil service
    to the BBC. It was a demanding position. “I have had to sign their grasping contract
    which says that I have to devote all my time attention and skills, within reasonable
    limits, to the service of the Corporation.”

    1940年，她从公务员转到BBC工作。这是一个要求很高的职位。“我不得不签署他们的贪婪合同，规定我必须在合理范围内全身心地投入到公司服务中。”
- en: This might indicate the strain of her work (she did have to sleep there sometimes)
    or it might simply be part of a general unworldliness about Fitzgerald. She wrote
    to her editor in 1979, “I’m not the sort of person who ever has any money.” In
    1999 she wrote to another editor, in a discussion of copyright, “I feel this paragraph
    makes me sound stupider than I am. But I’m just no good at business.” The main
    character in *The Bookshop*, Florence, thinks that if she always knew where she
    was “down to the last three farthings” as she ought to, to keep the accounts of
    her business, “she would not have the courage to carry on for another day.” It’s
    possible to overstate this side of Fitzgerald. Her editor Stuart Priffit said,
    ‘you could sometimes feel she was impractical but then she would cut through in
    the most direct way and showed she knew exactly what was going on.’ Nonetheless,
    Fitzgerald was so unversed in money her daughters didn’t think she knew what a
    mortgage was. She describes a contract between two bookstores, where one supplies
    the other with books for a small lending library, as “suggestive of a moral philosophy,
    or the laws of an ideal state, rather than a business transaction.” She thought
    money was a “tedious and ungetroundable problem”. Her PR man, she said, “absolutely
    despairs of me, but it is no good pretending to be what you are not.”

    尽管如此，费茨杰拉德对金钱一窍不通，她的女儿们认为她甚至不知道什么是抵押贷款。她描述了两家书店之间的合同，其中一家为另一家提供书籍用于小型借阅图书馆，称其为“道德哲学或理想国家法律的象征，而不是商业交易”。她认为金钱是一个“乏味且无法解决的问题”。她的公关人员说，“他对我完全绝望了，但是假装成不是你自己是没有用的。”

    won the Booker Prize she said she would use the money to buy an iron and a typewriter,
    an example of what many see as her pose as a little old lady. Her reasons for
    buying the typewriter were revealing though, “It’s important to have an electric
    one, you see, with a self threading ribbon, so you don’t get your fingers dirty.”

    to eat all the time to keep my spirits up.” She didn’t lack material to write

    Voices*, written when she was sixty-three. She stopped working for the BBC in
    1945\. She was writing reviews for *Punch* and scripts for the BBC. She was well

    reviewing Lee’s biography, said “The name of the catastrophe was Desmond. Though
    plausible and, by many accounts, personally charming, Desmond was a feckless alcoholic
    who could not sustain much of a career.” Hensher sees Desmond as the interruption,
    saying Fitzgerad’s “professional experience was seamless and well-considered before
    she met Desmond; it starts to move again very efficiently in the very last years
    of his life.” True enough. But we have seen there was space for Fitzgerald to
    be creative. And to blame Desmond is to take a straightforward view of complicated
    things. Many lives were affected by the war. As Penelope said, in a very different
    context, “nothing is ever all anybody’s fault.” It would also be misleading to
    say that Desmond was entirely a burden to Penelope. After he died, she wrote to
    a friend, “the truth is I was spoilt, as with all our ups and downs Desmond always
    thought everything I did was right.” She wrote later to the same friend: “I really
    don’t see how one can do without a family.” Talking to the *Guardian* in 1998
    she said, “The sort of men I like are life’s losers. They struggle gallantly,
    but they really ought to be left in peace.” If she did make a choice between her
    family and her art, however conscious, however much choice she really had, she
    didn’t entirely regret it. These were partly years of impediment, partly, as her
    son-in-law says, “The years when, as Cervantes said to explain his own long silence,
    she was living her life.”'

    Library and was woken up by the man sitting next to her. In 1977, the year Desmond
    died, she wrote to a friend, “I think we middle-class ladies are really driving
    ourselves mad by doing all the things that were formally done by a ‘staff’ and
    keeping up our cultural interests as well — tho’ there you are, we can’t help
    it. But when I lived in the council flat I noticed the other ladies seemed to
    have time to stand on their doorsteps and talk to each other all day, and I thought
    they managed better than I did.” There is a clear image of a woman struggling
    under the many demands of her life here; but also of a woman with time, space,

    Unable to write any other way, “a woman, in my experience, can pick up her draft
    novel and go on with it, precisely until the telephone, the doorbell, the egg
    timer, or the alarm rings.” She compared this to the way Napoleon could nap for
    ten minutes exactly. This wasn’t something she was happy about — she was by no
    means romanticising the realities of women’s lives. But she said that once she
    left teaching she missed the staff room “full of undercurrents of exhaustion,

    — she arrived at literature; she wasn’t entirely diverted from it. As late as
    1981, when she had written four novels, she wrote to her editor Richard Ollard
    that she had been asked to look at William Morris’ novel and “a mysterious chestful
    of Pre-Raphaelite papers” as well as having her (ultimately never published) work
    on the Poetry Bookshop to keep her busy. “Perhaps I’m better employed doing this…
    than in writing novels,” she muses. A response, no doubt, to the slow sales of
    *Human Voices* that year (she was never a very fashionable novelist in the time
    of Martin Amis) and a coy way of sounding out his support for her work, but telling
    nonetheless. She had won the Booker Prize at this point. (Stuart Proffit points
    out that Penelope was the last person to win the Booker before it was televised.
    “It didn’t have the transformative effect it does now. It was hard for her when

    Victorian sympathy and her preference for the Georgian poets over the Bloomsbury
    writers (despite her admiration for modernism, especially the novels of Beckett
    and Joyce), did not just inform her biography of Burne-Jones; it recurs in *The
    Beginning of Spring*. That novel was informed by a package holiday she took to
    Moscow in 1975, after years of studying Russian, involving many events — “lectures,
    films, theatres, exhibitions” — with the Great Britain-USSR Association. Similarly,
    in 1979, when Desmond was ill and she felt resentful of him, believing no-one
    cared about the publication of *Burne-Jones*, she went to Florence on her own,
    a visit that would re-emerge nearly a decade later in her novel *Innocence*. She
    also studied Spanish, German, and Chinese, visited Venice, Germany, Elba, Turkey,
    Madrid, Greece, and other countries. Her letters mention studying Spanish grammar
    at night. She was studying Russian at a similar period. So esoteric was the influence
    of this cultural immersion that when she based *Human Voices* on a poem by Heine
    (indicated by the name Asra and the reference in the novel to Asra being the name
    of a tribe) no critic noticed it, as she predicted. She asked the novelist A.S.

    precise and attentive reader of literature, and her work at the two colleges where
    she taught aspiring Oxbridge students meant she had to re-read the canon of English
    Literature with an inquiring eye and life-wearied imagination. As one of her pupils
    recalled, “she taught literature like a novelist, always the text back to the
    stuff of experience and getting us to look at *how it was being done*.” This constituted
    an apprenticeship for Fitzgerald, who made detailed annotations in her teaching
    books. There is tentative evidence that she was not undertaking her intensive
    self-education out of sheer curiosity. One of her notes on an exam paper with
    the question ‘Should there be limits to curiosity?” reads, “Scarcely an adult
    quality in itself — what is it an element of? Ambitious search for truth etc in
    biography.” In her restless pursuit of the truth about literature and history,
    she was laying the foundations for her fiction. The dialogue between Vladimir
    and Estragon in *Waiting for Godot* is marked as being between mind and body,
    which Lee links to the later fiction, especially *The Gate of Angels*. Of *Middlemarch*,
    Fitzgerald says, “low-keyed emotions but minutely traced” and “the characters’
    prospects narrow as the novel closes.” (Penelope used that last note in her  Introduction
    to *Middlemarch*, some twenty years later.) Both of these could be comments on
    Fitzgerald’s own technique. She often shows sympathy or keenness for minor characters,
    ordinary people, the overlooked — the ones she would write about. She started
    off with little enthusiasm for George Eliot and ended by admiring her hugely.

    as of *Punch* (“an important paper in its day, has been reduced to nothing.”)
    Years after she published it, she said to her editor, “Even while I was writing

    I wanted to leave a record of it before it was too late.” By the end of the year,

    was to find out about them, and by that time it was almost too late.” When she
    came back into sympathy with her uncles, she did so in a fairly serious way: “in
    so far as the world disagrees with them, I disagree with the world.” Far from
    being inhibited from pursuing this work earlier in her life, she had to go away
    and come back before she was able to contemplate it properly: “I count a violent

    with Penelope who married Desmond in 1942 when he was a dashing young Guards officer.
    But she is the first in a series of women characters who fall in love with men
    with significant failings. Fitzgerald writes these men to be understood, not judged.
    “You’ve no idea about others, and you don’t notice what makes them suffer,” Annie
    tells Sam, in a line that wouldn’t be out of place in *Offshore*, a novel much
    more closely modelled on the Fitzgerald’s marriage. Annie and Sam leave the BBC
    together and meet a utopian crank called Willie, who tells them, “a good society
    transforms its members.” There’s a good deal of Penelope’s Church of England Liberalism
    in that sentiment. Like Penelope, Annie is a young woman of the arts, somewhat
    adrift in wartime London, who finds an unlikely husband; as with so many of her
    characters, we feel slightly weary of their happiness at the end, not least because
    of the omen of Sam’s colleague Jeff leaving the BBC building to go and meet them
    only to be killed when he mistakes a taxi for an unexploded bomb.

    lurks in that novel. In the opening, when deciding what to do with an inheritance
    from her husband, Florence “had recently come to wonder whether she hadn’t a duty
    to make it clear to herself, and possibly to others, that she existed in her own
    right.” This isn’t literally Penelope — but she too was a recent widow and had
    reason to understand and write about such people. Here again she evokes a lost
    England, and something of a lost self: Müllers, a bookshop on Wigmore Street,
    closes after many years, which Florence takes “as a personal attack on her memories.”
    Penelope, too, had worked in a bookshop. And Florence has changed her life mid-way
    on the wave, just as Penelope was doing. “It is a peculiar thing to take a step
    forward in middle age, but having done it I don’t intend to retreat.” Indeed,
    the whole novel is about being a late bloomer, about “that precious sense of beginning
    again which she could not expect too often at her age.”'

    uselessness of feeling ashamed.” In *Human Voices* Annie’s father’s friends say,
    “We’re never sent more than we can bear.” And, “You begin life helpless and you
    end life helpless.” It took a novelist who had lived through what Fitzgerald had
    lived through to write these books. Even when her books weren’t based on her own
    life, they were recreating this lost time, whether in England or other places.

    responsibility, writing began. She wrote to Hugh Lee the year she wrote *The Bookshop*,
    “I’m not quite sure why I have taken to writing either, but it’s better than weaving,
    hand-printing &c in that it represents a slight profit rather than a large loss

- en: The idea that Fitzgerald was prevented from writing earlier than she did gets
    expressed in many ways. It is a pervasive and persuasive idea. In her preface
    to the novels, Hermione Lee quotes Fitzgerald saying, after she won the Booker
    Prize, “I knew I was an outsider.” This gives the impression of someone who has
    finally made it, someone with a long-held sense of their potential, someone held
    back by the world. That’s probably true of Fitzgerald. And as Lee points out,
    many of her characters are outsiders. But what Fitzgerald actually said, in a
    letter to her friend Francis King, was “I know I was an outsider.” It’s a small
    difference, the shift from *knew* to *know*, but it changes the meaning quite
    significantly. In the letter where she says this, Fitzgerald wasn’t talking about
    anything long-term, any sense of herself she had nurtured over the years. She
    was acknowledging that she was a surprise choice for the prize and that she won
    because the judges were split. Her intuition was correct. Frank Kermode had written
    before the prize that Fitzgerald was “on the list to be eliminated”. Hilary Spurling,
    one of the judges, later wrote about how Fitzgerald was “everyone’s second choice”
    and won because of a judges’ dispute. “I know I was an outsider,” she said, meaning
    she knew how the prize committee worked. It was no sort of bigger commentary on
    her career.

    start as an outsider. Quite the contrary. Her father edited *Punch*. Her uncles
    and aunt were renowned cryptographers, writers, and priests. Both grandfathers
    were bishops (Manchester and Lincoln). Indeed, she was born in a Bishop’s Palace.
    After her girls boarding school, she went to the same Oxford college as her mother.
    There was something suffocating about this brilliant childhood, perhaps especially
    because her mother died when she was a teenager. It is easy to see the influence
    of Desmond on her later life, but it is sensible to ask, as James Wood did, whether
    “some Knoxian combination of insecurity and confidence held her back until she
    could be sure of avoiding public failure?” If so, it makes sense that she would
    dwell on the fact that she won the Booker Prize as an outsider, because in her
    words the judges “ruled out novels evidently written with one eye on film rights.”

    She asked her publisher Colin Haycraft if he was interested in taking more of
    her novels after *The Bookshop* and he seems to have said no, and in a rather
    dismissive manner. She wrote to him, entirely in good faith, saying she was taking
    his advice to get another publisher. She thanked him for giving her a start by
    publishing her novels, “I’m sure you were right in saying no-one else would have
    taken them.” Haycraft was upset by this, thinking her cunning and careerist. In
    fact she was taking advice from Francis King, who was appalled at her poor treatment
    from Haycraft. Haycraft wrote to her denying he had told her to go elsewhere or
    that he had said he disliked her work. He was upset at her sudden departure. Haycraft
    was mean and gossipy, but Fitzgerald lacked confidence and was apt, as she wrote
    to him, to take remarks too seriously. As Hensher says, “it was definitely a strange
    moment for the novelist to be convinced of her lack of success in the world.”

    She was firmly rejecting Haycraft’s muddled and overbearing treatment, refusing
    to be treated like a little old lady — but she was also bad at business, perhaps
    the result of her combination of firm independence and mild insecurity. She was
    an unworldly artist, uncomfortable with practicalities and necessities. One of
    her students remembered the way she talked about authors’ lives, especially the
    poet Yeats coming downstairs from his tower and saying, about his own children,
    “who are they?” She wasn’t quite that bad; but she was that sort of person. She
    was hugely earnest and absorbed in what mattered to her. Stuart Proffit remembered
    that she didn’t make small talk in any conventional way. “She wanted to know what
    you were doing and reading and she talked about her grandchildren in little asides.”
    He noted that she wasn't someone you could get to know easily—”she wasn’t a quick
    study”—but the people who did work with her became hugely devoted to her. She
    had an artist’s interest in, and detachment from, the world.

    novels. “Biographies and novels are the forms I can just about manage.” She told
    an interviewer that biography was easier than fiction, because of the research,
    whereas with fiction “you’re out on your own.” She moved to fiction because biography
    was hard, competitive work and she preferred being able to write dialogue. And
    in those early novels, she wrote from life. In *Human Voices*, “I never went away
    from the truth.” In *At Freddies* “all the characters are taken straight from
    life.” The facts were transmogrified sometimes — she had to help two people having
    epiletic fits when she worked at the BBC; in the novel, this became a woman giving
    birth. But often, the novels hew closely to reality. The poltergeist in *The Bookshop*
    was entirely real to her experience. So she was not quite out on her own: she

    when she began to write fiction about the facts of other times and places.” Even
    in those last four novels, we see personal experience seeping through. *Innocence*
    has a character described as a dwarf. During a holiday to Elba, some twenty years
    before she wrote *Innocence*, Penelope took her first trip to Florence. In a letter
    about that holiday she described a member of the hotel staff as “a dwarf, only
    3 ft high.” *The Gate of Angels* is about a young man in Cambridge at the start
    of the twentieth century who meets his future wife when he has a bicycling accident.
    This was surely inspired by a puncture her uncle Ronald Knox once had at Cambridge
    in 1908, which he had to repair at a country Vicarage. No addresses were exchanged
    with the vicar’s daughters. Despite this, and despite the fact they were not “extremely
    beautiful” and that once one of them was engaged, “who shall say it was not a
    romance,” wrote the young Ronald, “because the threads were broken?” The threads
    were broken in *The Gate of Angels* too — but inspired by the way fiction can
    go beyond history, how it can let you see a life again in different terms, Penelope
    weaved those threads back together, albeit with an ambivalent sense of the future.

    trends and evolutions in response to James’ work. Not so the literary Holmes.
