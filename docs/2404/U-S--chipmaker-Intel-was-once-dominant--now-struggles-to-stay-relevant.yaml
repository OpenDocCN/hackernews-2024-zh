- en: The U.S. government is subsidizing a massive Intel fab outside of Columbus,
    Ohio, as part of $8.5 billion in loans and grants toward U.S. chipmaking. Gelsinger
    said last month that the plant will offer leading-edge manufacturing when it comes
    online in 2028, and will make AI chips — perhaps those of Intel's rivals, Gelsinger
    [said on a call with reporters in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html).

- en: Now, the march is starting to reach its destination, and Intel said on Thursday
    that it's still on track to catch up by 2026\. At that point, TSMC will be shipping
    2nm chips. Intel said it will begin producing its "18A" process, equivalent to
    2nm, by 2025.

- en: It hasn't been cheap, either. Intel reported a $2.5 billion operating loss in
    its foundry division on $4.4 billion in mostly internal sales. The sums represent
    the vast investments Intel is making in facilities and tools to make more advanced
    chips.
