    inflation out Wednesday shows them up 22% compared to last year. Since the end
    of 2019 — just before Covid hit — they’re up 45%.

- en: In a [prophylactic press release released Wednesday morning](https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9219951-american-property-casualty-insurance-association-auto-insurance-costs/),
    an insurance industry trade group cited “greatly increased the cost of repairing
    and replacing cars” due to inflation. As anyone who has shopped for a new or used
    car over the last couple years can tell you, costs have gone up. That goes for
    the costs of replacing minor parts like bumpers or mirrors as well.

- en: Insurers lost a lot of money on those replacement costs in 2021 and 2022, and
    are now trying to make that money back by raising rates a lot.

    Even before the pandemic, Americans were awful drivers compared to other high
    income countries, with auto death rates [the highest among peer nations](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7126a1.htm).
    High accident rates are reflected in higher costs of insurance.

    to make money and raising rates is the way to do it.

    that are not yet at target margins,” Jesse Merten, chief financial officer at
    Allstate told an investor conference in early March. “And in other states, we'll
    take rate to keep pace with increases in loss costs.”

    auto insurers such as Allstate and Progressive, are hovering near all-time highs,
    and are handily outpacing the market this year, rising about 21% and 29%, compared
    to the 8% gain in the S&P 500\.
