    business still in private hands, with a current valuation of about [$65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/28/fintech-giant-stripe-valuation-spikes-65b-employee-stock-sale/)
    and[ a whopping $1 trillion](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/13/stripes-growth-payment-1t-fintech/)
    in total processed payment volume last year alone. But fintech is fragmented and
    a fast-moving target, and with competitors chipping away at its place, Stripe
    is changing up its approach.

- en: Today, Stripe announced that it will be de-coupling payments — the jewel in
    its crown — from the rest of its financial services stack. This is a big change,
    considering that in the past, even as Stripe grew its list of services, it required
    businesses to be payments customers in order to use any of the rest. Alongside
    this, the company is adding in a number of new embedded finance features and a
    new wave of AI tools.

    where the company said it would be announcing more than 50 (yes, 50) new features
    on its platform, part of a slate of more than 250 (yes, 250) that have been announced
    so far this year.

    items is actually on the incremental side — updates and new features to bigger
    products already announced.

    to the needs of the most sophisticated and innovative businesses in the world,”
    said Patrick Collison, the CEO and co-founder of the company, at the event. “This
    year, because of our scale, Stripe is well positioned to help our users deal with
    the increasingly complex payments landscape and put AI to work to drive growth.
    We’re also making Stripe more modular, so companies can use just the parts of
    Stripe most useful to them.”

- en: 'Stripe removing its requirement to use its payments API addresses a major piece
    of friction for customers and would-be customers who might have wanted to use
    some of the company’s other tools — which include the likes of fraud, risk and
    verification services, billing and invoicing, in-person payments, financial account
    data, and more — but did not want to be all in on Stripe’s larger platform. It
    signifies a shift in how Stripe views its wider platform: In the past it took
    the approach that the launch of other services could help lure users to taking
    its payment services; now it appears to be willing to explore how it can sell
    some of those other, non-payments services on their own.'

    admitted that users had been asking the company to open up its walled garden for
    some time, but he claimed that one of the main reasons why it delayed doing so
    until now was due to it being technically hard to create integrations for legacy
    services.

    like Stripe (and many others like Adyen) have taken a platform approach to the
    business of payments services. They aim for bigger revenues and margins per customer
    by becoming one-stop shops. But the truth is that the market is huge and fragmented,
    and customers of all sizes have dozens, sometimes hundreds, of options for what
    to use.'

    be locked into contracts, and some may simply want to work with multiple providers
    depending on the market in question, or to de-risk by using multiple platforms.
    That has clearly started to become a bigger opportunity for the company; hence
    opening up its walled garden now.

    AI to give a more precise selection of payment options to customers depending
    on location and what customers may have already used. To fuel the personalization,
    it’s doubling the number of payment methods to 100\. They include the likes of
    Amazon Pay, Revolut Pay, Swish, Twint, and Zip.

    if you want us to go all in on Stripe,” Gaybrick said. OpenAI (which is also one
    of Stripe’s AI partners), Slack and River Island are among Stripe’s customers
    for this service.

    market trends, where we are seeing AI tooling being added into a number of fraud
    detection services. In its case, it’s launching a new tool called “Radar Assistant,”
    which lets users create new fraud tools on its Radar risk platform using natural
    language commands.

- en: Embedded finance — which involves companies, which may or may not be focusing
    on financial services, integrating financial products into their apps and other
    services to improve customer loyalty, revenues and experience — has become a growing
    area in fintech, with companies like Rapyd, Plaid, Airwallex and TrueLayer among
    the dozens of companies building and provisioning these tools to neobanks, other
    fintechs and others. Given that many “as a service” offerings also offer payments,
    it’s important that Stripe continue to build out its own embedded finance efforts,
    branded Stripe Connect, to remain competitive.

- en: Today it announced a number of upgrades to bring the total number of Connect
    tools to 17, including 10 focused on different payments services. These include,
    for example, adding in Stripe Capital to offer loans to customers, it said. Gaybrick
    told TechCrunch that Lightspeed, the point-of-sale company, makes 50% of its revenues
    now from embedded finance products, so it’s an important area for Stripe to keep
    developing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stripe has, frankly speaking, been somewhat slow on building out more sophisticated
    subscription and billing products, opening the door for companies like Paddle
    and more recent arrivals like Lago (which focuses on open sourced billing) to
    create significantly more nuanced offerings to address the wave of new technology
    and pricing for that tech in the market. These range not just to more granular
    and customizable subscription models, but also the introduction of usage-based
    billing, based on whatever parameters that customers want to create. Now Stripe
    is also throwing its hat into that game. Anthropic is a high-profile customer
    using various billing tools from Stripe to tailor how it charges and bills for
    its API. However it’s not (yet) adopting usage-based billing, the company said.

    we use Stripe Invoicing to make it easy to automate accounts receivable, collect
    payments, and reconcile transactions. This improves the experience for Anthropic
    and our customers alike,” said Daniela Amodei, co-founder and president of Anthropic,
    in a statement.
