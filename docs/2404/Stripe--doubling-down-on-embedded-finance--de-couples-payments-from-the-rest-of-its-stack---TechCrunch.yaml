- en: Today, Stripe announced that it will be de-coupling payments — the jewel in
    its crown — from the rest of its financial services stack. This is a big change,
    considering that in the past, even as Stripe grew its list of services, it required
    businesses to be payments customers in order to use any of the rest. Alongside
    this, the company is adding in a number of new embedded finance features and a
    new wave of AI tools.

    of friction for customers and would-be customers who might have wanted to use
    some of the company’s other tools — which include the likes of fraud, risk and
    verification services, billing and invoicing, in-person payments, financial account
    data, and more — but did not want to be all in on Stripe’s larger platform. It
    signifies a shift in how Stripe views its wider platform: In the past it took
    the approach that the launch of other services could help lure users to taking
    its payment services; now it appears to be willing to explore how it can sell
    some of those other, non-payments services on their own.'

- en: In an interview, Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of product and business,
    admitted that users had been asking the company to open up its walled garden for
    some time, but he claimed that one of the main reasons why it delayed doing so

    like Stripe (and many others like Adyen) have taken a platform approach to the
    business of payments services. They aim for bigger revenues and margins per customer

- en: Indeed, some will want to have the freedom to be flexible, and some might well
    be locked into contracts, and some may simply want to work with multiple providers
    depending on the market in question, or to de-risk by using multiple platforms.

    subscription and billing products, opening the door for companies like Paddle
    and more recent arrivals like Lago (which focuses on open sourced billing) to
    create significantly more nuanced offerings to address the wave of new technology
    and pricing for that tech in the market. These range not just to more granular
    and customizable subscription models, but also the introduction of usage-based
    billing, based on whatever parameters that customers want to create. Now Stripe
    is also throwing its hat into that game. Anthropic is a high-profile customer
    using various billing tools from Stripe to tailor how it charges and bills for
    its API. However it’s not (yet) adopting usage-based billing, the company said.
