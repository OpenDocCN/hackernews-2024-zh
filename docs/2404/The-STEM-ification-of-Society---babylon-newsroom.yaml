    resources from the resource-rich interior of the country to a port for extraction,
    in this case the city of Mombasa. Through economic domination, society was completely
    reconfigured for resource extraction. The methods of data appropriation in society
    today are not as overt; however, they too have resulted in the reconfiguration
    of our society and economy.'

- en: To extract our data, society must first be transformed in a way to make data
    itself a natural resource. Couldry and Mejias state that the availability of data
    has to be constructed “through an elaborate means of marketization”. The natural
    resource which results from our use of modern day technology is transformed through
    the *social quantification sector*, the companies which transform our data into
    usable tools. The reach of these entities knows no boundaries — every click on
    Facebook and Google, every second of video watched on YouTube, and every like
    on Instagram is appropriated from the user to feed the algorithm which drives
    the internal logic of these platforms. ChatGPT for example, is trained on data
    extracted from and generated by people like you and me.

    of applications you use everyday is severely limited.

    facto* factor of production under data capitalism. The new logic of a post-Marxian
    techno-capitalism is an economic process which transforms life processes — in
    this case interaction through technology and social networks — into commodities.
    Data colonialism opens a new frontier for Marxian labor alienation: the way in
    which labor, in this case our contribution to these platforms, distances us from
    our humanity. The outcome of these extractive processes is a platform which flips
    the relation between technology and user on its head - through product placements
    and gamification, *technology begins to use you.*'

    utilize increasingly complex algorithms which in turn require increasingly immense
    sources of data to make decisions which have vast repercussions for our daily
    lives. Financial markets rise and fall and policy is written based off complex
    processes of data extraction. *When our lives are expropriated, flattened, and
    slotted into databases, can we trust that our humanity is well-represented when
    making these decisions?*

- en: For this reason, I must reject Bogost’s assertion that computer scientists require
    a more well-rounded education to be stewards for the field. The problem is not
    computer science itself, rather the internal logic of datafication it advocates.
    A computer scientist working at Palantir with a high proficiency in a foreign
    language and an ethics course on their transcript will not stop using facial recognition
    technology to perpetuate racist policing practices.

  zh: 因此，我必须反对博戈斯特关于计算机科学家需要更全面教育才能成为该领域监护人的说法。问题不在于计算机科学本身，而在于其所倡导的数据化内在逻辑。一个在Palantir工作的计算机科学家，虽然精通外语并在他们的学术记录中有伦理课程，也不会停止使用面部识别技术来维持种族主义警务实践。
- en: Some of the richest and most powerful people today got their starts in technology.
    Beginning in the 1970s, computational science was inextricably tied to the military
    industrial complex. Tech billionaires may be individually eccentric, but their
    interests were always connected to American militarism. They have wielded their
    vast influence to fundamentally reshape society to benefit their project of data
    colonialism and financialization.

- en: 'Bogost, to his credit, raises an alarm — technology moves quickly, but it can
    also be reckless: “Someone [may] ask you to solve a problem, and you solve it
    without asking if it’s a problem worth solving.” In China, the highest decision-making
    bodies have been on a mission to solve problems with technology without interrogating
    the possible outcomes.'
