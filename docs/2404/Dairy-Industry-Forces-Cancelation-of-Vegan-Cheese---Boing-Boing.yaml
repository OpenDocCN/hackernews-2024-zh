    – it's the sour grapes emanating from the dairy industry as they try in vain to
    curdle the rise of a plant-based upstart that's threatening to spoil their future.

    Netflix documentary, *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/04/27/vegan-cheese-good-food-awards-climax/)*
    reports on scandal at the prestigious Good Food Awards. A plant-based blue cheese
    was selected as a finalist, shocking high-quality artisanal dairy-based cheesemakers
    who felt it didn't belong in the competition.

- en: After initially being named a finalist, Climax Blue cheese was later disqualified
    by the Good Food Foundation, reportedly due to issues around one of the ingredients
    (kokum butter) not having GRAS certification. But Climax CEO Oliver Zahn accused
    the foundation of caving to pressure from the dairy cheese industry and changing
    the rules after the fact to disqualify his product. The foundation denies this,
    saying it was due to a complaint from someone in the community.

    because the vegan cheese was so delicious that it had slated to win the overall
    competition before the Good Food Foundation caved to pressure.

    could make the argument that this is like a fraudulent cheese. As a cheesemaker,
    it's a fraud. It looks like a cheese. It might taste like a cheese. But it's not.
    It's not connected to our historical understanding of what cheeses are."

    centuries. When it comes down to it, he notes, plants fuel the animals that produce
    milk — and so in concocting a milk made out of plants, Zahn says he's just cutting
    out the middleman (or middle-bovine). In his analysis of traditional cheesemaking,
    a cow is essentially a processing machine — and not a very efficient one at that.

    and in the case of a cow, 90 percent of the inputs go to just processing," he
    says. "There is no factory you could potentially devise that would come with that
    much processing."'

    the spotlight have only served to amplify its rise, proving the old adage that
    the more you try to censor or suppress something, the more attention you inadvertently
    bring to it. Just like the Barbra Streisand effect, the panicked reaction of the
    traditional cheesemakers has guaranteed Climax Blue far more publicity and notoriety
    than it ever would have received by simply winning the Good Food Award outright.
