    invariably sets a target that can never be achieved, and one spec’s *up to* may
    be very different from another. I’m thinking here of Thunderbolt and USB4, both
    of which claim *up to* 40 Gb/s, but fail to achieve it in different ways, and
    with different types of Mac. To understand this, we need to read the fine print
    with care.

    and 4 offer up to 4 lanes of PCI Express 3.0 totalling 32.4 Gb/s for general-purpose
    data transfer, and 4 lanes of DisplayPort 1.4 HBR3 for video. So the fastest we
    can expect from an Intel Mac’s Thunderbolt ports is 32.4 Gb/s when transferring
    data with an external SSD. We know from long and sometimes bitter experience that
    means read and write speeds of up to 3 GB/s, often significantly less than that.
    So much for Thunderbolt’s *up to* 40 Gb/s.

    technically known as USB4 Gen 3×2, marketed as USB 40Gbps, with a nominal transfer
    rate of 40 Gb/s or up to 4.8 GB/s. Because of protocol overheads, in practice
    that means a suitably fast NVMe SSD should clock read and write speeds of well
    over 3 GB/s, possibly even towards 4 GB/s. That’s USB4’s *up to* 40 Gb/s.

    GB/s, while a suitable USB4 enclosure running from any Apple silicon Mac should
    comfortably exceed that if it really does support USB 40Gbps.

- en: Ready-made external SSDs and enclosures rely on different chips to deliver Thunderbolt
    and USB4 support, although few vendors go to the trouble of making this explicit.
    More expensive certified Thunderbolt models should use Intel chips, but some of
    those can’t manage up to 40 Gb/s, only up to 20 Gb/s. More recent hardware may
    opt instead for two chips, one to support Thunderbolt, the other for a consolation
    prize to those whose computers are stuck with some variant of USB 3.

- en: The latest may instead target USB4 at 40 Gb/s and fall back to USB 3.1 Gen 2
    when that isn’t available. Those therefore run at better than 3 GB/s with the
    USB4 support in Apple silicon Macs, but only 1 GB/s of USB 3 when connected to
    a port on an Intel Mac. The better vendors will make that clear when describing
    their products, but when you buy a brand with an ad hoc name that you’ve not seen
    before, you may not realise this until you connect the SSD to your Mac.

    hub? That will depend on which modes the hub can operate in, both to the enclosure
    and back to the Mac, although no hub that I’ve seen makes that clear.

    and 3.2 GB/s read speeds with a USB4 enclosure, confirming that it’s still exceeding
    the speeds of a directly connected Thunderbolt 3 SSD without USB4 support. Whether
    that’s also true of other recent “Thunderbolt 4” hubs, such as the CalDigit Element
    and Plugable Thunderbolt 4, I don’t know.

    changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen
    the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 *up to* 3 GB/s, even though few drives ever
    seemed capable of achieving that *up to.* If you’re still needing good performance
    with an Intel Mac, that makes sense.

    off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s Express 1M2, which
    should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much prefer
    the word *over* to *up to.*
