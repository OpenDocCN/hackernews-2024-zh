- en: Zilog has announced it is halting production of its standalone DIP-packaged
    Z80 CPU models ‚Äî a move that could spell trouble for vintage computing enthusiasts
    looking to build Z80-based systems or repair existing machines with new parts.

- en: Zilog launched the original eight-bit Z80 CPU in 1976 as its first product,
    designed by former Intel engineer and company co-founder Federico Faggin and early
    employee Masatoshi Shima. Designed to offer improvements over Intel's 8080 and
    built with embedded computing in mind, the Z80 quickly rose to become one of the
    most popular CPU choices for microcomputers ‚Äî going head-to-head with MOS Technology's
    rival 6502, launched a year earlier, and appearing in devices including the Sinclair
    ZX Spectrum, Tandy TRS-80, and Namco's Pac-Man arcade cabinets.

- en: Although a design of its era, the Z80 CPU is still a popular choice for both
    modern embedded systems and enthusiast gadgets longing for a nostalgic return
    to simpler times ‚Äî but it appears Zilog is finally calling time on the line, despite
    its status at one time as one of the mostly highly second-sourced CPU designs.

- en: In a product change notice issued by Zilog parent company Littelfuse this week,
    the company warned users that "our Wafer Foundry Manufacturer will be discontinuing
    support for the Z80 product and other product lines" ‚Äî with 14 June 2024 as the
    last-time-buy (LTB) date, after which the parts will no longer be available to
    order.

- en: The notification names 13 Z80 parts, all in the Z84C00 family, as being officially
    end-of-life ‚Äî including parts which are commonly used to replace faulty chips
    in vintage computers or to build Z80-powered modern machines inspired by same.
    The discontinuation does not, however, appear to cover the eZ80 embedded core
    range ‚Äî only the standalone CPU parts.

    [in the product notification PDF](https://www.mouser.com/PCN/Littelfuse_PCN_Z84C00.pdf);
    "depending on the overall LTB demand," Zilog warns, "minimum/maximum order quantities
    may be implemented."
