    houses made up 37 percent and 11 percent of the market share, according to the
    filing, and combined they would have condensed the Big Five publishing houses
    into the Big Four. But the government intervened and brought an antitrust case
    against Penguin to determine whether that would create a monopoly.

    the $2.2 billion purchase](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-permanent-injunction-blocking-penguin-random-house-s-proposed).
    But during the trial, the head of every major publishing house and literary agency
    got up on the stand to speak about the publishing industry and give numbers, giving
    us an eye-opening account of the industry from the inside. All of the transcripts
    from the trial were compiled into a book called *[The Trial](https://bookshop.org/a/2268/9781948586559)*.

    spend most of their money on book advances for big celebrities like Britney Spears
    and franchise authors like James Patterson and this is the bulk of their business.
    They also sell a lot of Bibles, repeat best sellers like *Lord of the Rings,*
    and children’s books like *The Very Hungry Caterpillar*. These two market categories
    (celebrity books and repeat bestsellers from the backlist) make up the entirety
    of the publishing industry and even fund their vanity project: publishing all
    the rest of the books we think about when we think about book publishing (which

    editors… Obviously, given the number of people searching on Amazon for products,
    that gives them a huge advantage because when people go onto Amazon, they—if the
    book isn’t there for what they are searching for, they could create that book.
    That’s one theory I have. But even if that doesn’t happen, they know what people
    are buying and they have access to that data. Their bestseller list, in my view,
    is more important than *The New York Times* best seller list because it’s in realtime.
    It’s hourly. And I look at that Amazon best seller list regularly, every day.

    to go straight to the internet and sell directly if you have a following… Colleen
    Hoover has published with both Amazon and Simon & Schuster. And her Amazon book
    was on the independent book sellers’ best seller list. So what that says to me
    is that a Rubicon has been crossed.

    mass-market book, like it is a trade paperback, but a smaller format. It has been
    declining for the last 25 years. But we had a step change around ’14, ‘15, with
