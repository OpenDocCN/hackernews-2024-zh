# Generative AI Has an Intellectual Property Problem

> 来源：[https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem](https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem)

 Generative AI, which uses data lakes and question snippets to recover patterns and relationships, is becoming more prevalent in creative industries. However, the legal implications of using generative AI are still unclear, particularly in relation to copyright infringement, ownership of AI-generated works, and unlicensed content in training data. Courts are currently trying to establish how intellectual property laws should be applied to generative AI, and several cases have already been filed. To protect themselves from these risks, companies that use generative AI need to ensure that they are in compliance with the law and take steps to mitigate potential risks, such as ensuring they use training data free from unlicensed content and developing ways to show provenance of generated content.
