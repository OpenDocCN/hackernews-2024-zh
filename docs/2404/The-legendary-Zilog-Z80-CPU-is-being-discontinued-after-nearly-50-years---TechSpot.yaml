- en: '**Why it matters:** Zilog is retiring the Z80 after 48 years on the market.
    Originally developed as a project stemming from the Intel 8080, it eventually
    rose to become one of the most popular and widely used 8-bit CPUs in both gaming
    and general computing devices.'

- en: The iconic IC device, developed by Federico Faggin, will soon be phased out,
    and interested parties only have a few months left to place their orders before
    Zilog's manufacturing partner ends support for the technology.

    Wafer Foundry Manufacturer (WFM) will cease accepting "last time buy" (LTB) orders
    for the remaining Z80 products in mid-June. Zilog will process and schedule LTB
    orders for the Z80 based on customers' demand, while WFM will provide actual delivery
    dates thereafter. Depending on the overall LTB demand, the company may impose
    stricter requirements on minimum and maximum quantities.

- en: Federico Faggin, an Intel engineer, founded Zilog in 1974 after his work on
    the Intel 4004, the first 4-bit CPU. The Zilog Z80 was then released in July 1976,
    conceived as a software-compatible "extension" and enhancement of the Intel 8080
    processor.

- en: Developed by a team of just 12 people, the Z80 saw remarkable success, leading
    Zilog to establish its own chip manufacturing plants and expand to over a thousand
    employees within two years. Like its Intel counterpart, the Z80 was originally
    designed for embedded systems but went on to become a significant milestone in
    gaming hardware from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.

- en: Several home computers and gaming consoles were built around the capabilities
    of the Z80, including Sega's Master System and SG-1000, and Nintendo's Game Boy
    and Game Boy Color. Many classic arcade games also used the Z80, including the
    original version of Pac-Man. Additionally, the 8-bit processor was common in military
    applications, musical synthesizers like the Roland Jupiter-8, and various other
    electronic devices.

- en: Zilog licensed its Z80 technology to US companies Synertek and Mostek, which
    aided Faggin's venture with production, as well as to the European manufacturer
    SGS/STMicroelectronics. The CPU design was later replicated by Japanese, East
    European, and Soviet manufacturers, while corporations such as NEC, Toshiba, Sharp,
    and Hitachi produced their own compatible versions of the chip.

    offering advanced microcontroller products that retain compatibility with the
    original Z80 and Z180 designs.
