    the Mellon Bank branch in Swissvale, a small suburb of Pittsburgh. One of them
    pointed a handgun at the teller, demanding cash. The teller, shaking with fear,
    handed over some money. The robbers ran out.

    nor to obscure their faces with masks. They looked straight into security cameras.
    This was particularly puzzling because Wheeler, five foot six and 270 pounds,
    had an easily identifiable physique—and a distinct face. Sure enough, his conspicuousness
    doomed him. The local news flashed a photo of Wheeler on the 11 o’clock news.
