    consultant firm Tyton Partners, sponsored by plagiarism detection platform Turnitin,
    found half of college students used AI tools in Fall 2023\. Meanwhile, while fewer
    faculty members used AI, the percentage grew to 22% of faculty members in the
    fall of 2023, up from 9% in spring 2023.

    AI for schoolwork, many do not have guidelines for teachers. The practice of using
    AI for writing feedback or grading assignments also raises ethical considerations.
    And parents and students who are already spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
    on tuition may wonder if an endless feedback loop of AI-generated and AI-graded
    content in college is worth the time and money.

- en: How teachers use AI depends on many factors, particularly when it comes to grading,
    according to Dorothy Leidner, a professor of business ethics at theUniversity
    of Virginia. If the material being tested in a large class is largely declarative
    knowledge — so there is a clear right and wrong — then a teacher grading using
    the AI “might be even superior to human grading,” she told CNN.

    definitive answers, grading should remain personalized so teachers can provide
    more specific feedback and get to know a student’s work, and, therefore, progress
    over time.

    language use and grammar — and give a numerical score on those figures. But teachers
    should then grade students’ work themselves when looking for novelty, creativity
    and depth of insight.

    and potentially a breach of their intellectual property. AI tools like ChatGPT

    boast plagiarism detection tools tohelp teachers identify when assignments are
    written by ChatGPT and other AI. But these types of detection tools are far from
    foolproof; OpenAI shut down its own AI-detection tool last year due to what the
    company called a “low rate of accuracy.”
