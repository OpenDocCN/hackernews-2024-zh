    chips](https://qz.com/nvidia-gtc-conference-highlights-jensen-huang-ai-chip-1851356673)
    is [now available to developers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/whats-new-with-google-clouds-ai-hypercomputer-architecture)
    — and took a shot at Microsoft and Amazon, too.

- en: The tech giant’s latest AI chip, the Cloud TPU v5p, [was first announced in
    December](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-cloud-tpu-v5p-and-ai-hypercomputer),
    the same day as its chatbot Gemini. The new TPU, or tensor processing unit, can
    train large language models almost three times faster than its predecessor, Google’s
    TPU v4, the company said. Large language models (LLMs) power AI chatbots like
    ChatGPT.

    [Nvidia](https://qz.com/nvidia-history-origin-ai-chip-jensen-huang-1851372906)
    is the main supplier of the AI chips known as GPUs, or graphics processing units.
    And Google parent Alphabet is one of Nvidia’s biggest customers, behind Microsoft
    and Facebook parent Meta.

    post announcing its latest AI chip, Google mentioned Nvidia 20 times. Right under
    its detailing of the TPU v5p, the company said it’s updating its A3 supercomputer,
    which runs on Nvidia GPUs. And Google reminded customers that it’s using [Nvidia’s
    latest chip, the Blackwell](https://qz.com/nvidia-new-blackwell-ai-chip-1851348043),
    in its AI Hypercomputer.

    flashier presentation of its new, [Arm-based central processing unit called Google
    Axion](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu).
    In a game show-esque reveal, Kurian walked the stage during his keynote address
    with the Axion in hand, flashing the chip to applause.

- en: Google Axion is a new rival to the CPUs of Microsoft and Amazon, which have
    already made their own Arm-based computing chips. The British tech company Arm
    licenses its chip infrastructure design for *actual* chip manufacturers to build
    upon. Google’s release of Axion marks the first time the company has used Arm’s
    chip infrastructure for a CPU.

    Arm-based instances available in the cloud today” and “up to 50% better performance
    and up to 60% better energy-efficiency” than other general purpose Arm chips.

- en: Google customers can use Axion on its cloud services, which basically means
    those users would be opting to run their cloud services on a more efficient computer
    processor in Google’s physical data centers. [Google also told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-unveils-arm-based-data-center-processor-new-ai-chip-2024-04-09/)
    that “customers using Arm anywhere can easily adopt Axion without re-architecting
    or re-writing their apps.”
