- en: The shutdown timing was mainly technical. There have been enough infrastructure
    changes that the Reader codebase has rotted, and it cannot be pushed to prod anymore.
    It sounded like there hadn't been any pushes for ~6 months. I'm pretty I pushed
    shortly before I left (October 2012), so it's a bit surprising that the code rotted
    that quickly.

  zh: 停止服务的时间主要是技术原因。已经有足够多的基础设施更改，使得读者的代码库已经老化，不能再推送到生产环境了。听起来大概已经有6个月没有推送了。我离开前（2012年10月）我记得我稍微推送了一下，所以代码老化得这么快有点令人惊讶。
- en: The shutdown is mainly being handled by the SREs (Alan will actually be on vacation
    for the two weeks before July 1). It effectively sounded like they were going
    to be removing the GFE rules on July 1, and then take their time actually turning
    off any servers, since that actually involves understanding how things work and
    what depends on what. The FRBEs will definitely be running for a while longer,
    since there are other Google services that depend on them.

  zh: 关闭主要由SREs处理（Alan实际上会在7月1日前的两周休假）。听起来他们将在7月1日移除GFE规则，然后慢慢地关闭服务器，因为这涉及理解工作原理及其相互依赖关系。FRBEs肯定会运行更长一段时间，因为还有其他Google服务依赖于它们。
- en: All of the feed data is going to be given to the Feeds team in Zurich (they
    also inherited the PubSubHubbub hub and maybe even the AJAX Feed API). They will
    hopefully archive it. Matt Cutts has been part of the cabal that has been trying
    to make the shutdown be handled as reasonably as possible.

  zh: 所有的反馈数据将交给苏黎世的Feeds团队（他们还继承了PubSubHubbub Hub甚至可能是AJAX Feed API）。他们希望能够对其进行归档。Matt
    Cutts一直是试图让关闭尽可能合理处理的阴谋集团的一部分。
- en: He said politics didn't really factor into it. If it had been politics, the
    easiest thing would have been to do nothing, and let the service run as is idefinitely.
    Wipeout (Reader is not compliant, data for deleted Gaia accounts is still present)
    was a slight factor, but if that had been the only reason, it still would have
    been easier to let it keep running.

  zh: 他说政治实际上并没有起到作用。如果是政治因素的话，最简单的事情是什么也不做，让服务无限期地运行下去。清除（读者不兼容，已删除的Gaia帐户数据仍然存在）是一个轻微的因素，但如果这是唯一的原因，仍然让它继续运行会更容易。
- en: Once the shutdown decision was made, they needed to put someone's name on the
    blog posts (Google Blog, Reader Blog). Alan said he was OK with his name being
    on the Reader Blog, since he was the last engineer standing. However, it didn't
    make sense for this name (as a random engineer) to be on a Google Blog post that
    announced the shutting down of several services. It made more sense for a VP,
    or at least a director. PR asked several directors and VPs (including Alan Noble,
    the SYD site director), and they all begged off, saying that they had (external)
    people they were going to be meeting in the next couple of weeks, and if their
    name was on the blog post, they would just get a lot of hate about shutting down
    Reader. PR then asked Alan, and after thinking about it, he declined. PR thanked
    him for seriously considering it, and then went to Alan's manager and asked him
    to ask Alan. Alan declined again. PR asked his manager to ask him again, and Alan
    said he would only do it if they promoted him to director, and that was the last
    that he heard of it. Eventually Urs said he would be OK with putting his name
    on it. Alan seemed to have a pretty good opinion of Urs; that of all the VPs he
    was most willing to speak truthfully about Reader.

  zh: 一旦决定关闭，他们需要在博客文章（Google Blog, Reader Blog）上署名。Alan 表示他可以在 Reader Blog 上署名，因为他是最后一位留下的工程师。然而，在宣布关闭多项服务的
    Google Blog 文章上，随意选择一个工程师的名字是没有意义的。至少需要一个副总裁或者一个主管的名字更合适。公关部询问了几位主管和副总裁（包括 SYD
    站点主管 Alan Noble），他们都推辞了，表示接下来几周他们将会见一些外部人士，如果他们的名字出现在博客文章中，他们会因为关闭 Reader 而遭到很多抨击。公关部后来询问了
    Alan，经过考虑，他拒绝了。公关部感谢他认真考虑，然后去找 Alan 的经理，让他问 Alan。Alan 再次拒绝了。公关部又让他的经理再问一次，Alan
    表示只有在他们晋升他为主管时才会考虑。这件事就此搁置。最后，Urs 表示他可以在博客文章上签名。Alan 对 Urs 的看法似乎不错；在所有副总裁中，他似乎是最愿意真诚地谈论
    Reader 的。
- en: PR also gave Alan a document for posting to reader-discuss@ and internal Google+.
    It was apparently terrible, but he was at least allowed to rewrite it. In general
    it sounded like PR is now very involved in internal communications; Alan sounded
    rather cynical about that.

  zh: 公关部还给了 Alan 一份在 reader-discuss@ 和内部 Google+ 发布的文件。显然这份文件很糟糕，但他至少被允许重新写。总的来说，看起来公关部现在在内部沟通中非常活跃；Alan
    对此显得相当愤世嫉俗。
- en: The blog post announcing the shutdown was done one day early. The idea was to
    take the opportunity of the new Pope being announced and Andy Rubin being replaced
    as head of Android, so that the Reader news may be drowned out. PR didn't apparently
    realize that the kinds of people that care about the other two events (especially
    the Pope) are not the same kind of people that care about Reader, so it didn't
    work.

  zh: 宣布关闭的博客文章提前了一天发布。他们计划利用新教皇的宣布和 Andy Rubin 被换掉 Android 负责人的机会，以便 Reader 的消息可能会被淹没。公关部显然没有意识到关心其他两件事件（特别是教皇）的人群与关心
    Reader 的人群不同，所以并没有起到作用。
- en: This also screwed up the internal announcement plans. The idea had been to announce
    the management reshuffle on Tuesday, have a town hall about it Wednesday morning,
    and then announce the Reader shutdown on Wednesday afternoon, leaving TGIF (now
    on Thursdays) as the venue to discuss it. Since it all happened on Tuesday, the
    townhall ended up being dominated with Reader questions. They continued at TGIF,
    to the point where Sergey held up a microphone cable and said “If I bite down
    on this, will the pain stop?” Urs was the only VP who had decent answers to the
    Reader questions (Matt Cutts in particular spoke for a while defending Reader).
    About a month (?) later, there was a “bring your parent(s) to work day”, at which
    they held a special TGIF in Shoreline Amphitheatre. Parents were apparently encouraged
    to ask questions, and the first parent asked about the Reader shutdown, which
    elicited a lot of laughter from all the Googlers.

  zh: 这也打乱了内部公告计划。原本的计划是周二宣布管理层重组，周三上午举行全体员工大会，并在周三下午宣布关闭 Reader，留下 TGIF（现在在周四）的时间讨论此事。由于一切发生在周二，全体员工大会最终被
    Reader 的问题主导。在 TGIF 上继续讨论，甚至 Sergey 拿起一个麦克风电缆说：“如果我咬住这个，痛苦会停止吗？” Urs 是唯一一个能够给出合理答案的副总裁（特别是
    Matt Cutts 辩护 Reader 一段时间）。大约一个月后，在谷歌举行了“带你的父母来上班日”，在 Shoreline Amphitheatre 举行了一个特别的
    TGIF。显然鼓励父母提问，第一个父母问到 Reader 关闭的问题，引起了所有谷歌员工的大笑。
