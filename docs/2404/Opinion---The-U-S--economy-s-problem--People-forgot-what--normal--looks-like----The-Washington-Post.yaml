- en: It has been a miracle year for the U.S. economy. Inflation has plummeted without
    triggering a recession. Many [experts said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/13/larry-summers-biden-inflation-projections/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2)
    that could not happen without widespread layoffs and a downturn. The economy has
    [gained 2.4 million jobs](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) so far this
    year, and growth has accelerated, with an annualized rate [topping 5 percent](https://www.bea.gov/news/2023/gross-domestic-product-second-estimate-corporate-profits-preliminary-estimate-third)
    in the third quarter. The good news has also fueled a [stock market rally](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/premarket-stocks-markets-2024/index.html#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20currently%20sits,was%20reached%20in%20January%202022).).
    In polls, people are [downbeat about this economy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/10/22/biden-s-economy-is-great-everywhere-except-in-the-polls/d6bae722-70d6-11ee-936d-7a16ee667359_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_2),
    but their actions don’t match their words. There has been a [consumption boom](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/upshot/economy-voters-poll.html)
    this year. Americans continued to spend heavily on apparel, concerts and vacations.
    In many ways, this is the year the economy finally returned to something close
    to normal. But many people seem to have forgotten what normal looks like after
    a traumatic few years.

  zh: 美国经济今年是一个奇迹般的一年。通胀率大幅下降，而没有引发经济衰退。许多[专家说](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/13/larry-summers-biden-inflation-projections/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2)这种情况不可能发生，除非普遍裁员和经济衰退。截至目前，今年已经新增了240万个工作岗位，经济增长加快，第三季度年化增长率超过5%。这些好消息也推动了[股市的反弹](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/investing/premarket-stocks-markets-2024/index.html#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20currently%20sits,was%20reached%20in%20January%202022)。民意调查显示，人们对当前经济持悲观态度，但他们的行动却与言辞不符。今年出现了[消费热潮](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/upshot/economy-voters-poll.html)，美国人继续大量消费服装、音乐会和度假。从多个方面来看，今年经济终于回归到接近正常状态。但许多人似乎已经忘记了经历了几年的创伤之后正常的模样。
