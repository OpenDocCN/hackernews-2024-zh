    work with that, instead of manipulating the curves directly. In this blog post
    I will present three easy ways to convert quadratics, cubics, and elliptical arcs
    to a sequence of line segments. These line segments make it almost trivial to
    solve problems like computing the [arc length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/pathLength)
    or [dash offset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dashoffset).
    They can also simplify the process of rendering the curves if you have a renderer
    that can already handle paths enclosed by polylines, which is much easier to implement
    compared to rendering the curves directly. If you want an introduction to Bézier
    curves in general check out [A Primer on Bézier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/)
    or [The Beauty of Bézier Curves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw).

    for curve flattening when I was working with a vector renderer on a microcontroller.
    The default implementation was using way too much memory: it generated a ton of
    lines and stored them all in an array. For every single curve, there would be
    hundreds of lines stored, which is a lot more than what I could afford - customers
    would run out of memory even for very basic scenes. Not to mention the whole process
    was slow as hell too.'

    In there, a whopping 256 lines are generated for every quadratic/cubic Bézier
    curve, and the same applies to arcs too. OpenVG-RI simply samples the curves at
    uniformly-distributed values for \(t\) and generates lines from there. Proof:

    Being a reference implementation, it’s of course expected not to be some kind
    of efficient method. It’s more focused on getting things rendered *correctly*,
    rather than efficiently.'

    in which a De Casteljau subdivision is used. The consequence of the recursive
    nature of the De Casteljau subdivision is that you don’t know in advance how many
    segments it will generate, and computing those segments is not an independent
    process. You have to store the \(t\) values somehow, and only after that can you
    process them.

    value, which I have named \(\varepsilon\). Keep in mind that for demonstration
    purposes the curve is actually stroked using the generated lines, which makes
    it look worse than if you would use them to render filled paths. In reality the
    quality is great even when the tolerance is set to 0.25\. [Here’s](/glyph_36_smart_subdivision_test.png)
    one example of the `@` glyph rendered with the tolerance set to 0.25 (all curves
    of the glyph are quadratics). In my opinion it looks more than good enough.

    way that all its points are collinear and the end point is between the start point
    and control point, then a straight line between the start and end point will be
    drawn. That happens no matter what the tolerance is set to, and it’s not really
    correct. A quick workaround for this is to check when only one segment is generated,
    compute the \(t\) value where the derivative of the quadratic is 0, and use that
    to generate two or three segments. This workaround is still not entirely accurate
    but gives a good estimate in most cases. If you need more accuracy, you can use
    the traditional recursive method. It won’t be expensive as there will be at most
    4 or 5 segments generated even with a very small tolerance.'

    The code is simple too. If you want to see the code for all the solutions in this
    blog post, you can do that [here](/flattening-bezier-curves-and-arcs.js). Keep
    in mind that for each of the presented methods it’s entirely possible to create
    an iterator that will compute lines on demand, without any extra memory. I store
    them in arrays for simplicity’s sake. You could write it all as one big `fold`
    if you wanted to.

    works if the cubic is sufficiently close to being a quadratic. Since we are doing
