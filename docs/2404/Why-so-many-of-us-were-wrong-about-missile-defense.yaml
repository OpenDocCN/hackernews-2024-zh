    against Israel, in retaliation for Israel killing one of Iran’s military commanders.
    The attack included about 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles.
    But something pretty incredible happened — almost all of the drones and missiles
    were shot down before they could hit Israel, by a combination of Israeli, U.S.,
    Jordanian, French, British, and possibly Saudi forces. Only a few ballistic missiles
    made it through, wounding one Arab Israeli girl severely and causing minor injuries
    to a few other people.

    from far more important matters in East Asia, and we should keep our role to a
    minimum. The Gaza war has not fundamentally altered the balance of power in the
    Middle East; Israel and the Sunni powers are unofficial and uneasy partners against
    Iran and its proxies. Both sides are pretty brutal, and neither looks likely to
    dominate the other. U.S. resources and attention are far better spent elsewhere.

- en: Now, I don’t want to be too unfair to Matt here. Even the most ardent supporters
    of missile defense don’t think it could stop a nuclear strike by Russia or China.
    Briefly, ballistic missiles are grouped into four categories, according to their
    range — short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental (ICBM). The longer-range
    a missile is, the faster it moves when it reenters the atmosphere, and thus the
    harder it is to hit. Our best existing anti-missile systems — Israel’s Arrow and
    the U.S.’ THAAD — can only handle intermediate-range ballistic missiles at best.
    ICBMs, of the type that Russia or China would launch against us in a full-scale
    nuclear war, are too fast for us to hit with current technology. Nuclear missiles
    also use other technologies that make them harder to stop, like multiple warheads
    (MIRV), and a nuclear attack might be accompanied by a large number of decoy missiles.

  zh: 现在，我不想对Matt太不公平。即使是导弹防御的最狂热支持者也不认为它能阻止俄罗斯或中国的核打击。简言之，根据射程，弹道导弹分为四类——短程、中程、中间程和洲际（ICBM）。导弹的射程越长，在重新进入大气层时移动得越快，因此越难击中。我们现有的最佳反导系统——以色列的Arrow和美国的THAAD——充其量只能应对中程弹道导弹。而俄罗斯或中国在全面核战争中可能发射的洲际弹道导弹太快了，目前技术无法击中。核导弹还使用其他技术，如多弹头（MIRV），而且核攻击可能伴随大量诱饵导弹。

- en: One big reason critics got missile defense wrong was that they didn’t understand
    the technological advances that were making it possible to “hit a bullet with
    a bullet”. No, the basics of rocketry and aerodynamics haven’t changed much in
    recent years. But the key to hitting a bullet with a bullet isn’t building a faster
    or more maneuverable rocket — it’s *figuring out where the target is going to
    be*. Advances in detection technology — better sensors, and especially better
    software to process the signals from sensors — have made it a lot easier to observe
    a missile’s trajectory to a high degree of precision. Therefore it has become
    more feasible to predict exactly where it’s going to go, so you can get an interceptor

    how fast it was improving? Well, because they’re not experts in the field. This
    isn’t a knock against them, or a demand that they “stay in their lane” — if you’re
    a writer who writes about politics and policy and budget priorities, you pretty
    much *have* to have an opinion on defense spending, because it’s a big and important

    not to blab to the press about missile defense’s true capabilities. Unlike Russia,

  zh: 这段引述归因于罗伯特·富尔格姆，《我在幼儿园学到的真正需要的一切》的作者。我想幼儿园生可能没有学到美国的国防开支[在几十年来一直占国内生产总值的份额下降](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/military-expenditure-share-gdp?tab=chart&time=1952..latest&country=~USA)，或者公共教育开支现在[作为国内生产总值的份额显著增加](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-government-expenditure-on-education-gdp?tab=chart&country=~USA)。
- en: But in any case, the notion that defense spending needs to be cut, and the money
    diverted to social programs, has become [conventional wisdom in progressive circles](https://popular.info/p/when-money-is-no-object?s=r).
    This conventional wisdom seems unrelated to how much we actually spend on defense,
    or [what our national security threats are](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/uh-guys-we-really-should-think-about).
    It’s simply a fixed belief. And that fixed belief makes it a lot easier to believe
    that specific items of defense spending — missile defense, or the F-35, etc. —
    are expensive boondoggles that can and should be cut.

  zh: 但无论如何，认为需要削减国防开支，并将资金转移到社会项目的观念，已成为[进步圈子中的共识智慧](https://popular.info/p/when-money-is-no-object?s=r)。这种共识看似与我们实际上在国防上的支出金额或[我们的国家安全威胁](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/uh-guys-we-really-should-think-about)无关。它只是一种固定的信念。而这种固定的信念使得人们更容易相信国防支出的具体项目——如导弹防御或F-35等——是昂贵的无用之物，可以并且应该被削减。
- en: 'A natural tendency toward short-sightedness about the security environment
    presents a final obstacle to clear-headed writing about defense spending. In the
    mid-2000s, it seemed clear to many people that our main military challenge was
    counterinsurgency — after all, that’s what we were doing in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    In his 2006 article, Yglesias argued that the only reason we’d want missile defense
    is if we wanted to attack other countries:'

  zh: 自然倾向于对安全环境的短视可能是对国防支出清晰写作的最后障碍。在2000年代中期，许多人认为我们的主要军事挑战是反叛乱 — 毕竟，这正是我们在伊拉克和阿富汗所做的。在他2006年的文章中，Yglesias认为，我们想要导弹防御系统的唯一原因是，如果我们想攻击其他国家的话：
- en: The only situation in which a missile shield, if it worked, would possibly be
    useful is if we wanted to invade another country and stop it from deterring us
    with its missiles. This, however, is a pretty terrible idea…Ballistic missile
    defense is, in short, not just a waste of money, but the tip of a wildly misguided
    intellectual iceberg — a whole worldview that radically misconceives the nature
    of America's interests and the contemporary international situation. The conservative
    movement is committed to an outlook that revolves around impractical solutions
    to unreal problems, and missile defense is just one more example to add to a pile
    including the invasion of Iraq, the decision to spurn Iranian peace overtures,
    and the effort to define the (necessary) struggle against al Qaeda in the broadest
    and most apocalyptic terms available.

  zh: 如果导弹防御系统真的有效，唯一可能有用的情况是我们想入侵另一个国家并阻止它用导弹威慑我们。然而，这是一个相当糟糕的主意……简而言之，弹道导弹防御不仅仅是浪费金钱，而且是一个极端误导性的巨大知识冰山的顶端
    —— 一个完全误解了美国利益本质和当代国际形势的世界观。保守派运动致力于围绕不切实际的解决方案来解决不真实的问题的展望，而导弹防御只是另一个例子，例如包括入侵伊拉克、拒绝伊朗的和平提议以及在可能的情况下定义对基地组织的斗争的广泛和末日般的术语。
- en: Fast forward two decades, and this outlook looks dangerously naive. Russia’s
    invasion of Ukraine, Iran’s attacks on Israel, and a possible Chinese attack on
    Taiwan or the Philippines show the importance of ballistic missile defense as
    a way of blocking attacks by invading states. In 2006, in the middle of the War
    on Terror, it might have seemed inconceivable that just 18 years later, the world
    would see multiple authoritarian empires waging aggressive, expansionist wars,
    and that the U.S. and its allies would be playing a beleaguered defense. But here
    we are.

  zh: 快进二十年，这种观点看起来显得非常幼稚和危险。俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，伊朗对以色列的攻击，以及中国可能对台湾或菲律宾的攻击显示了弹道导弹防御的重要性，作为阻止入侵国家攻击的一种方式。在2006年，战争恐怖主义行动中，或许看起来难以置信的是，仅仅18年后，世界将看到多个专制帝国发动侵略性、扩张性战争，而美国及其盟友将扮演一个备受困扰的防御角色。但事实就是如此。
- en: If we could pivot our military procurement and research on a dime, this wouldn’t
    be a problem; we could just direct all our spending and effort to solving the
    problems of the day, instead of trying to think decades ahead. But modern military
    technologies like missile defense or the F-35 are so complex, expensive, and difficult
    that they take decades to develop. The U.S.’ anti ballistic missile program has
    been in development [since the 1950s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile#History),
    and the development of the Arrow program that shot down those Iranian ballistic
    missiles [began in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(missile_family)).

  zh: 如果我们能在军事采购和研究上迅速调整方向，这将不成问题；我们可以将所有的支出和努力都集中在解决当天的问题上，而不是试图预见未来几十年的情况。但是，像导弹防御或F-35这样的现代军事技术如此复杂、昂贵和困难，它们需要数十年来开发。美国的反弹道导弹计划自20世纪50年代开始开发，并且射落伊朗弹道导弹的箭系统的开发从1986年开始。
- en: We can’t know what kinds of threats we’ll be facing in four decades. But we
    have a basic idea about the *types* of threats that might emerge, and “hostile
    power armed with ballistic missiles” was as plausible of a future threat in 2006

  zh: 我们无法预知四十年后将面临哪种威胁。但是，我们对可能出现的威胁类型有一个基本的了解，“拥有弹道导弹的敌对势力”在2006年和1986年一样可能是未来威胁的一种合理设想。机会总是偏向准备好的人。
- en: This is hardly an exhaustive list of the reasons writing about defense spending
    is challenging. Defense contractors, the Defense Department, and the military
    themselves all have their points of view and their interests to protect. Conservatives
    are just as likely to play politics with this issue as progressives. Foreign interests
    are at work here too — countries like Russia and Iran constantly push the narrative
    that they’re peaceful and that U.S. militarism is the main force pushing war upon
    the world. And there’s a whole generation of Americans — my generation — who watched
    the Iraq War unfold during our formative years, and who are thus biased toward
    thinking of wars as something that America chooses instead of something that is
    forced upon us.

  zh: 这并不是关于国防支出挑战的详尽列表。国防承包商、国防部以及军方都有他们的观点和他们要维护的利益。保守派与进步派一样可能在这个问题上玩政治。外国的利益在这里也起作用
    —— 例如俄罗斯和伊朗不断推动他们的叙述，声称他们是和平的，而美国的军国主义是推动全球战争的主要力量。还有一整代美国人 —— 我的这一代人 —— 在我们的成长岁月目睹了伊拉克战争的发生，因此我们倾向于认为战争是美国选择而非被迫的事情。
- en: There’s no easy solution here, other than simply being aware of these difficulties
    and trying very hard to counteract them. We pundits should talk to and listen
    to a variety of experts, not just the loudest and most confident. While recognizing
    that we don’t have enough time to become experts in everything, we should still
    try to understand the underlying technologies as best we can, as well as the details
    of the defense procurement process. And most importantly, in my opinion, we should
    keep the interests of the nation foremost in our mind, and remember that if the
    U.S. goes down, whether Democrats or Republicans are in power will hardly matter.

  zh: 在这里没有简单的解决方案，除了要意识到这些困难并尽力抵制它们。我们这些专家应该与各种专家交流并倾听他们的意见，而不仅仅是那些最响亮和最自信的人。虽然我们明白我们没有足够的时间成为所有事情的专家，但我们仍然应尽力理解底层技术以及国防采购过程的细节。在我看来，最重要的是我们应该把国家的利益放在首位，并记住，如果美国走下坡路，无论是民主党还是共和党掌权几乎都没有什么关系。
