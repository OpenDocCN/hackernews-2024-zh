    against Israel, in retaliation for Israel killing one of Iran’s military commanders.
    The attack included about 170 drones, 120 ballistic missiles, and 30 cruise missiles.
    But something pretty incredible happened — almost all of the drones and missiles
    were shot down before they could hit Israel, by a combination of Israeli, U.S.,
    Jordanian, French, British, and possibly Saudi forces. Only a few ballistic missiles
    made it through, wounding one Arab Israeli girl severely and causing minor injuries
    to a few other people.

    from far more important matters in East Asia, and we should keep our role to a
    minimum. The Gaza war has not fundamentally altered the balance of power in the
    Middle East; Israel and the Sunni powers are unofficial and uneasy partners against
    Iran and its proxies. Both sides are pretty brutal, and neither looks likely to
    dominate the other. U.S. resources and attention are far better spent elsewhere.

    Drones are slow-moving and easy to shoot down, but ballistic missiles are fast-moving
    and generally very hard to hit. Yet Israel’s [Arrow system](https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-missile-defense-iron-dome-arrow-bbf6330918da036f2e000360556a81f6),

    of missile defense don’t think it could stop a nuclear strike by Russia or China.
    Briefly, ballistic missiles are grouped into four categories, according to their
    range — short, medium, intermediate, and intercontinental (ICBM). The longer-range
    a missile is, the faster it moves when it reenters the atmosphere, and thus the
    harder it is to hit. Our best existing anti-missile systems — Israel’s Arrow and
    the U.S.’ THAAD — can only handle intermediate-range ballistic missiles at best.
    ICBMs, of the type that Russia or China would launch against us in a full-scale
    nuclear war, are too fast for us to hit with current technology. Nuclear missiles
    also use other technologies that make them harder to stop, like multiple warheads
    (MIRV), and a nuclear attack might be accompanied by a large number of decoy missiles.

    of missile defense were right that missile defense will probably not provide us
    with an invincible anti-nuclear umbrella anytime soon. But they were wrong about
    much else (as Matt has since [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1779560796822856152)).
    The purpose of this post isn’t to dunk on Matt or any of the other critics — after
    all, [I also believed](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/910362000013832192)
    missile defense didn’t work. But the way in which critics got this issue wrong
    illustrates why it’s difficult to get good information about military technology
    — and therefore why it’s hard for the public to make smart, well-informed choices
    about defense spending.

    the technological advances that were making it possible to “hit a bullet with
    a bullet”. No, the basics of rocketry and aerodynamics haven’t changed much in
    recent years. But the key to hitting a bullet with a bullet isn’t building a faster
    or more maneuverable rocket — it’s *figuring out where the target is going to
    be*. Advances in detection technology — better sensors, and especially better
    software to process the signals from sensors — have made it a lot easier to observe
    a missile’s trajectory to a high degree of precision. Therefore it has become
    more feasible to predict exactly where it’s going to go, so you can get an interceptor
    there first.

    how fast it was improving? Well, because they’re not experts in the field. This
    isn’t a knock against them, or a demand that they “stay in their lane” — if you’re
    a writer who writes about politics and policy and budget priorities, you pretty
    much *have* to have an opinion on defense spending, because it’s a big and important
    part of the budget. No writer can be an expert on everything (except [Brian Potter](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-i-write-posts),
    but he’s one of a kind). So instead, as a writer, you go looking for domain experts
    to explain things to you, or at least point you to some good reading material
    so you can teach yourself the basics.

    journalists looking for an expert on missile defense would often find him and

    but one likely reason is that many of these experts worked for defense contractors
    or for the national defense establishment. So most of them were probably obligated
    not to blab to the press about missile defense’s true capabilities. Unlike Russia,
    which tends to overhype its weapons in order to boost arms exports, the U.S. tries
