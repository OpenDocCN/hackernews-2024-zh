- en: Cairo, a town at the southern tip of Illinois founded in the early 19th century,
    was given that name because it was expected to grow into a huge metropolis. Located
    at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, it was the transport hub
    of a region that became known as “Little Egypt” because of its huge deltaic plains
    where farmers could grow anything.

  zh: 开罗，一个位于伊利诺伊州南端的小镇，始建于19世纪初期，得名于预期其将成长为一个巨大的大都市。位于密西西比河和俄亥俄河的汇流处，它是一个被称为“小埃及”的地区的交通枢纽，因其广阔的三角洲平原，农民在这里可以种植任何作物。
- en: Today, however, the name is redolent of lost civilisations. To walk around is
    a strange experience. Turreted Victorian houses gently crumble, being reclaimed
    by the weeds. What was once downtown (pictured) resembles an abandoned film set.
    Cairo has no petrol stations, no pharmacies and no hospitals. It has gone from
    six schools to two, both half-empty. “When I was growing up in the 1970s, we had
    two grocery stores, we had two gas stations. You know, a lot of businesses were
    still open,” says Toya Wilson, who runs the city’s still operating and beautiful
    Victorian library. One modest grocery store remains, but it is run at a loss by
    a charity and, when your correspondent visited, was deathly quiet, with many bare
    shelves.

  zh: 然而如今，这个名字充满了失落文明的意味。在这里四处走动是一种奇怪的体验。尖塔式的维多利亚式房屋在温柔地崩塌，被杂草夺回。曾经的市中心（见图片）宛如废弃的电影布景。开罗没有加油站，没有药店，也没有医院。从六所学校减少到仅剩两所，而且两所都是半空的。“我在20世纪70年代长大，我们那时有两家杂货店，有两个加油站。你知道，当时很多企业还在营业，”托亚·威尔逊说道，她管理着这座城市依然运营的维多利亚式图书馆，那是一座美丽的建筑。现在仅剩一家普通的杂货店，但是由慈善机构运营，并且亏损经营。当记者到访时，里面死一般的寂静，很多货架空空如也。
