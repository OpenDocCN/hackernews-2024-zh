- en: For the past five years or so, I’ve read books on my phone. The practice started
    innocently enough. I write book reviews from time to time, and so publishers sometimes
    send me upcoming titles that fall roughly within my interests. When a publisher
    provided a choice between a PDF of a book and a physical copy, I would usually
    ask for the PDF, because I didn’t want my house to fill up with books that I might
    end up not reading. But what was at first a matter of clutter-free convenience
    became a habit, and now I encounter nearly every written work, regardless of its
    length, quality, and difficulty, on the small screen of my iPhone.

    The last three books I downloaded onto the Apple Books app are [Rachel Cusk](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/07/rachel-cusk-gut-renovates-the-novel)’s
    novel “[Second Place](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Place-Novel-Rachel-Cusk/dp/1250838681/)”;
    [Malcolm Lowry](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/17/day-of-the-dead)’s
    1947 classic “[Under the Volcano](https://www.amazon.com/Under-Volcano-Novel-Malcolm-Lowry/dp/0061120154),”
    which I bought because I wanted to see if I would enjoy it more than I did when
    read it twenty years ago; and Gary Indiana’s essay collection “[Fire Season](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Season-Selected-Essays-1984-2021/dp/1644211629/).”
    According to the little readout beneath the cover image for each book, I am nine
    per cent through the Cusk, a distressing three per cent through the Lowry reread,
    and a hundred per cent through the Indiana, a book I found liberating, both for
    its style and for its freeing expression of unpleasant thoughts.'

- en: The e-reading apps have their merits. At times, they become respites from the
    other, more addictive apps on my phone. Switching to a book from, say, Twitter,
    is like the phone-scroller’s version of a nice hike—the senses reorient themselves,
    and you feel more alert and vigorous, because you’ve spent six to eight minutes
    going from seven to eleven per cent of [Arthur Koestler](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/30/the-desperate-plight-behind-darkness-at-noon)’s
    “[Darkness at Noon](https://www.amazon.com/Darkness-at-Noon-Arthur-Koestler/dp/1501161318).”
    Or you might feel a sense of pride because you’ve reached the sixty-per-cent mark
    in [Elton John](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/08/26/elton-john-profile-hes-a-little-bit-funny)’s
    autobiography, “[Me](https://www.amazon.com/Me-John-Elton/dp/1509853340/),” which
    isn’t a great work of literature but at least is better than Twitter. The book
    apps also seem to work as a stopgap for children, who are always lusting after
    screen time of any sort. My seven-year-old daughter has read hundreds of books
    on the Libby app, which lets you check out e-books from public libraries you belong
    to. As a parent, I find this wildly preferable to hearing the din of yet another
    stupid [YouTube](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-overlooked-titan-of-social-media)

- en: Still, the arrival of these technologies has been accompanied by a steady decline
    in the number of books that get read in any form. A pair of 1999 Gallup polls,
    for example, found that Americans, on average, had read 18.5 books in the course
    of the previous twelve months. (It should be noted that these were books people
    had read, or said they had read, “either all or part of the way through.”) By
    2021, the number had fallen to 12.6\. In 2023, a National Endowment for the Arts
    survey found that the share of American adults who read novels or short stories
    had declined from 45.2 per cent in 2012 to 37.6 per cent in 2022, a record low.
    There are plenty of theories about [why this is happening](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/24/twilight-of-the-books),
    involving broad finger-pointing toward the Internet or the ongoing influence of
    television, or even shifting labor conditions, as [more women have entered the
    workforce](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-we-dont-read-revisited).

- en: We continue to spend a lot of time reading words, whether via social media or
    push notifications or text messages, but it can seem off to label any of that
    “reading,” a term that suggests something edifying or educational. Even book apps,
    I find, can feel like a sort of in-between, not the time suck of social media
    but also not the comfortable absorption of a good paperback. There’s something
    about scrolling and tapping that leads to a quick calcification of muscle memory.
    You start to tap on the same things not out of familiarity or comfort but out
    of sheer habit. Now that I read on my phone, I give up on new books more quickly
    than I used to. I go back to the same stuff over and over, in the same way that
    I watch the same YouTube videos over and over. I’m not entirely sure why I get
    mired in such a rut; part of it, I suspect, is just that I’m getting older. Of
    the books I’ve recently downloaded, only the Cusk came to me via recommendation
    algorithm, the “For You” box in Apple Books. Even so, I find that my reading habits
    follow a pattern that one might call algorithmic, and which I prefer to call laziness.

    and [at length](https://www.amazon.com/Filterworld-How-Algorithms-Flattened-Culture/dp/0385548281)
    about the seduction of algorithms and the homogenizing effect they have on cultural
    production. But I have found myself wondering whether we actually live in a world
    forcibly shaped by algorithms or whether our phones themselves—their fiddly buttons,
    their flashing screens, their slight but satisfying heft—have other, more fundamental
    ways of making us lazy. If the algorithms are to blame, then we need to find ways
    to get outside of or otherwise away from them. But if the problem is our phones—and,
    of course, us—then we may have to walk away from much more.

- en: The BOOX Palma is a new e-reader that promises an immersive experience for “reading
    an ebook, listening to a podcast, or perusing your favorite news feeds.” It costs
    about two hundred and eighty dollars and is roughly the size of a Google Pixel
    phone. The Palma runs on the Android platform, which means that you can add apps
    like Twitter to the device, but doing so is clearly not the point. The screen
    is matte, gray scale, and plain. Like the Kindle and other e-readers, the Palma
    is supposed to approximate the look of the physical page and cut down on eye fatigue.

    that cell-phone addiction was driven, in part, by the bright colors on our phone.
    Turning your phone display to gray scale would, it was suggested, make things
    feel less immersive and a bit drearier; this, in turn, would help you cut down
    on your screen time. Of course, even if this trick works, you can always change
    your phone back whenever you want. The Palma, though, does not have color options,
    nor does it have cellular service, and that means you cannot connect to the Internet
    without Wi-Fi. You can take the device on long, contemplative walks, listening
    to music or podcasts that you’ve downloaded, knowing that you will not be disturbed
    by a push notification while you stroll through the woods.

- en: I have bought a handful of similar devices through the years, in the vain hope
    that one of them might replace my iPhone. The dream is a handheld object that
    renders the worst and most addictive apps unusable and perhaps even makes the
    good apps—which is to say, word-processing and e-reading apps—a little better.
    There’s always a honeymoon period with these devices, during which I envision
    a whole new life of information consumption. When I bought a Kindle, a few years
    ago, I subscribed to the *Financial Times’s* Kindle delivery service; I pictured
    myself sitting at the table in our kitchen with a bowl of oatmeal, a pot of coffee,
    and the gray-scale version of the *F.T.*, which might not be as nice as the print
    version, with its salmon pages, but is certainly better than reading the newspaper’s
    iPhone app, with a notification buzzing every few minutes. That particular fantasy
    didn’t last a week.

    addictive version of the real thing—doesn’t seem to work. Though the BOOX Palma
    can make the apps gray and accessible only through Wi-Fi, I will probably just
    spend more of my time in Wi-Fi range, watching black-and-white videos. This doesn’t
    mean that the Palma or other e-readers are useless. The Palma has speakers and
    Bluetooth compatibility, so it can work with audiobooks to create something of
    a patchwork of portable text: words issue from the car speakers on my drive to
    my younger child’s day care, pop up on the device’s screen when I’m waiting in
    line for coffee, and finally appear on the desktop monitor in my office, where
    they will get swallowed up by five separate chat platforms and the demands of
    my fantasy-basketball team.'

    I have with the prose on the page—and not, to my surprise, in a bad way. As a
    writer, I often read to remind myself that sentences can, in fact, be interesting.
    This multimedia method of reading creates quick little shots of prose that can
    loosen the writing gears. You can read a few pages of [Bruce Chatwin](https://www.amazon.com/Patagonia-Penguin-Classics-Bruce-Chatwin/dp/0142437190/),
    listen to the next chapter in your car, then bounce back to your Google Docs app
    to spill a bit of short-term inspiration onto your own page. Writers are not entirely
    different from the [large language models](https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/what-kind-of-mind-does-chatgpt-have)
    that [are supposed to replace us](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/whats-the-point-of-reading-writing-by-humans):
    we take in words with our eyes, sort them in our heads, then spit them back out
    in a sequence that mimics a voice. E-readers can provide a point of stylistic
    differentiation. Maybe the L.L.M.s will learn to mimic [Nabokov](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-nabokov)
    better than I can, but I doubt that they will ever sense the difference between
    “[Pale Fire](https://www.amazon.com/Pale-Fire-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/0141185260/)”
    when it’s read out loud and “Pale Fire” on the page, nor can they feel out the
    subtle demands this new form of reading would place upon us writers who, I imagine,
    will soon have to adjust our prose, even subconsciously, to move from screen to
    speaker to second screen. Those of us who care about human interventions into
    style, regardless of how subtle and ultimately insignificant they may be, can
    perhaps take some solace, then, in the possibility that the future of reading
    will be across mediums, devices, and senses. If we are truly being colonized by
    the algorithms and A.I., we at least have more places to hide.'

- en: One of the books that I find myself tapping on repeatedly—without ever getting
    past forty per cent, somehow—is Richard Brautigan’s novella “[Trout Fishing in
    America](https://www.amazon.com/Trout-Fishing-America-Richard-Brautigan/dp/0547255276/).”
    I’m not being compelled by an algorithm. But there’s a surf spot in Marin County
    that I used to go to which is very near the house where Brautigan, in 1984, died
    by suicide. Over the years, I told a handful of other surfers about the links
    between Brautigan and this spot, and later, whenever I would make it back out
    there, I would see the cropping of little houses on the hill overlooking the ocean,
    many of them with chicken runs and ruined vegetable-garden projects, and I would
    think to myself, with a great deal of embarrassment, that I still hadn’t actually
    finished “Trout Fishing in America.” Little compulsions like that one probably
    determine our online behavior more than we would like to admit. What’s particularly
    distressing to me is that, although I can imagine a world in which careful regulation
    and avoidance of algorithms makes phones less addictive, I cannot imagine myself
    freed from such stubborn vanities. ♦
