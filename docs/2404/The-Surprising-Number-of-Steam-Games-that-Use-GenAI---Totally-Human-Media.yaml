    pictures as creative references and sources of inspiration, and professionals
    performed artistic processing on this basis to show the unique art style of "Atman:
    Rebel Flame". At the same time, we also attach great importance to player feedback

    of our item icons and a few NPC portraits, excluding the main characters, were
    produced through a process involving drafts by artists, AI-assisted rendering,
    and adjustments by artists. Moreover, to ensure the final artistic presentation,
    all AI-generated assets have been manually refined by the artists.”'

    XL model.However, the generation of this content was done with complex prompts
    to provide more unique images, in addition, each image was further reviewed to
    provide more detail and alternatives than the basic model.This approach to AI
    was used to initially bring down development costs, which otherwise would have
    been too high to get the game out.In the future, depending on the economic game
    performance, we will gradually replace the AI-generated images with those created
    by a dedicated artist.”'
