    mobile apps, a smartphone has become close to a necessity. Despite this, some
    people avoid smartphones and instead use a dumbphone – a traditional mobile phone
    or a reduced-feature designer phone.'

- en: New research from Aalto University has explored why some people choose not to
    use smartphones and what the consequences are. The study, which will appear in
    the April issue of the prestigious *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction*,
    is based on interviews with participants who chose to give up their smartphone
    or never had one – a decision that can make daily life more burdensome, limit
    choices, and sometimes even increase risks.

    even ordered phones from Africa that weren’t available on the domestic market,’
    says Associate Professor **Janne Lindqvist**, head of the computer science department.

    were available and the obvious choice. Their reasons for turning them down varied.
    Some wanted to get away from the distractions a smartphone unavoidably causes,
    while others wanted to avoid online surveillance. For parents of under-age children,
    the main reasons were a desire to keep their offspring away from social media
    and to avoid the temptation of a smartphone interrupting time with their kids.

    an important role because it doesn’t appear too technically precious or novel,
    and the sometimes cumbersome functionality was seen as a way to prevent excessive
    use. Aside from necessary communication technologies such as voice calls, text,
    and sometimes GPS, dumbphones usually have little else, which is valued by users
    as a way to focus on what they feel really matters,’ explains **Annabel Rothschild**,
    a doctoral researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

    daily lives, starting with the difficulty of finding a durable dumbphone. It also
    proved difficult to make various purchases, deal with two-factor authentication,
    and meet employers' expectations of reaching employees outside working hours or
    locations.

    around the world that limited the interviewees’ mobility. In the worst cases,
    the lack of a smartphone also made life unsafe in the middle of the night, with
    access to quick-call rides limited to mobile apps.

    devices that replaced individual smartphone functions. Many also used a family
    member’s or acquaintance’s smartphone when the need arose. Thus, in practice,
    leading a smartphone-free life requires either technical know-how or flexible
    friends and family.
