    the "orthodox" , or rather conventional thoughts of the bulk. That was my point
    2 in the first answer. If you somehow added a 10cm/sec or 0,1m/sec vector towards
    earth, you would think this is small but would have devastating effects in the
    course of a thousand years, which is more familiar to our timescale.'

    what it is its speed ahhh about 10^3m/sec, soooo you would have to add about 10^
    28 joules to the kinetic energy of the moon, right?

- en: WRONG! This is what happens when you reiterate answers "taught" and not looking
    scholastically into the details. (Been caught myself doing exactly that many times)
    You can put just 10^22 or 10^21 joules to the kinetic energy of the moon in such
    a direction that the moon would acquire a lateral velocity vector of about say
    1m/sec or 0.1 m/sec. This would be enough to move the moon the equivalent of its
    current distance from the earth towards that lateral direction in the course of
    100 to 1000 years.

- en: VERY WRONG AGAIN! Thank you very much. The "megatonnage" of the nuclear arsenal
    of just 2 countries developed in practically 2 decades by Russia and U.S.A. was
    about 12 000 megatons or about 5x 10^19 joule. But people this was an arms race
    half a century ago. Now the whole planet is into building nukes and with a better
    know-how, meaning much shorter times building a certain amount of destructive
    power and far more powerful warheads.

    Russia, China, U.K. Canada, Australia France, Korea,Iran, Pakistan , India etc)
    would build 10^ 22 "joules of destruction" in far less than a century with a hardly
    noticeable effect on their budgets, or alternatively they could build the same
    force in 150 or 200 years, seemingly a lot but nothing in the grand scope of things.

    bodies. Sure it's a certain stretch but very doable within the capacities of the
    current technology.

- en: P.S. The release of the 10^22 joules by an explosion would not necessarily mean
    that this would translate into a velocity to a certain direction. The help of
    a supercomputer would be needed in calculating distance and other parameters so
    we would maximally utilize this energy as motion.
