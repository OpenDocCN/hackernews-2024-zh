- en: I countered that I’d be more confident in my plan if I could discuss the few
    different plans I’m considering and learn which was the most appropriate to the
    patient and why, so that the next time I saw a similar patient, I had a better
    understanding of *why* I was doing what I’m doing instead of just being perceived
    as knowing it. That’s when I’d be confident. Plus, I only had three years to get
    that kind of feedback before I was the one providing that feedback to others.
    There’s never another time during their career when a doc has the opportunity
    to run every single patient they see by a more experienced clinician.

- en: 'I’m as skeptical of residents (and attendings) with too much confidence as
    none: I don’t want my residents to be too confident, to be too thoroughly convinced
    of their own rightness and way. I want them to have the freedom to admit when
    they don’t know everything. Because they don’t. I don’t, either. In *The Name
    of the Rose*, William of Baskerville is a monk but also a proto-detective in the
    mold of Sherlock Holmes, and when he’s trying to solve a series of increasingly
    bizarre murders, he tells his sidekick, Adso, that “we mustn’t dismiss any hypothesis,
    no matter how farfetched.” And so it often is in medicine. Being okay with uncertainty
    will make both residents and attending’s lives better, and more importantly, patient
    lives safer.'

    with most forms of physician evaluation. When going for your quarterly review,
    your boss, who doesn’t directly watch you interact with patients, uses nursing

    satisfaction scores, to determine the depth of your knowledge and ability to care

    When you need a new job, you’re required to get letters of recommendations from
    colleagues who have also never watched you interact with patients directly, and

- en: This is a systems problem. Most physicians who are hired to work in residencies
    didn’t get formal training on how to educate. They happen to work at a site that
    has residents, and so they have to teach. We base how we teach on how we were
    taught. We praise for what we were praised for. I’m not immune. I catch myself
    doing it, too. We teach our residents how to succeed in a system where a doctor’s
    success and a patient’s successful care don’t always spring from the well of thought.

    hire more attendings to both see patients and supervise, spreading both the patient
    care and educational workload. The existing arguments that this is cost prohibitive
    is laughable. For example David Reich, CEO of Mt. Sinai Hospital in NYC made $1,808,577
    in 2023 (excluding bonuses, which can be *impressive*). According to Glassdoor

    education (residency) funding. Per the [Graham Center interactive GME data tool](https://www.graham-center.org/maps-data-tools/gme-data-tables/2000-2021.html)
    Mt. Sinai received  around $175k a year per resident, and pays them a salary of
    $84,479\year, leaving 90K to pay for their “education.” Remember that ER patients
    are being billed, and the physician pay comes from hospital profit. There should
    be plenty of room to hire a few additional physicians, if administrators stopped
    to remember that the residents being trained will one day be the attendings caring
    for them.
