- en: The steam funnels are an appendage of the city’s extensive network of pipes
    that distribute steam, at high pressure and about 400 degrees Fahrenheit, to office
    towers and apartment buildings throughout the densest parts of Manhattan.

- en: Created 142 years ago, the steam system is the United States’s oldest and, with
    105 miles of pipes, its largest. The utility company Consolidated Edison uses
    those pipes, most of which are buried beneath the city’s streets, to supply steam
    for heating, cooling and other commercial uses like dry cleaning.
