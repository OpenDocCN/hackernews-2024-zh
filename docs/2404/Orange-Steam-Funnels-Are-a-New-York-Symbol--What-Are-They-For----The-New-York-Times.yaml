- en: Created 142 years ago, the steam system is the United States’s oldest and, with
    105 miles of pipes, its largest. The utility company Consolidated Edison uses
    those pipes, most of which are buried beneath the city’s streets, to supply steam
    for heating, cooling and other commercial uses like dry cleaning.
