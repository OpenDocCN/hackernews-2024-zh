# Tridge returns to rsync

[Posted April 6, 2024 by jzb]

Wayne Davison has [announced](https://lists.samba.org/archive/rsync-announce/2024/000119.html) the release of [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) [version 3.3.0](https://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/NEWS#3.3.0), which contains a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements. Davison has also announced a change in maintainers and a move to a new GitHub project:

> The github repos have moved to a new RsyncProject organization. Because various life events have been monopolizing my time, I reached out to Tridge [Andrew Tridgell] (the original author) and he has graciously agreed to get back into rsync work, along with Paul Mackerras, who was also an early contributor to rsync. This new team will be working mainly on maintenance tasks, and not so much on new features. If you want to get involved, feel free to reach out on the new discord RsyncProject channels.

The new GitHub organization is [here](https://github.com/RsyncProject/rsync).
