- en: Tesla has issued a recall for effectively every Cybertruck it’s delivered to
    customers due to a fault that’s causing the vehicle’s accelerator pedal to get
    stuck.

- en: '[According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V276-7026.PDF)
    (NHTSA) on Wednesday, the defect can result in the pedal pad dislodging and becoming
    trapped in the vehicle’s interior trim when “high force is applied.”'

- en: The fault was caused by an “unapproved change” that introduced “lubricant (soap)”
    during the assembly of the accelerator pedals, which reduced the retention of
    the pad, the recall notice states. The truck’s brakes will still function if the
    accelerator pedal becomes trapped, though this obviously isn’t an ideal workaround.

    from November 13, 2023, to April 4, 2024,” with the fault estimated to be present
    in 100 percent of the total 3,878 vehicles. This is essentially every Cybertruck
    delivered to customers since its [launch event last year](/2023/11/30/23982569/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-price-specs-features-elon-musk).

    after Cybertruck customers were reportedly notified earlier this week that their
    deliveries were being delayed, with at least one owner being informed by their
    vehicle dealership that the truck was being recalled over its accelerator pedal.
    The issue was also highlighted by [another Cybertruck owner on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@el.chepito1985/video/7357758176504089898),
    showing how the fault “held the accelerator down 100 percent, full throttle.”'

- en: The timeline reported in the NHTSA filing says that Tesla was first notified
    of the defective accelerator pedals on March 31st, followed by a second report
    on April 3rd. The company completed internal assessments to find the cause on
    April 12th before voluntarily issuing a recall. As of Monday this week, Tesla
    said it isn’t aware of any “collisions, injuries, or deaths” attributed to the
    pedal fault.

    April 19th and has committed to replacing or reworking the pedals on recalled
    vehicles at no charge to Cybertruck owners. Any trucks produced from April 17th
    onward will also be equipped with a new accelerator pedal component and part number.

    recall for 2 million Tesla vehicles in the US [back in February](/2024/2/2/24059114/tesla-recall-brake-system-font-size-power-steering)
    due to the font on the warning lights panel being too small to comply with safety
    standards, though this was resolved with a software update.

- en: Tesla fans have taken issue with the word “recall” in the past when the company
    has proven adept at fixing its problems through over-the-air software updates.
    But they likely will have to admit that, in this case, the terminology applies.
