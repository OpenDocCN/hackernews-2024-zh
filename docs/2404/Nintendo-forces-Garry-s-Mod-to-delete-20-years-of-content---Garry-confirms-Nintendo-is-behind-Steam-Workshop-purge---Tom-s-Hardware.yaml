- en: PC gaming classic *Garry's Mod* is nearly 20 years worth of content, as Nintendo
    has issued a takedown notice for all Nintendo-based user content in the [Steam
    Workshop](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/4200245595694413052)
    for the game. Garry, the eponymous creator of the game, [confirmed on Twitter/X](https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494)
    today that there is no mistake, Nintendo themselves issued the major takedown
    notice.

- en: '*Garry''s Mod* players spent the first hours after the announcement questioning
    whether Nintendo truly issued the takedown, pinning the potential blame on trolls.
    However, Garry took to the internet to confirm Nintendo''s involvement. He tweeted,
    "I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit,
    so this will now continue as planned. Sorry. ü´∏üçÑüóëÔ∏è" The Garry''s Mod Steam page
    notes that the process of complying with the takedown will take much time, adding
    "If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and never uploading
    them again, that would help us a lot."'

- en: Nintendo has a reputation for bringing litigation to companies that it belives
    harm its brand. The company received news coverage most recently for a lawsuit
    against the [Yuzu Switch emulator](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/notoriously-litigious-nintendo-sues-maker-of-yuzu-switch-emulator-alleges-it-facilitates-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale),
    arguing in their suit that all emulation in any form is illegal. This move angered
    game preservation and emulation enthusiasts. Today's Garry's Mod takedown is harder
    to argue with, as ripping or copying copyrighted assets is fair game for a DMCA
    request.

- en: Garry's Mod will likely spark good memories longtime PC gamers. The Steam darling
    has been a fixture of the PC gaming landscape since 2006, inspiring many eras
    of internet culture like the multiplayer game modes Prop Hunt and Mafia-like Trouble
    in Terrorist Town which have seen extensive imitations in AAA games, and years
    of YouTube animations culminating in 2023 megahit Skibidi Toilet. The sandbox
    game is known for the massive workshop of user-made creations, which Nintendo
    took issue with when it discovered years' worth of ripped Nintendo assets in-game.
