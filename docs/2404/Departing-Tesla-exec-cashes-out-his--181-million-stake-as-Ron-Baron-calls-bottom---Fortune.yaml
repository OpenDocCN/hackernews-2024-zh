    engineering at [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla/) liquidated virtually
    his entire stake in the company—worth $181 million—days after leaving the company
    last week.

    Tesla said Baglino has exercised the bulk of his vested stock options that converted
    into 1.14 million shares. He promptly dumped them onto the market on Wednesday,
    the day after Tesla filed its 10-Q statement, which was the earliest possible
    opportunity for a corporate insider.

    build the company’s lucrative business in commercial energy storage led by its
    industrial scale Megapack battery, now quite possibly its highest margin manufactured
    product.

    error, and Tesla this quarter stopped publishing deployment figures, its only
    reported metric. Worse, the 4680 cell, once the foundational pillar that would
    ensure Tesla’s cost competitiveness over its rivals, has run into repeated manufacturing
    problems and is now effectively no longer core to its equity story.

    on Tuesday, arguing Battery Day’s main unveil from 2020 was in reality little
    more than a hedge against the soaring cost of sourcing cells from battery suppliers.

    kilowatt-hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every carmaker
    on earth,” Musk continued. Now that cell producers are stuck with excess capacity
    after incumbents like Ford have pulled back from the EV market, prices are a lot
    more favorable for Tesla.
