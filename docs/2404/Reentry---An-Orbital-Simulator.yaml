    amount of subsystems, procedures and controls, the learning curve to even get
    the rocket off the pad in a safe and controlled manner can be hard. After ignition,
    the only way out of the capsule is through an abort. Thousands of gallons of fuel
    are consumed to produce enough thrust to bring the rocket through the initial
    layer of the atmosphere, where the dangers of maximun dynamic pressure are pushing
    the structural limits of the launch vehicle. The automatic guidance logic carefully
    guides the spacecraft into space. At the same time, the astronauts are busy monitoring
    the available data and completes checklists while the cockpit shakes violently.

    that the essential systems needed to keep you alive are functional, and that you
    have a way of returning back to Earth.

- en: Reentry - An Orbital Simulator uses realistic orbital mechanics, and every force
    applied to the spacecraft will affet its attitude and trajectory. Luckily, you
    don't have to learn it all at once to get started. The in-game Academy provides
    multiple lessons for each spacecraft available. Each lesson is focused on one
    or two procecures, and explain them at a basic level. Slowly you will be able
    to put the pieces together, and attempt to get certified in a given spacecraft
    by taking the exam.
