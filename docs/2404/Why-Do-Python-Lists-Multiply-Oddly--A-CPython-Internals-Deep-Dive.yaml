    four times, resulting in `[[], [], [], []]`. And, all these repeated inner lists

    we saw that the first element in it was an instance of the [PyObject](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Include/object.h#L166)

    lies at the beginning of each object).

    includes a pointer to an object of type [PyTypeObject](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Include/cpython/object.h#L146).
    Now, `PyTypeObject` struct is of interest here because it includes fields for
    storing type related information about the object.

    its `PyTypeObject` instance with pointers to those functions. The following illustration

    the `len`, `+` and `*` operations on lists. The pointers to these functions are

    `PyList_Type`).

    at runtime, which the VM can lookup to execute them to handle different operations.
    In fact, every CPython object follows a similar protocol in its implementation
