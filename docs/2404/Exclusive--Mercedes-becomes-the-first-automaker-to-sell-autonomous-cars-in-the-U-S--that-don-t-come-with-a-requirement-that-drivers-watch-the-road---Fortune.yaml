    hands are full with everything but the wheel—scrolling TikTok, applying mascara,
    eating breakfast—don’t panic. It’s all legal in certain states, as long as they’re
    in a new Mercedes with autonomous driving technology.

- en: The luxury automaker has become the first in the nation to start selling self-driving
    cars—at least those that afford riders a hands-free experience—to regular consumers.
    As of April 11, there were 65 Mercedes autonomous vehicles available for sale
    in California, *Fortune* has learned through an open records request submitted
    to the state’s DMV. One of those has since been sold, which marks the first sale
    of an autonomous Mercedes in California, according to the DMV. Mercedes would
    not confirm sales numbers. Select Mercedes dealerships in Nevada are also offering
    the cars with the new technology, known as “level 3” autonomous driving.

- en: Level 3-enabled cars went on sale in December, Mercedes told *Fortune.* California
    and Nevada are the only two states where the company can legally sell the technology
    to consumers. The two state DMVs gave Mercedes approval to begin selling the cars
    last year—Nevada in January, and California in June. Mercedes [announced in September](https://media.mbusa.com/releases/automated-driving-revolution-mercedes-benz-announces-us-availability-of-drive-pilot-the-worlds-first-certified-sae-level-3-system-for-the-us-market)
    its plans to begin sales, but this is the first news of the cars actually reaching
    consumers.

    conditions are met, including in heavy traffic jams, during the daytime, on specific
    California and Nevada freeways, and when the car is traveling less than 40 mph.
    Drivers can focus on other activities until the vehicle alerts them to resume
    control. The technology does not work on roads that haven’t been preapproved by
    Mercedes, including on freeways in other states.

- en: The sales mark a new echelon of autonomous driving available to the average
    American. Mercedes is the first automaker selling to customers to achieve level
    3 capabilities in the U.S., with [Tesla](https://fortune.com/company/tesla/) and
    others still offering technology at level 2—in which cars can perform specific
    tasks but require constant supervision from a driver. Some drivers, however, ignore
    those rules and operate the cars as if they are more capable than they are. One
    family of a deceased driver has accused Tesla[ of hyping its assisted driving
    technology](https://fortune.com/2023/01/18/tesla-autopilot-executive-self-driving-crash-investigation/) as
    fully autonomous, allegedly leading to[ tragic results](https://fortune.com/2024/04/08/tesla-settles-wrongful-death-lawsuit/),
    while California’s DMV last year accused the company of false advertising over
    the matter.

    4, meaning cars drive autonomously in most conditions without human interference.
    But these companies currently don’t sell vehicles to consumers, and Cruise [recently
    halted its service](https://fortune.com/2023/10/27/gm-cruise-grounds-entire-fleet-driverless-vehicles-earn-public-trust-california-suspension-high-profile-accidents/)
    after California’s DMV suspended its license due to an incident in which a car
    dragged a pedestrian under its carriage for 20 feet.

    and S-Class car models for $2,500\. Mercedes began selling level 3-enabled cars
    in its home country of Germany in May 2022\. The European packages cost 5,000
    to 7,000 euros ($5,300 and $7,500) for a three-year membership.

    and taillights to let law enforcement and other drivers know when the car is operating
    autonomously. Drive Pilot is available only on select models that have the built-in
    hardware, including a sensor at the front of the car and a camera in the rear
    windshield.

- en: Mercedes is also working on developing level 4 capabilities. The automaker’s
    chief technology officer, Markus Schäfer, [expects that level 4](https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/mercedes-level-4-automated-driving-doable-decades-end)
    autonomous technology will be available to consumers by 2030, *Automotive News*
    reported. But the jump to level 4 is considerably more difficult than achieving
    level 3\. While humans are still expected to take control of the car based on
    the circumstances in level 3, level 4 technology is supposed to offer near-total
    autonomy. At this level, a driver needs to take over only if the system fails.
    That means the technology must be able to safely respond to nearly all unexpected
    situations on the road.
