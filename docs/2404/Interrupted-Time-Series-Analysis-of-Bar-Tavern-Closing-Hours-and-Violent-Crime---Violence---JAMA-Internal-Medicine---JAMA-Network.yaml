- en: '**Findings**  This interrupted time series analysis of 26 bars/taverns in Baltimore,
    Maryland, found that reducing hours of alcohol sales from 6 am to 2 am to 9 am
    to 10 pm was associated with a 23% annual decrease in all violent crime compared
    with control areas. Furthermore, homicide rates dropped by 51% in the first month
    post intervention and 40% annually thereafter.'

- en: '**Objective**  To evaluate the association of Maryland Senate Bill 571 (SB571),
    which reduced the hours of sale for bars/taverns in 1 Baltimore neighborhood from
    6 am to 2 am to 9 am to 10 pm, with violent crime within that neighborhood.'

- en: '**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This controlled interrupted time series
    analysis compared the change in violent crime density within an 800-ft buffer
    around bars/taverns in the treatment neighborhood (ie, subject to SB571) and 2
    control areas with a similar mean baseline crime rate, alcohol outlet density,
    and neighborhood disadvantage score in the City of Baltimore between May 1, 2018,
    and December 31, 2022\. The interrupted time series using Poisson regression with
    overdispersion adjustment tested whether the violent crime density differed before
    vs after the policy change in the treatment neighborhood and whether this difference
    was localized to the treatment neighborhood.'

- en: '**Main Outcomes and Measures**  The primary outcome was all violent crime,
    including homicide, robbery, aggravated and common assault, and forcible rape.
    Secondary outcomes were homicides and assaults. All violent crime measures summed
    the monthly incidents within 800 ft of bars/taverns from 8 pm to 4 am. For each
    outcome, a level change estimated the immediate change (first month after implementation),
    and a slope change estimated the sustained change after implementation (percent
    reduction after the first month). These level and slope changes were then compared
    between the treatment and control neighborhoods.'

- en: '**Results**  The treatment neighborhood included 26 bars/taverns (mean [SD]
    population, 524.6 [234.6] residents), and the control neighborhoods included 41
    bars/taverns (mean [SD] population per census block, 570.4 [217.4] residents).
    There was no immediate level change in density of all violent crimes the month
    after implementation of SB571; however, compared with the control neighborhoods,
    the slope of all violent crime density decreased by 23% per year in the treatment
    neighborhood after SB571 implementation (annualized incidence rate ratio, 0.77;
    95% CI, 0.60-0.98; *P* = .04). Similar results were seen for homicides and assaults.
    Several sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of these results.'

- en: '**Conclusions and Relevance**  This study’s findings suggest that alcohol policies
    that reduce hours of sale could be associated with a reduction in violent crimes.
    Given these findings, SB571 may serve as a model for other cities looking to create
    safer neighborhoods.'
