    a Statement of Objections in conjunction with its own review. The commission worried
    the deal "may restrict competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners." It
    noted that "because Amazon's online marketplace is a particularly important channel"
    for selling robot vacuums, Amazon "may have the ability and the incentive to foreclose
    iRobot's rivals" either by excluding them from its marketplace or by "degrading
    their access to it."

    The FTC letter worried the merger "could harm consumers and reduce competition

    jobs—and considering the company is [based in Massachusetts](https://about.irobot.com/),
    a substantial number of them may very well be Warren's constituents.
