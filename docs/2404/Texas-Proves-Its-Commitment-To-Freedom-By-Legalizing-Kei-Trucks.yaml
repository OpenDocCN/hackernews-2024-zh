    has proven a hit among American imported car fanatics, and thousands of the tiny
    little guys have been brought into the country. Unfortunately for fans of Liliputian
    work machines, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators [recommended
    states to ban non-FMVSS compliant cars](https://jalopnik.com/here-is-the-organization-behind-the-many-states-banning-1848104429),
    including everything keijidōsha, back in 2021\. [The Texas DMV has issued a ruling](https://www.theautopian.com/heres-the-letter-from-the-texas-dmv-that-lets-people-drive-imported-trucks-again/)
    that [these cars are now, and will remain, street legal for use on Texas roadways](https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/RTB-001-24-Title-and-Registration-Procedures-for-Mini-Vehicles_.pdf).

- en: Since the AAMVA’s non-binding recommendation a few years ago, many states have
    started revoking the registrations of imported vehicles; most notably in Wisconsin,
    Maine, Georgia, Rhode Island, New York, and Pennsylvania. This ruling by the Texas
    DMV makes the state the first since the AAMVA decision which made any effort to
    allow imported cars to be legally driven again. This is all in spite of any imported
    car 25 years or older being perfectly legal in the eyes of the federal government.

    back in 2010, though some Kei enthusiasts have had luck registering and driving
    their trucks since, though it was always policy that non-FMVSS compliant cars
    were not legal in Texas. As of last week, the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles
    [overturned that policy with a letter](https://www.theautopian.com/heres-the-letter-from-the-texas-dmv-that-lets-people-drive-imported-trucks-again/)
    to all county tax assessor-collectors and licensed dealers to provide guidance
    on the titling and registering of mini vehicles. [You can read the letter right
    here](https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/RTB-001-24-Title-and-Registration-Procedures-for-Mini-Vehicles_.pdf).
    The most important part, however, is below:'

- en: Counties should begin accepting and processing title and registration applications
    for mini vehicles and ensure the applicant or dealer provides all required title
    and registration documents, including import documents when applicable. Ensure
    any off-highway use only vehicles are titled but not registered. Do not collect
    a delinquent transfer penalty for mini vehicles impacted by this [Registration
    and Title Bulletin].

    are already hard at work to make similar legal changes in Georgia, Pennsylvania,
    and Maine. Good luck, and Godspeed, ye heroes.
