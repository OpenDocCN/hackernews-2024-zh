Tools like CISA’s Malware Next-Gen are invaluable assets in the fight against cybercrime, particularly in a world where data is the new currency, according to Sakshi Grover, research manager at IDC.

“AI/ML techniques are being widely exploited by attackers to craft sophisticated malware, bypass security systems, and execute large-scale automated attacks, potentially leading to evasive and impactful cyber incidents,” said Grover. **“**The comprehensive data repository amassed by CISA’s Malware Next-Gen tool serves as a valuable resource to enrich AI-powered threat-hunting capabilities. It can also help future enterprises, to protect themselves against existing and unknown attacks.”

CISA said Malware Next-Gen is currently providing malware analysis support to all US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governmental agencies. Analysis is performed by a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools in a secure environment and results are available in PDF and STIX 2.1 data formats.
