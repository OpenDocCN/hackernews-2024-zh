    (IMD) to issue a heatwave warning: The criteria do NOT consider humidity, only
    temperature. Anyone who lives in a hot climate or any climate that includes hot
    summer days knows that humidity can make a huge difference in whether one can
    stay cool in hot weather. It turns out that the IMD criteria fail to recognize
    that temperatures below what is considered a heatwave may be just as dangerous
    to human health when humidity is high and even be downright life-threatening.
    In short, India is already experiencing conditions that at times are at or near
    the limits of human suvivability.'

    This web-bulb temperature is supposed to mimic the way that humans cool themselves
    through perspiration. At very high humidity, it becomes hard to get perspiration
    on the skin to evaporate which is what allows for cooling of the body. It's why
    a handheld or electric fan helps cool the body because it speeds up evaporation.

    very infrequently anywhere on Earth. Recent studies suggest that 40 years ago
    such extremes occurred once or twice a year somewhere on the planet. Now models
    suggest they are occurring 25 to 30 times per year. Without dramatic reductions
    in greenhouse gases, these extremes will become increasingly common. "Such conditions

    (AMOC), moves heat from the tropics, along the U.S. coast, then across the Atlantic
    to the British Isles and turns back and north to Iceland and Greenland. There,
    having lost much of its heat, it turns downward into the Atlantic depths to between
    6,000 to 9,000 feet and begins a journey back to the equator and along South America.

    by all of human civilization. This explains why Northern Europe—a branch of the
    AMOC flows toward Scandanavia as well—and Iceland are much warmer than their high
    latitudes would suggest. If the energy transfer were to slow dramatically or stop,
    it would almost certainly plunge these areas into a much colder climate regime,

    When researchers discovered in their calculations and modeling that the AMOC might
    start its next collapse as early as 2025, they couldn''t believe it. They rechecked
    the results, and the conclusion was confirmed. Their model suggests that the current
    could begin collapsing anywhere from 2025 to 2095\. (Some scientists pointed out
    the considerable uncertainties in the model, a legitimate criticism. My response:
    Shall those in the path of potential destruction simply wait and do nothing until
    the model can be better confirmed? If so, how long should they wait?)'

    suggests once again that the catastrophic effects of climate change aren't merely
    going to be someone else's problem in the distant future. In the coming decades
    humans could be migrating away from catastrophes which either make life too hot
    to be bearable...or too cold—both due to climate change.
