- en: ']. An antidote against opioid overdose has served admirably in this role for
    more than 50 years, yet nothing is available for cannabinoid overdose. In principle,
    a competitive CB1 antagonist could serve this role; however, it may not be efficacious
    in an overdose of a high-affinity synthetic cannabinoid. An intriguing, novel
    approach to antagonizing CB1 signaling in an overdose setting would be to use
    a CB1 negative allosteric modulator. As a non-competitive agent, such a compound
    might prove to be versatile and effective against compounds regardless of their
    affinity at the orthosteric site. The current project was initiated to explore
    whether CB1 NAMs could effectively reverse the effects of an SC in vitro using
    a neuronal model of endogenous cannabinoid signaling and, if so, to learn whether
    such a compound might be effective in vivo. Our chief findings are that all CB1
    NAMs tested were able to block and reverse the effects of JWH018 in autaptic neurons,
    though the potency varied considerably. Of the three compounds that were effective
    in vitro, only two were able to prevent the effect of JWH018 when given in advance.
    Only one of these—PSNCBAM1—was effective at less than 10 mg/kg. Importantly, PSNCBAM1
    was also able to reverse the effects of JWH018 when given after JWH018, mimicking
    an emergency situation. Importantly, PSNCBAM1 did not induce withdrawal in mice
    chronically treated with JWH018\. Taken together, our findings suggest that a
    CB1 NAM can, in principle, serve as an antidote to cannabinoid overdose/toxicity
    in an emergency setting.'

- en: 'The successful use of an antidote in an emergency setting comes with some specific
    requirements. First, the compound must be effective even against a high-affinity
    compound. Our tests against the canonical SC JWH018 suggest that a CB1 NAM can
    work against a high-affinity agonist in vivo. Second, the antidote must be fast-acting,
    preferably in minutes. Here, we saw evidence for an effect within 15 min after
    IP injection, and it is possible that the compound acts more rapidly. Most CB1
    NAMs described so far have lipophilic structures and, thus, are expected to readily
    penetrate the blood–brain barrier. However, this may be affected by the route
    of administration, and this is the third major requirement: the method of administration
    must be suited to an emergency setting. SCs have been associated with psychotic
    episodes, meaning that treatment may not be voluntary. In emergency situations
    outside of a hospital, intranasal and intramuscular (IM) modes of treatment are
    the most likely methods of administration, but for an uncooperative patient, IM
    injection may be the only suitable approach. Lipophilic compounds applied intramuscularly
    may have longer loitering times, since they readily absorb into local membranes.
    The presence of adipose tissue may also serve as a local sink for injected compounds.
    The question of how rapidly a compound such as PSNCBAM1 works will require pharmacokinetic
    studies in human subjects.'

    autaptic model was not a predictor of the effectiveness of a compound in vivo.
    Indeed, the least potent compound in terms of reversing the effects of JWH018

    effects are less dependent on the signaling pathways that underlie the inhibition

    For an opioid antagonist, the picture is clear, since deaths associated with opioid

    do with the nature of these synthetic cannabinoids. For cannabis toxicity, the
    chief concern is THC, mainly acting at CB1 receptors in the CNS. Over the last
    dozen years, it was safe to assume that CB1 was the chief target of synthetic
    cannabinoids, but there are signs that this may be changing. Because government
    regulations tended to be reactive, targeting specific compounds once they appeared
    on the drug scene, producers focused on ‘tweaking’ the original compound to develop
    new drugs that would evade restrictions while preserving the desired CB1 agonist
    profile. More than 200 synthetic cannabinoids have appeared over the last 15 years.
    However, the Chinese government—and there is evidence that the bulk of these compounds
    are produced in China—has enacted legislation targeting the scaffold itself, with
    the consequence of a shift to different scaffolds (reviewed in [
  prefs: []

    a much different pharmacological profile (i.e., they may engage other CNS receptors
    in addition to CB1), though it seems likely that the compounds will still have
    strong CB1 agonist properties. While previous compounds reliably served as strong,
    relatively selective CB1 agonists and, thus, motivated the development of a CB1
    antidote, the current study only examined JWH018, and this may not hold for future
    classes of SCs.'

- en: Our finding that, in contrast to the competitive CB1 antagonist SR141716A, PSNCBAM1
    did not induce withdrawal may have broad implications for the therapeutic application
    of CB1 NAMs. Given the sheer numbers of opioid-related overdoses and fifty years
    of experience with naloxone, there is considerable experience with opioid withdrawal
    in an emergency setting. Opioid withdrawal is deeply aversive and there are countless
    reports of aggression and even violence against first responders during precipitated
    opioid withdrawal. For cannabinoid toxicity, to our knowledge, this has not been
    investigated in humans, since no CB1 antagonist has been available for this purpose.
    There is evidence for a spontaneous cannabis withdrawal syndrome with symptoms
    such as anxiety and irritability [

    is accompanied by strong signs, reminiscent of opioid withdrawal in similar models.
    Thus, if a compound serves as an antidote to cannabinoid toxicity without inducing
    withdrawal symptoms, this would presumably be advantageous over one that does.
    On a related point, it is possible that a CB1 NAM would not cause the dysphoric
    effects that led to the withdrawal of rimonabant (SR141716A) (reviewed in ['
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    agonist at CB1 and, thus, are unlikely to be mimicked by a CB1 NAM. In any event,
    a single use in an emergency setting may allow for some more flexibility in terms
    of the side effect profile.'

    ability to reverse the effects of a canonical designer synthetic cannabinoid,
    JWH018\. We found that all CB1 NAMs were able to reverse the effects in vitro,
    and that two of the compounds acted similarly in vivo. One of these, PSNCBAM1,
    was additionally tested and found to reverse JWH018 effects and was found to act
    without inducing withdrawal in a mouse model. Our findings serve as proof-of-concept
    that a CB1 NAM could serve as an antidote for cannabinoid toxicity, though additional
    studies will be required to further assess the suitability of this strategy.

    a nocifensive response by the cut-off time, the test was terminated, a latency
    of 15 s was recorded, and the mouse was defined as analgesic.'

- en: To determine a dose response for JWH018 in this model, naïve mice were exposed
    to an acute dose of JWH018 (0.03–3 mg/kg; i.p.) and subsequently tested for latencies
    every 15 min over 75 min post-injection. Based on the dose response, we chose
    0.5 mg/kg JWH018 for subsequent experiments.

    antinociception. Compounds were initially tested at 10 mg/kg (i.p.) administered
    30 min before JWH018\. Following this preliminary assessment, PSNCBAM1 was selected
    for further testing. This involved the co-application of PSNCBAM1 and JWH018 and
    the monitoring of nociceptive responses as above. Additionally, in a separate
    experiment, PSNCBAM1 was administered 45 min after JWH018 to determine whether
    it would antagonize antinociception with JWH018.

- en: Mice were injected daily with JWH018 (0.5 mg/kg, IP) for one week. Forty-five
    minutes after the seventh injection, mice were treated with PSCNBAM1 (10 mg/kg,
    IP). Mice were monitored for 15 min after the last JWH018 treatment starting 15
    min after the injection and again 15 min after PSNCBAM1 injections. Head shakes
    and paw tremors were counted. A subset of mice additionally received an injection
    with SR141716 (4 mg/kg, IP) 45 min after their PSNCBAM1 injections and were monitored
    as above for evidence of withdrawal behaviors.

- en: JWH018 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). ABD1085 was provided
    by Dr. Iain Greig. RTICBM189 was provided by Dr. Yanan Zhang. PSNCBAM1 was purchased
    from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). For electrophysiology experiments,
    drugs were prepared as a stock at a high concentration (typically 10 mM) in DMSO
    or ethanol, then diluted shortly before a given experiment. Solvent concentrations
    did not exceed 0.1%. For in vivo experiments, drugs were prepared for intraperitoneal
    injection in an ethanol/kolliphor/saline mixture (1:1:18). In the case of JWH018,
    which was received from the manufacturer in methanol, the methanol was evaporated
    away shortly before the experiment and resuspended in ethanol, then added to the
    kolliphor/saline mixture as above.
