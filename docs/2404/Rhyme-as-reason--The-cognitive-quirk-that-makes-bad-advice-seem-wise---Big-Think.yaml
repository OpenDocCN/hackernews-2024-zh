    a hangover. The next morning, I told my dad what happened over breakfast. “We
    had some wine at the restaurant,” I groaned, “and then a few beers at Mark’s house.
    It doesn’t seem enough for me to feel this bad.” My dad chuckled the chuckle of
    the knowing. He then said something I carry with me to this day: “Beer before
    wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll feel queer.”'

    the years, only a few stick in my memory. And those are the ones that *rhyme*d.

    wisdom as more reputable than non-rhyming equivalents. If my dad had said, “Don’t

- en: 'There’s an odd and often frustrating fact: You might be able to remember the
    entire six verses of some obscure song from your childhood, yet you can’t remember
    something from last week. The reason is that the human mind retains things as
    a rhyme, song, or poem far easier than plain prose. Major examples of early literature
    — such as the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, the *Iliad*, and the Psalms — were written
    as poems. Not only did this make for exciting recitation, but it also meant people
    could memorize great swathes easily.'

  zh: 有   有一个奇怪且常常令人沮丧的事实：你或许能记住你童年时某首 obscure 歌曲的所有六句歌词，但却记不住上周的事情。原因在于人类的大脑更容易将事物记住为押韵的诗歌、歌曲或诗篇，而不是平凡的散文。早期文学的主要例子——如《吉尔伽美什史诗》、《伊利亚特》和《诗篇》——都是以诗歌形式写成的。这不仅使得朗诵变得精彩，还意味着人们可以轻松地记住大量内容。
- en: In 1995, the cognitive psychologist David Rubin wrote a book called *Memory
    in Oral Traditions.* In it, he runs through the differences between literary and
    oral cultures and lays out the necessary factors that allow the latter. One such
    factor is the use of rhyming. To prove the point, Rubin conducted an experiment.
    He got his students to try to remember a ballad using two rhyming words. He then
    compared their performance with a group that had non-rhyming words. The rhyming
    group overwhelmingly outperformed the non-rhyming group.

  zh: 1995年，认知心理学家大卫·鲁宾写了一本名为《口头传统中的记忆》的书。在书中，他探讨了文学文化和口头文化之间的差异，并列出了允许后者存在的必要因素。其中一个因素就是押韵的使用。为了证明这一观点，鲁宾做了一个实验。他让他的学生试着用两个押韵的词记住一首民谣。然后，他将他们的表现与使用非押韵词的另一组进行比较。押韵组的表现远远超过了非押韵组。
- en: Why is this the case? Rubin hypothesized that it is all in the way we recall
    things. Let’s say you are trying to remember the name of someone you met just
    once. Without any hints or pointers, you have nearly infinite options for your
    mind to dizzily guess its way through. But, with a rhyme, there are fewer. The
    path leads to only one or a few places. For example, “That man was so grave, and
    his name was [blank].” Only a few mnemonic options fill in that blank.

  zh: 为什么会这样？鲁宾假设这一切都取决于我们记忆事物的方式。假设你正试图记住曾经见过一次的某人的名字。在没有任何提示或指针的情况下，你的大脑有几乎无限的选择来迷失方向。但是，有了押韵的帮助，选择就变少了。路径只会指向一个或少数几个地方。例如，“那个人是如此严肃，他的名字是[空白]。”
    只有少数几个记忆辅助选项可以填入这个空白处。
- en: More recent studies seem to show [Rubin was on to something](http://sofferpsychmemory.weebly.com/semantic-acoustic-and-visual-levels-of-encoding.html).
    When we use rhymes, we break down information into something that can more easily
    be stored and retrieved — in something called [semantic encoding](http://sofferpsychmemory.weebly.com/semantic-acoustic-and-visual-levels-of-encoding.html).

- en: The second aspect of the rhyme-as-reason effect is that not only do we retain
    and recall rhymes easier, but we judge them more favorably. Friederick Nietzsche
    was a big fan of aphorisms. In fact, he wrote a series of books entirely in aphorisms
    because he knew that a well-crafted turn of phrase cuts into your understanding
    far quicker than prose. In *Gay Science*, he wrote, “Even now … the wisest among
    us are still occasionally fooled by rhythm — if only insofar as we sometimes consider
    an idea truer simply because it has a metrical form and presents itself with a
    divine skip and jump.” It is easier to manipulate and draw someone in if you speak
    eloquently or poetically. People often confuse verbosity with authority.

  zh: 押韵作为理由效应的第二个方面是，我们不仅更容易保留和回忆押韵的内容，而且更倾向于对其评价更高。弗里德里希·尼采非常喜欢谚语。事实上，他写了一系列完全由谚语组成的书籍，因为他知道一个精心制作的词语转折比散文更快地切入你的理解。在《欢乐的科学》中，他写道，“即使到现在...我们中最聪明的人有时仍会被节奏所迷惑
    —— 如果我们有时因为一个想法有韵律的形式而认为它更真实，那只是因为它跳跃出来并呈现得非常神圣。” 如果你能雄辩或诗意地表达，就更容易操控并吸引他人。人们经常将冗长误认为是权威。

- en: There are two important lessons to learn from this. The first is that rhyming
    is a great mnemonic. If you want to retain it, rhyme it. The second is to appreciate
    that just because you remember something in rhyme doesn’t make it accurate. My
    dad’s wisdom, “Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll
    feel queer,” might sound neat but is based on scant and dubious evidence. Better
    something like “Consume a lot of booze; you’ll get the hangover blues.” Keep in

  zh: 这里有两个重要的教训需要从中学到。第一个是押韵是一个很好的记忆方法。如果你想记住它，就押韵吧。第二个是要明白，仅仅因为你用押韵记住了某件事，并不意味着它是准确的。我爸爸的智慧，“啤酒在前，葡萄酒在后，你会感觉良好；葡萄酒在前，啤酒在后，你会感觉古怪”，听起来可能很好，但基于不足和可疑的证据。更好的是像“喝多了酒，头痛欲裂”。请记住，一个优美的措辞未必比一个笨拙的措辞更好。
