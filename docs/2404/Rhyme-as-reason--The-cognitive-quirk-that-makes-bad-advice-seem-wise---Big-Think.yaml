    a hangover. The next morning, I told my dad what happened over breakfast. “We
    had some wine at the restaurant,” I groaned, “and then a few beers at Mark’s house.
    It doesn’t seem enough for me to feel this bad.” My dad chuckled the chuckle of
    the knowing. He then said something I carry with me to this day: “Beer before
    wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll feel queer.”'

    but the point is that out of all the many tidbits of advice he handed down over
    the years, only a few stick in my memory. And those are the ones that *rhyme*d.
    There’s a mnemonic heft to a well-turned phrase, and a rhyming line lodges itself
    far easier than an entire book’s worth of learning.

    wisdom as more reputable than non-rhyming equivalents. If my dad had said, “Don’t
    drink wine before beer,” then I would have grunted and tutted it away. As his
    words *rhymed,* though, I gave them credence.

    entire six verses of some obscure song from your childhood, yet you can’t remember
    something from last week. The reason is that the human mind retains things as
    a rhyme, song, or poem far easier than plain prose. Major examples of early literature
    — such as the *Epic of Gilgamesh*, the *Iliad*, and the Psalms — were written
    as poems. Not only did this make for exciting recitation, but it also meant people
    could memorize great swathes easily.'

    in Oral Traditions.* In it, he runs through the differences between literary and
    oral cultures and lays out the necessary factors that allow the latter. One such
    factor is the use of rhyming. To prove the point, Rubin conducted an experiment.
    He got his students to try to remember a ballad using two rhyming words. He then
    compared their performance with a group that had non-rhyming words. The rhyming
    group overwhelmingly outperformed the non-rhyming group.

    things. Let’s say you are trying to remember the name of someone you met just
    once. Without any hints or pointers, you have nearly infinite options for your
    mind to dizzily guess its way through. But, with a rhyme, there are fewer. The
    path leads to only one or a few places. For example, “That man was so grave, and
    his name was [blank].” Only a few mnemonic options fill in that blank.

    When we use rhymes, we break down information into something that can more easily
    be stored and retrieved — in something called [semantic encoding](http://sofferpsychmemory.weebly.com/semantic-acoustic-and-visual-levels-of-encoding.html).

- en: The second aspect of the rhyme-as-reason effect is that not only do we retain
    and recall rhymes easier, but we judge them more favorably. Friederick Nietzsche
    was a big fan of aphorisms. In fact, he wrote a series of books entirely in aphorisms
    because he knew that a well-crafted turn of phrase cuts into your understanding
    far quicker than prose. In *Gay Science*, he wrote, “Even now … the wisest among
    us are still occasionally fooled by rhythm — if only insofar as we sometimes consider
    an idea truer simply because it has a metrical form and presents itself with a
    divine skip and jump.” It is easier to manipulate and draw someone in if you speak
    eloquently or poetically. People often confuse verbosity with authority.

    this phenomenon and wrote up their findings in a paper called “[The Keats heuristic:
    Rhyme as reason in aphorism interpretation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X99000030).”
    They presented their participants with a series of aphorisms. Some participants
    received aphorisms that rhymed; others received aphorisms rewritten with non-lyrical
    synonyms. For example:'

    sentences, they more often than not thought them more accurate. Despite participants
    agreeing that aesthetic qualities don’t bestow truth, they couldn’t avoid their
    own biases. This led the team to call it the “Keats heuristic” after the poet
    [John Keats’s line](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44477/ode-on-a-grecian-urn):
    “Beauty is truth; truth is beauty.” It turns out that we are inclined to not only
    retain rhymes better but value them more highly as well.'

- en: There are two important lessons to learn from this. The first is that rhyming
    is a great mnemonic. If you want to retain it, rhyme it. The second is to appreciate
    that just because you remember something in rhyme doesn’t make it accurate. My
    dad’s wisdom, “Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine; wine before beer and you’ll
    feel queer,” might sound neat but is based on scant and dubious evidence. Better
    something like “Consume a lot of booze; you’ll get the hangover blues.” Keep in
    mind that a nice turn of phrase isn’t necessarily better than a clumsier one.
