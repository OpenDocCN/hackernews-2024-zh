- en: 'Instagram’s co-founders built a powerful and useful tool for recommending news
    to readers — but could never quite get it to scale. Yahoo has hundreds of millions
    of readers — but could use a dose of tech-forward cool to separate it from all
    the internet’s other news aggregators. And so, the two sides are joining forces:
    Yahoo is acquiring Artifact, the companies announced on Tuesday.'

- en: The two sides declined to share the cost of the acquisition, but both made clear
    Yahoo is acquiring Artifact’s tech rather than its team. Mike Krieger and Kevin
    Systrom, Artifact’s co-founders, will be “special advisors” for Yahoo but won’t
    be joining the company. Artifact’s remaining five employees have either gotten
    other jobs or are planning to take some time off.

- en: The acquisition comes a bit more than [a year after Artifact’s launch](/2023/1/31/23579552/artifact-instagram-cofounders-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-news-app)
    and about three months after Systrom and Krieger [announced its death](/2024/1/12/24036539/artifact-shutting-down-kevin-systrom).
    “We have built something that a core group of users love,” the co-founders [wrote
    in January](https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419),
    “but we have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant
    continued investment in this way.” They said that the biggest reason to shut down
    was in order to focus on “newer, bigger and better things that have the ability
    to reach many millions of people.” The bet behind Artifact was always that AI
    had the potential to be a huge, internet-changing technology; maybe there were
    just more interesting things to work on than a news app without a big news audience.

- en: Systrom and Krieger posted the note without shopping the company to potential
    suitors or trying to raise money. They were Artifact’s only investors, they’d
    run a pretty lean business, and they felt like they could just move on. But then,
    companies started calling. Systrom tells me that he had “on the order of 10” conversations
    with other companies after the shutdown note. “A lot of organizations care deeply
    about news and personalized content,” he says, “and I think they’re looking around
    and saying ‘Wow, there’s this new wave of AI… maybe we should figure out what’s
    going on.’ Maybe that’s what I discounted originally.”

- en: Yahoo was one of those calls. The company first began exploring an Artifact
    acquisition after reading that shutdown letter, says Kat Downs Mulder, the general
    manager for Yahoo News. “They put a ton of love and care into the way that their
    content taxonomy and recommendation systems work,” she says. “How the content
    is categorized, what signals feed into that content, how to identify what’s really
    working and can connect and is relevant with you, and then the UX of connecting
    the user with that content — that whole journey is really hard to get right.”
    Yahoo has long been working on personalization and recommendations, but Artifact
    built something special.

  zh: 雅虎是其中之一的通话。首席雅虎新闻经理 Kat Downs Mulder 表示，在阅读了那封关闭信之后，公司首次开始探索收购 Artifact。“他们非常注重和关心他们的内容分类法和推荐系统的工作方式，”她说。“内容如何分类，哪些信号输入到内容中，如何识别真正有效并且与您相关联的内容，以及将用户与内容连接的用户体验
    —— 整个过程真的很难做到。” 雅虎长期致力于个性化和推荐，但 Artifact 建立了一些特别的东西。
- en: That’s what Artifact brings to Yahoo. What does Yahoo offer Artifact (other
    than that undisclosed acquisition price)? Eyeballs. Downs Mulder says more than
    185 million people come to Yahoo News every month, which puts Artifact’s personalization
    and recommendation tech in front of a vastly larger set of users than it likely
    ever would have gotten on its own. For Systrom, that also means a chance to really
    see it work. “Every month, we would chip away at growth,” Systrom says, “and we
    would get to the scale where some of the things we were promised in machine learning
    and AI would start working, because we had *just* enough scale to make them work.
    But it was really hard to move that needle.” Integrating with Yahoo will happen
    slowly, but it will move that needle in a big way.

  zh: 这就是 Artifact 带给雅虎的。雅虎除了未透露的收购价格之外，还给 Artifact 提供了什么？眼球。Downs Mulder 表示，每个月有超过
    1.85 亿人访问雅虎新闻，这使得 Artifact 的个性化和推荐技术得以展示在比它自己可能获得的更大规模的用户面前。“每个月，我们都会渐渐增长，”Systrom
    说，“我们将达到某些我们在机器学习和人工智能中承诺的东西开始发挥作用的规模，因为我们有足够的规模让它们发挥作用。但是要移动这个指针确实很困难。” 与雅虎的整合将会慢慢进行，但它将以巨大的方式推动这个指针。
- en: Artifact, the app, will go away once the acquisition is complete. But Artifact’s
    underlying tech for categorizing, curating, and personalizing content will soon
    start to show up on Yahoo News — and eventually on other Yahoo platforms, too.
    “You’ll see that stuff flowing into our products in the coming months,” says Downs
    Mulder. It sounds like there’s also a good chance that Yahoo’s apps might get
    a bit of Artifact’s speed and polish over time, too.

  zh: 一旦收购完成，应用 Artifact 将不复存在。但 Artifact 用于分类、策展和个性化内容的底层技术很快将开始出现在雅虎新闻上 —— 并最终出现在其他雅虎平台上。“在未来几个月内，你将看到这些内容流入我们的产品中，”Downs
    Mulder 说。听起来雅虎的应用程序也有可能随着时间的推移获得 Artifact 的速度和精致度的一部分。
- en: Both Systrom and Downs Mulder say the integration will take time, that you can’t
    just drop an Artifact algorithm into Yahoo News and call it a day. But they see
    a possibility to get everybody into the future a little faster. Yahoo can develop
    a personalized content ecosystem, the “TikTok for text” that was so alluring to
    Artifact users. And Artifact can power a news service of the future.

  zh: Systrom 和 Downs Mulder 都表示，整合需要时间，不能仅仅将 Artifact 的算法投入到雅虎新闻中就完事了。但他们看到了一个让所有人更快进入未来的可能性。雅虎可以发展个性化内容生态系统，这对
    Artifact 用户来说是如此诱人的“文字版 TikTok”。Artifact 也可以为未来的新闻服务提供动力。
- en: Systrom, meanwhile, says he doesn’t know what’s next. He’s focused on making
    sure the Yahoo transition goes well, and he and Krieger are always thinking about
    new ideas. He says he’s as bullish as ever on AI and is asking big questions about
    what the world needs in an era powered by large language models. But “starting
    companies is not a seasonal business,” he says. “You don’t, like, start something
    new every fall.” The idea for Artifact felt too good to pass up — now, he’s looking
    for the next one.

  zh: 同时，Systrom 表示他不知道接下来会发生什么。他专注于确保雅虎的过渡顺利进行，并且他和 Krieger 总是在思考新的想法。他说他对 AI 依然充满信心，并且在大型语言模型驱动的时代，他正在探讨关于世界在这个时代需要什么的重大问题。但是他说：“创办公司不是季节性的事业。你不会像每年秋天都开启一些新的东西。”Artifact
    的想法实在太好了，他现在正在寻找下一个。
