    Pro Ultra. Born from the shards of countless broken screens, the ashes of hundreds
    of burnt batteries, and a little technological wizardry, these aren’t your average
    tools. They are monuments to precision, durability, and innovation. Composed of
    cutting-edge nano molecular carbon flex lattice technology they’re practically
    science fiction.'

    need a little extra prying power. It’s great for removing stubborn components,
    fixing small appliances, and household repairs. Dealing with a stuck power connector?
    Prying apart pesky adhesive? The Spudger XL turns the daunting into the doable,

- en: Still not enough? The Spudger Pro Ultra has enough prying force to practically
    scare any device open without touching it. Its imposing size means you’ll never
    have to worry about adhesive or stuck parts ever again. Additionally, using our
    technomancy skills, we’ve imbued the Spudger Pro Ultra with the power of 1734
    standard Spudgers. In theory, this spudger should outperform our standard spudger
    by a factor of 13\. That means for every device you fix using the Spudger Pro
    Ultra, another 12 devices will fix themselves. Imagine walking into a room and
    simply by holding the Spudger Pro Ultra, smartphone screen cracks disappear, batteries
    regain their charge capacity, and dried-out thermal paste becomes new. It’s not
    just a tool; it’s the next repair revolution.
