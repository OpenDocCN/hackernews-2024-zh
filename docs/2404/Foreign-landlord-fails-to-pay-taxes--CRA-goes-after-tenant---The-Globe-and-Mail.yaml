    on the monthly rent to his non-resident landlord, as required by law. As a result,
    he was ordered to pay six years’ worth of tax as well as the compounded interest
    and penalties. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) could not collect against his overseas

    the Minister of National Revenue to court, arguing that he did not know his landlord
    was a non-resident. The tenant, whose Italy-based landlord owned a single unit
    in a Montreal building, lost the Tax Court appeal on the grounds that they were
    a Canadian resident paying rent to a non-resident landlord, and were therefore
    required to withhold and remit 25 per cent of the rent to the CRA. The judge acknowledged
    “the harsh consequences,” in her decision, but still held the “resident payer,”
    or renter, liable.
