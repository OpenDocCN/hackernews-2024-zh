    on the monthly rent to his non-resident landlord, as required by law. As a result,
    he was ordered to pay six years’ worth of tax as well as the compounded interest
    and penalties. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) could not collect against his overseas
    landlord, so the Canadian tenant was on the hook.

    the Minister of National Revenue to court, arguing that he did not know his landlord
    was a non-resident. The tenant, whose Italy-based landlord owned a single unit
    in a Montreal building, lost the Tax Court appeal on the grounds that they were
    a Canadian resident paying rent to a non-resident landlord, and were therefore
    required to withhold and remit 25 per cent of the rent to the CRA. The judge acknowledged
    “the harsh consequences,” in her decision, but still held the “resident payer,”
    or renter, liable.

    on properties they either sell or rent out. However, few renters and few in the
    [real estate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/real-estate/) business are
    aware that if those taxes don’t get paid, the tenant could be on the hook, said
    long-time realtor Lorne Goldman. Mr. Goldman sells properties to non-residents,
    and said realtors – and all renters and all small mom-and-pop landlords – should
    be formally educated on the risks to tenants.

    they could be on the hook for this withholding tax.”
