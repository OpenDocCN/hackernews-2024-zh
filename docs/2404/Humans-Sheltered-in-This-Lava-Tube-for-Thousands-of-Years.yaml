    According to new research, ancient humans had at least two of those three needs
    met by a [nearly mile-long](http://vulcanospeleology.org/articles/jirsan.pdf)
    lava tube about 77 miles (125 kilometers) north of Medina, Saudi Arabia, for at
    least 7,000 years.'

- en: The lava tube in question is named Umm Jirsan, the longest of the lava tubes
    in Saudi Arabia’s volcanic field, Harrat Khaybar. Today, wolves, foxes, and snakes
    [inhabit](http://vulcanospeleology.org/articles/jirsan.pdf) the cave, but it was
    once a popular spot for human pastoralists and their domesticated animals. The
    new study, published today in the journal PLoS One, examined faunal remains and
    rock art in the region and adds to a growing body of research into the system.

    region, and one where organic material like bone and deeply layered sediments
    are much better preserved,” said Mathew Stewart, a zooarchaeologist at Griffith
    University in Australia and the study’s lead author, in an email to Gizmodo. “We
    had no expectations to find archaeology at Umm Jirsan. In fact, we were mostly
    interested in seeing the large caches of bones that had been previously reported.”

    that striped hyenas were creating bone caches in the back of the cave. There are
    hundreds of thousands of bones in Umm Jirsan, the team found, belonging to at
    least 40 species and dating from the Neolithic to as recently as the Victorian
    Era.

    Stewart told Gizmodo that animals have likely used the lava tubes since they formed,
    millions of years ago. Seven of the lava flows in Harrat Khaybar are less than
    1,500 years old, [according](https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=231060) to
    the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program, and the region still has
    the potential for activity, [according to a 2022 study](https://appliedvolc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13617-022-00124-z).

- en: In their new paper, the researchers reported evidence for human occupation of
    the lava tube between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age—in other words, humans
    made use of the tube for millennia. Isotopic analysis of the human remains in
    the cave revealed an increase of foods in their diet that had high levels of a
    certain isotope of carbon associated with oasis agriculture.

    Rather, they think it was a convenient spot for herders to stop and provide their
    flocks with shade and water. Based on human use of the surrounding area—evinced
    by nearby rock art and other faunal records—the team posited that the lava tube
    “was situated along a pastoral route linking key oases.” So you can think of Umm
    Jirsan more as an ancient truck stop than a place of residence.

    northeast of Umm Jirsan. The researchers reported 16 rock art panels depicting
    cattle, sheep, goats, and possibly ibexes.

    structure provided shelter for people and their herds for thousands of years.
    In the harsh desert environment, the promise of a break from the sun, wind, and
    heat would’ve made Umm Jirsan a perfect prehistoric pit stop.
