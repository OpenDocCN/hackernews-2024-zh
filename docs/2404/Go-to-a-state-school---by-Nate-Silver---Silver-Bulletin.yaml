    [support for gay marriage in the 2010s](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx).
    Gay marriage could be justified either on progressive grounds, since it created
    more rights for an historically marginalized group, or on conservative ones, since
    marriage is usually regarded as a stabilizing, conservative institution. Elite
    private colleges are both hotbeds of left-wing radicalism *and* are places of
    incredible wealth and privilege *and* have abandoned many of the [rigorous academic
    standards](https://www.slowboring.com/p/college-students-should-study-more) and
    [core principles like free speech](https://www.natesilver.net/p/free-speech-is-in-trouble)
    that got them there in the first place. [Leftists and liberals and conservatives](https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-liberalism-and-leftism-are-increasingly)  *all*
    have reasons to regard them with suspicion, even as being a little cringe.

  zh: 这也许不是你期待的类比，但在某些方面，公众对精英学院看法的急剧转变让我想起了2010年代对[同性婚姻支持的急剧转变](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx)。同性婚姻可以从进步的角度来进行辩护，因为它为历史上被边缘化的群体创造了更多权利，也可以从保守的角度来进行辩护，因为婚姻通常被视为一种稳定的、保守的制度。精英私立学院既是左翼激进主义的温床，又是极度财富和特权的地方，也放弃了许多使它们首次跻身于此的[严格学术标准](https://www.slowboring.com/p/college-students-should-study-more)和[像言论自由这样的核心原则](https://www.natesilver.net/p/free-speech-is-in-trouble)。[左派和自由派和保守派](https://www.natesilver.net/p/why-liberalism-and-leftism-are-increasingly)
    *都* 有理由怀疑它们，即使它们有点尴尬。
- en: So fuck Harvard and fuck the rest of these schools — the correction in perceptions
    is long overdue. By all means go if it’s in your best interest to do so. But state
    colleges and institutions are much better institutions for society — one of the
    things that truly [make America great](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/03/the-state-university-in-america/633818/)
    — and often offer a more well-rounded experience and a comparable education at
    a lower price.

  zh: 因此，去他妈的哈佛和这些学校的其余部分 —— 修正看法的时机已经迫在眉睫。如果符合你的最佳利益，那就尽管去吧。但州立学院和机构对社会来说是更好的机构之一
    —— 这是真正[让美国伟大的](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1891/03/the-state-university-in-america/633818/)事物之一
    —— 并且通常以更低的价格提供更全面的体验和可比较的教育。
