    genres. The number of *unique rhyme words* is among the top ten descriptors across
    all five genres analyzed. The *number of dots* and *repeated line ratio* descriptors
    are among the top descriptors in pop, rock, rap, and R&B. Four descriptors are
    featured in the top descriptors of three genres each (*ratio verses to sections*,
    *ratio choruses to sections*, *average token length*, *Dugast’s U* (modelling
    the number of token types as a function of the token count), and *blank line*
    count. Interestingly, when considering a higher abstraction level (i.e., descriptor
    categories such as lexical, emotion, structure, rhyme, readability, or diversity),
    we observe that lexical descriptors emerge as the predominant category across
    all five genres. Furthermore, at least one rhyme descriptor is also among the
    top descriptors for each genre. Four out of the five genres also feature at least
    one structural descriptor, while R&B does not. While for pop and rap, the top-10
    descriptors contain lexical, structural, diversity, and rhyme descriptors, rock
    features a readability descriptor. For country, five categories of descriptors
    are within the top 10\. Interestingly, descriptors measuring the lexical diversity
    of lyrics are among the top descriptors for rap and R&B (*Dugast’s U*; and Measure
    of Textual Lexical Diversity *MTLD* that captures the average length of sequential
    token strings that fulfil a type-token-ratio threshold), country (*compression
    ratio*, i.e., ratio of the size of zlib compressed lyrics compared to the original,
    uncompressed lyrics), and pop (*Dugast’s U*). Emotion descriptors only occur among
    the most important descriptors for country (*positive emotion*) and R&B (*positive
    emotions and anger*). Readability descriptors are among the top descriptors for
    rock (*Dale-Chall* readability score, which is computed based on a list of 3000
    words that fourth-graders should be familiar with).

    a robust regression model trained for each descriptor-genre combination; the resulting

    This further substantiates previous findings that lyrics are increasingly becoming

    The strongest such increase can be observed for *rap* (slope \(m = 0.002516\)),
    whereas the weakest increase is displayed by *country* (\(m = 0.000640\)). The
    *ratio of chorus to sections* descriptor behaves similarly across different genres.
    The values for this descriptor have increased for all five genres. This implies
    that the structure of lyrics is shifting towards containing more choruses than
    in the past, in turn contributing to higher repetitiveness of lyrics. We see the
    strongest growth in the values of this descriptor for *rap* (\(m = 0.008703\))
    and the weakest growth for *R&B* (\(m = 0.000325\)). The fact that the compression
    ratio descriptor (not shown in the figure) also shows an increase in all genres
    except R&B further substantiates the trend toward more repetitive lyrics. Another
    observation is that the lyrics seem to become more personal overall. The *pronoun
    frequency* is increasing for all genres except one (*country* with \(m = -0.000145\)).
    The strongest increase can be observed for *rap* (\(m = 0.000926\)), followed
    by *pop* (\(m = 0.000831\)), while *rock* (\(m = 0.000372\)) and *R&B* (\(m =
    0.000369\)) show a moderate increase. Furthermore, our analysis shows that lyrics
    have become angrier across all genres, with *rap* showing the most profound increase
    in *anger* (\(m = 0.015996\)). Similarly, the amount of *negative emotions* conveyed
    also increases across all genres. Again *rap* shows the highest increase (\(m
    = 0.021701\)), followed by *R&B* (\(m = 0.018663\)), while *country* shows the
    lowest increase (\(m = 0.000606\)). At the same time, we witness a decrease in
    *positive emotions* for *pop* (\(m = -0.020041\)), *rock* (\(m = -0.012124\)),
    *country* (\(m = -0.021662\)), and *R&B* (\(m = -0.048552\)), while *rap* shows
    a moderate increase (\(m = 0.000129\)).'

    with the highest average lyrics view count), is considered as the reference class
    of the dependent variable. Our results show that the probability of a song being
    from country or rock instead of rap, according to its *lyrics view count*, varies
    across decades. As *lyrics view count* increases, the effect of the year slightly
    augments (in 1.07 odds) the probability of a song being from country instead of
    from rap: \(\beta (SE)=0.07(0.02)\), \(z=3.29\), \(p=.0009\). Differently, as
    *lyrics view count* increases, the effect of a raising year decreases (in 0.94
    odds) the probability of a song being from rock instead of from rap: \(\beta (SE)=-0.05(0.01)\),
    \(z=-5.89\), \(p<.0001\). In other words, the lyrics of older rock songs are generally
    more popular than new ones in comparison to rap, and vice versa for country. This
    is visualized in Fig. [3](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Fig3), showing the estimated
    effects of the multinomial logistic regression model. The interaction between
    *lyrics view count* and *release year* did not show a significant effect for rap
    with respect to pop and R&B (cf. *date***popularity* for pop and R&B). Differently,
    for country and rock, the estimated regression coefficients are positive and negative,
    respectively (cf. *date***popularity* for country and rock). This shows that compared
    to rap, lyrics’ popularity increases over time for country, while decreasing for
    rock. The same analysis is performed considering *song listening count* instead
    of lyrics view count, i. e., we perform multinomial logistic regression considering
    *genre* as the dependent variable and the interaction between *listening count*
    and *release date* as predictors. This analysis shows that the *release date*
    does not affect the relationship between *listening count* and *genre*, as no
    significant effects are shown. While track listening counts do not show any effects,
    lyrics view counts do indeed show effects; suggesting that for some musical genres,
    fans’ interest in lyrics goes beyond their listening consumption. In other words,
    while the play counts for a given genre might not significantly differ, when it
    comes to the listeners’ interest in lyrics, clear patterns are displayed: rock
    fans mostly enjoy lyrics from older songs; country fans are more interested in
    new songs’ lyrics. However, the small determination coefficient of the multinomial
    logistic regression shows that the explanatory power of the model is limited;
    thus, documented significant p-values might partially result, due to the huge
    sample size, from random noise.'

    multiple linear regression performed for each genre are given. We find that for
    rap, the most variance of the release year (the dependent variable) can be explained
    by the predictors. \(32\%\) (i. e., \(R^{2}=0.32\)) of the variance in the release
    year for rap can be explained by the descriptors extracted from the lyrics. This
    is not surprising as rap, characterized by the use of semi-spoken rhymes, is a
    musical style that has grown in the context of practices marked by high-level
    linguistic competencies, such as competitive verbal games^([53](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#ref-CR53
    "Toop, D., Cheney, C. & Kajikawa, L. Rap. In New Grove Music online (Oxford music
    online).")). Indeed, among the evaluated musical genres, rap is the one in which
    lyrics play the most prominent role. The second genre for which a higher amount
    of variance in the release year is explained by the descriptors extracted from
    the lyrics is R&B (\(R^{2}=0.20\)). This might be explained, from a musicological
    perspective, by taking into account the relationship between R&B and other musical
    genres. For instance, R&B was simplified concerning the lyrics (besides the music)
    by eliminating adult-related themes and topics^([54](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#ref-CR54
    "Rye, H. Rhythm-and-blues. In New Grove Music online (Oxford music online).")).
    As such, it was a precursor to the development of rock-and-roll, which explains
    the higher importance of lyrics in modeling the evolution of R&B with respect
    to rock. Note that although we utilize R&B as a general musical genre, other terms
    subsequently introduced relating to R&B, such as *soul*, are also considered under
    the umbrella of R&B. This is particularly important as we investigate music released
    in more recent decades (1990–2020) with respect to the time when the term R&B
    was originally coined. At the same time, it highlights the importance of historically
    contextualizing the musical genres assessed in the comparison, since beyond their
    intrinsic characteristics (e. g., lyrics having a central role in rap), also their
    heterogeneous nature, in this case, R&B being more heterogeneous than rock e.g.,
    blues and funk being highly repetitive, while soul has undergone substantial changes
    and is now lyrically in pop song form), might also have an impact in the role
    played by lyrics. For pop, rock, and country, the amount of variance in release
    date explained by the predictors is lower than for rap and R&B, with an \(R^{2}\)
    value of 0.09 for pop and rock, 0.11 for country. This indicates that, unlike
    rap, and to some extent R&B, lyrics might not be a very meaningful indicator of
    the development of other musical genres.

    the complexity and difficulty of the lyrics seem to decrease with time for some
    musical genres. Concerning complexity, this is displayed by the positive \(\beta\)
    for *compression ratio* (essentially capturing the repeatability of lyrics) shown
    by rap (cf. \(\beta = 0.70\) in Table [4](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Tab4)).
    This indicates that rap lyrics become easier to comprehend over time, something
    that can be interpreted as a sign of increasing repetitiveness and, therefore,
    simplicity. However, the opposite trend is shown for R&B (cf. \(\beta = -0.96\),
    in Table [4](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Tab4)), which suggests that the simplification
    over time might depend on the musical genre; indeed, this descriptor is not relevant
    neither for pop nor rock nor country. The decline in lyrics’ difficulty observed
    over time for rap is confirmed by the negative \(\beta\) for *Simple Measure of
    Gobbledygook* (SMOG) readability measure (in a sample of 30 sentences, words with
    three or more syllables are counted and used to compute the final SMOG score).
    This indicates a detriment in complexity concerning the lyric’s readability (cf. \(\beta
    = -0.57\) in Table [4](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Tab4)). The increase in readability
    over time is also confirmed for rock, as shown by the positive slope for  *Dale-Chall*

    the total number of unique terms) on a log scale), shown for all the genres except
    country, pop, and rock (for which this descriptor is not included in the model
    as it did not show a significant contribution), which indicates that vocabulary
    richness decreases with time (cf. negative \(\beta\) for *Maas* in Table [4](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Tab4)).
    As already mentioned, step-wise backward elimination is used to find the best-fitting
    model for each musical genre. The trend toward simplicity over time can also be
    observed in the structure, which shows a decrease in the *number of sections*,
    most prominently shown for R&B and rock (cf. \(\beta = -0.72\) and \(\beta = -0.79\),
    respectively in Table 4); as well as a general increment (except for country)
    in the ratio between verses to chorus and verses to sections (cf. positive \(\beta\) for *ratio
    verses to sections* and *ratio chorus to sections* in Table [4](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#Tab4)).
    Similarly, the results for rhyme-related descriptors further confirm the tendency
    towards simpler lyrics over time for all musical genres. This is particularly
    shown by the increment of the *rhyme percent* in rap in R&B (cf. \(\beta = 1.20\) and\(\beta
    = 0.68\), respectively) and by a detriment in the number of rhyme words (cf. negative \(\beta\) for
    all the genres), which shows a decline in the rhymes’ variety over time. However,
    for block-wise predictors, slightly higher adjusted R\(^{2}\) for structure and

    be interpreted cautiously, and taken as tendencies rather than strong differences

    They speculate that this might also be related to how music is consumed, technological
    innovation, or the fact that music is mostly listened to in the background. As
    for RQ2 (Which role does the popularity of songs and lyrics play in this scenario?),
    we conclude that while song listening counts do not show any effects, lyrics view
    counts do indeed show effects. This suggests that for rap, rock, and country,
    lyrics play a more pronounced role than for other genres and that listeners’ interest
    in lyrics goes beyond musical consumption itself.'

    the nature and history of these platforms, in particular last.fm, the studied

    bias*, while last.fm does not release official statistics of their users, research
    studies conducted on large amounts of publicly available demographic and listening

    which investigates user-generated music consumption data, are therefore valid
    only for this particular subset of music listeners. Also directly related to our
    data sources, and, particularly, the Genius platform is the genre information
    used in our analyses. Annotators and editors on the Genius platform may assign
    one of six high-level genres and an arbitrary number of so-called secondary tags
    (i.e., subgenres) to each song. The alignment of genre and subgenre assignments
    is quality-checked by the community, no genre hierarchy is used to check the validity
    of the genre and subgenre assignments, which can introduce malformed genre assignments.'

    view counts are prone to *popularity bias*. More precisely, these counts for songs
    released before the emergence of the platforms (2002 and 2009, respectively, for
    last.fm and Genius) underestimate the true frequencies of listening and lyrics
    viewing. On the one hand, this is due to the platforms’ demographic structure
    of users (see above); but also because a majority of vinyl and cassette (and even
    some CD) releases have never found their way into these digital online platforms.
    This kind of popularity bias in our investigated data might have significantly
    influenced the trends identified for the 1970s to 2000s. However, only Analysis 2
    might have been affected by this since popularity estimates are not used in Analysis 1\.
    And even for Analysis 2, popularity values are Z-score normalized, which to some
    extent accounts for this kind of bias. Still, it should also be pointed out that
    the randomization strategy might have led to a sampling bias in terms of popularity.
    This might have partly affected the results, eventually introducing a bias for
    the genres pop and country, which due to the mentioned limitation, should be taken
    particularly cautiously.

    overcome by resorting to other data sources, notably the often-used Billboard
    Charts. However, using this data would introduce other distortions, among others,
    a highly US-centric view of the world, a much more limited sample size, and a
    lower granularity of the popularity figures (only ranks instead of play counts).
    In addition, Billboard Charts are only indicative of music consumption, not for
    lyrics viewing, which we particularly study in this paper.

    This choice had to be made to ensure a language-coherent sample of songs and,
    consequently, the comparability of results. While some of the descriptors could
    have been computed for other languages as well, due to the different characteristics
    of languages (e.g., different lexical structures), a cross-language comparison
    of the descriptors would not be meaningful. Also, most of the resources required
    to compute the readability scores and emotional descriptors are only available
    for English. Here we note that for assessing the readability of texts, we rely
    on rather simple metrics. For instance, difficult words are defined as words with
    three or more syllables. We also note that some of the readability metrics rely
    on sentences, which might not always be directly extractable from lyrics. Nevertheless,
    in future work, we could include more languages and conduct analyses on songs
    within each language class on a limited set of suited descriptors.

    a further limitation of this work. These changes are shown, for instance, by the

    in streaming revenue in the last two decades. This not only changed, for instance,
    the number of songs on an album as this was physically restricted on vinyl or
    CDs, but also the way songs are sequenced^([59](/articles/s41598-024-55742-x#ref-CR59

    On streaming platforms, a song is considered consumed if it is played for at least
    30 seconds. Hence, artists aim to start their songs with easily identifiable melodies
    and lyrics.
