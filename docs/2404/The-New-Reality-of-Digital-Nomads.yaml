- en: 'Digital nomadism has been on the rise, but the implications of this trend go
    far beyond post-pandemic location flexibility and remote work. A cultural shift
    is taking place in developed countries that sees swaths of people becoming disillusioned
    with the lure of the “good life” available to prior generations. Digital nomadism
    offers an alternative path away from expensive, long-term mortgages and a raft
    of possessions and instead opens the door for people to maximize their income
    by living in countries with low costs of living. Amid all of this change, the
    implications for brand strategy and consumers are not yet well understood. The
    authors’ research identified three major trends that are reshaping consumer behavior
    and that present significant opportunities for brands: The end of rootedness and
    need for flexibility; the need for new infrastructures and services that cater
    to nomadic living; and the possibility of shaping the discourse around new values
    and lifestyles.  <content js-target="article-content" data-key="VFPuvj139jyH1bAxrvwTy473udLh9uL/yzBZTGQggAOjbMh3YvBWiTuHD5frR2J/"

    nomadism — a lifestyle where one leverages remote work to travel and live in varying,
    often affordable locations around the world — has been steadily on the rise, attracting
    not only tech-savvy workers, but everyone from families with children to retirees.
    In one survey, over 17 million American workers identified as digital nomads,
    [an increase of 131% from 2019](https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/digital-nomads/),
    and they included [workers](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/04/digital-nomads-work-remotely-tech-visas)
    from a wide array of professions. This rise has also been fueled by the ease of
    obtaining [digital nomad visas](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2022/07/17/why-the-digital-nomad-lifestyle-is-on-the-rise/?sh=3990cfbb4934)
