    or defend the product. The situation escalated when one Facebook user replied:
    “Stop spoiling my brother’s product. If [you] don’t like it, use another one than
    bring it to social media or call customer service.” Okoli responded: “Help me
    advise your brother to stop ki***ing people with his product, yesterday was my

    as she attended a church near her home on 24 September and detained until the
    following day. She was then flown to the Nigerian Police Force’s headquarters
    in the capital, Abuja, and detained for another 24 hours, before being released
    on bail. It is unclear why Okoli was taken to Abuja, given both she and Erisco
    are based in Lagos, and the police did not respond to openDemocracy’s request
    for answers.

    that he had stood as bail guarantor for Okoli after being contacted by one of
    her aunties, who, like him, is from Anambra state. In the interview, he claimed
    Erisco’s founder and CEO, Eric Umeofia, had been in the police headquarters while
    Okoli wrote the apology, and accused Okoli of absconding to Lagos after her release
    and failing to return to the police station in Abuja after seven days to explain
    how the matter was resolved – which had been a condition of her bail. Okoli’s
    counsel, Inibehe Effiong [denied](https://fij.ng/article/pro-erisco-guarantor-claims-chioma-okoli-betrayed-him-by-jumping-bail/)
    Okoli absconded and claimed she had been “forced” to write “the so-called letter
    of apology”.

    Mix were safe for consumption. The following week, police charged Okoli with two
    counts of “instigating people against Erisco Foods Limited, knowing the said information
    to be false”, and [accused her](https://twitter.com/policeng/status/1765699292696592654?s=46)
    of violating “some salient parts” of the Cybercrime Act.

    the police on Okoli’s behalf, arguing that her right to personal liberty was violated
    by being unlawfully detained for more than 24 hours without charge. The lawsuit
    also wants the company and the police to “publish an unreserved written apology”
    to Okoli in three national newspapers and on Erisco’s Facebook page.

    Speaking to openDemocracy, he said Okoli should be the one claiming defamation
    because Umeofia, Erisco’s CEO, has “called her a criminal on national TV, accused
    her of belonging to a criminal syndicate, and accused her of blackmail.”
