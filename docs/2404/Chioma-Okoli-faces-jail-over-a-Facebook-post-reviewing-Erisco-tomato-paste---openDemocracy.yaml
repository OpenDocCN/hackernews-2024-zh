    following day. She was then flown to the Nigerian Police Force’s headquarters
    in the capital, Abuja, and detained for another 24 hours, before being released
    on bail. It is unclear why Okoli was taken to Abuja, given both she and Erisco
    are based in Lagos, and the police did not respond to openDemocracy’s request

    her aunties, who, like him, is from Anambra state. In the interview, he claimed
    Erisco’s founder and CEO, Eric Umeofia, had been in the police headquarters while
    Okoli wrote the apology, and accused Okoli of absconding to Lagos after her release
    and failing to return to the police station in Abuja after seven days to explain
    how the matter was resolved – which had been a condition of her bail. Okoli’s
    counsel, Inibehe Effiong [denied](https://fij.ng/article/pro-erisco-guarantor-claims-chioma-okoli-betrayed-him-by-jumping-bail/)
    Okoli absconded and claimed she had been “forced” to write “the so-called letter

    Eric Umeofia在警察总部时，Okoli写了道歉信，并指责Okoli在获释后逃到拉各斯，并未在阿布贾的警察局满七天后返回解释事情的解决情况，这是她保释的条件之一。Okoli的辩护律师Inibehe
    Effiong [否认](https://fij.ng/article/pro-erisco-guarantor-claims-chioma-okoli-betrayed-him-by-jumping-bail/)
    Okoli逃跑，并声称她被“迫”写下了“所谓的道歉信”。

    Mix were safe for consumption. The following week, police charged Okoli with two

    Speaking to openDemocracy, he said Okoli should be the one claiming defamation

    her of belonging to a criminal syndicate, and accused her of blackmail.”
