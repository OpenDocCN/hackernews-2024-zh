["```\n> Not only did you sell out, you also removed all the old versions that were released under an open source license so that others couldn't continue to use out-of-support versions.\n\n`@nut-tree/plugin-ocr` has never been publicly available, nor was any other of the paid addons that were released after introducing non-free addons **almost 2.5 years ago**.\n\n> You should do a better job updating your documentation so that people do not waste their time like I did. This change to closed source was announced where, exactly? All of your READMEs and documentation sites do not mention this\n\nThis is mentioned on the nutjs.dev landing page and e.g. [pricing page](https://nutjs.dev/pricing/pricing). The core readme refers to the website for additional information, so I’d say it’s fair enough to expect people to actually read it.\n\n> tl;dr get off GitHub and npm entirely if you want to do the closed-source thing, kthx.\n\nIt was a pleasure to meet you, have a great day! \n```"]
