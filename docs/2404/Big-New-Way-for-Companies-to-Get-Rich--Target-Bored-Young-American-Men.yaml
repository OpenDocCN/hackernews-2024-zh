    years is stunning. Americans legally bet a record $119.84 billion on sports in
    2023, up from $93 billion in 2022\. Since the Supreme Court in 2018 struck down
    a federal law prohibiting sports gambling, more than three dozen states have embraced
    it in some form. Seven states have also legalized iGaming, meaning online blackjack,
    roulette, and slot machines.
