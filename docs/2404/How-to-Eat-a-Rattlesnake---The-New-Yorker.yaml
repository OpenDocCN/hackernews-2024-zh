    country participles like “brang” were tantamount to slurs. I was a soft boy who
    spent most of my time indoors, leafing through Mom’s glossy magazines or choreographing
    dances with my sister to the theme song of “Three’s Company.” Well-meaning adults
    pushed me toward an array of alternative activities: sports of all kinds, hunting,
    shooting guns, driving A.T.V.s. As it turned out, I was totally lacking whatever
    instinct propelled other little boys toward breaking rules and bones. Instead,
    I ended up engaged in the most perilous sport of all: being a pansy in rural America.
    At home and at school, I racked up quite the list of nicknames, including crybaby,
    sissy, fairy, or—as I was known to telemarketers who called on the landline—“Ma’am.”'

    boots and a short-sleeved shirt with sunglasses tucked into the front pocket.
    He was unusually tall for a Hernandez sibling, just over six feet, with salt-and-pepper
    hair. My sister and I would put on sneakers and follow him to his pickup truck
    and the adventures, for better or for worse, would begin. “If you fall, fall to
    the left!” he would shout, as we teetered across a concrete dam in a wildlife
    refuge, with water on one side of us and a long fall on the other. “Don’t make
    any sudden moves!” he’d command, when a herd of bison set upon his truck as my
    sister and I clung to each other in the open bed. “Eh, it’s nothing,” he’d say

    blood seeped from a gash in his leg.

    us decorative gourds that he’d painted himself, inlaid with delicate pine-needle
    stitching that he’d done while watching basketball on TV. He was the darkest-skinned

    rides—runtish roller coasters and a swinging Viking ship—as well as a competition
    for the best-dressed cowboy and cowgirl. But these were hardly the main draw.
    For fans of the Western diamondback rattlesnake, this was Woodstock. Craft booths
    sold snakeskin boots, saddles, wallets, and belts. Uncle John bought me a keychain
    fashioned out of a rattlesnake head, which seemed to both of us the height of
    fashion. The star attraction was the so-called snake pit, inside an old saloon,
    where the creatures were exhibited before being skinned.

- en: The Western diamondback rattlesnake is among the most dangerous snakes in the
    United States. Named for the signature zigzag pattern of its skin, it is aggressive
    and known to stand its ground against predators and intruders. It can detect body
    heat and has excellent aim. Its venom is hemotoxic, attacking the blood. In some
    sense, though, the creature could be considered unusually gracious. Its rattle
    serves as an audible warning system. Anyone seeking to handle a rattlesnake must
    brazenly disregard this evolutionary “fuck off” feature, and for what? As Anthony
    Felder, Jr., an Oklahoma rattlesnake wrangler who was hospitalized with bites
    on three separate occasions before being fatally bitten, in 2016, aptly summed
    it up, “I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane once, so why wouldn’t I play

    Felder, Jr.）所说，在2016年，他作为俄克拉荷马州的响尾蛇驯养者，曾在三次不同的场合被咬伤送进医院，最终被致命咬伤，“我曾经从一架完好无损的飞机上跳下来，那么为什么我不和响尾蛇玩玩呢？”

    an area near the panhandle that’s mysterious even to Okies, the snake pit is known
    as “the Den of Death.” The town of Okeene touts itself as the originator of the
    so-called rattlesnake roundup, the name of the hunting events where snakes are
    collected. The roundups began as a way for ranchers to protect their cattle. They
    would go out, shoot as many rattlesnakes as they could, then nail the limp bodies
    to the sides of their wagons and roll into town to display their spoils. In Sweetwater,
    Texas, where the largest annual rattlesnake roundup is held today, amateurs can
    join in the hunts for a small fee.

    Mating season, birthing season, and hunting season were dictated by the dispassionate
    rhythms of the natural world. Rattlesnake hunting, in contrast, astounded me with
    its total lack of utility. Despite decades of roundups, the snake population remains
    substantial, and, besides, snake attacks aren’t common or fatal enough to warrant
    yearly culls. The creatures certainly don’t provide much in the way of nourishment.
    Even the scrawniest birds offer different cuts of meat to choose from, whereas
    the meat of a rattlesnake is confined to a single, skinny loin running down either
    side of the spine. The extremities of the creature are dramatically inedible,
    the rattle being made of keratin, the same material as human fingernails, and
    the head being where the venom is stored. Hunting them, handling them, eating
    them: it was all pure theatre, a rugged and risky masculine burlesque. The meat
    was a trophy, edible proof that you’d been willing to tangle with death.'

    red, a haughty curl in his lower lip, he now seemed determined to convey an air

    guys to prove their manhood. I intended to remain as unobtrusive as possible until

    Elk Mountain, a popular spot in the wildlife refuge close to my parents’ house.
    On the trail, we happened upon a mass of reddish-brown fur, which poked up its

    reminders that they are the largest land mammals in North America. Tourists pull
