    was written, near as I can tell, to satisfy the concerns of a small group of people
    who believe widespread diffusion of AI constitutes an existential risk to humanity.
    It contains references to hypothetical models that autonomously engage in illegal
    activity causing tens of millions in damage and model weights that “escape” from
    data centers—the stuff of science fiction, codified in law.'

    documentation and under penalty of perjury, that their models do not have a “hazardous
    capability,” either autonomously or at the behest of humans. The problem is that
    it is very hard to guarantee that a general-purpose tool *won’t *be used for nefarious
    purposes, especially because it’s hard to define what “used” means in this context.
    If I use GPT-4 to write a phishing email against an urban wastewater treatment
    plan, does that count? Under this bill, quite possibly so.

    computers would not be used for serious crimes, would they have been willing to
    sign with potential jail time on the line? Would they have even bothered to found
    Apple?

    to monitor and have the means to shut off a user’s access, the bill could make
    it nearly impossible to open-source models at the current AI frontier—much less
    the frontiers of tomorrow.
