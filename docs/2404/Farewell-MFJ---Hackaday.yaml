- en: We were sad to hear that after 52 years in operation, iconic ham radio supplier
    MFJ will close next month. On the one hand, it is hard not to hear such news and
    think that it is another sign that ham radio isn’t in a healthy space. After all,
    in an ideal world, [Martin Jue] — the well-known founder of MFJ — would have found
    an anxious buyer. Not only is the MFJ line of ham radio gear well regarded, but
    [Martin] had bought other ham radio-related companies over the years, such as
    Ameritron, Hygain, Cushcraft, Mirage, and Vectronics. Now, they will all be gone,
    too.

  zh: 我们听到消息感到很难过，传奇的无线电供应商MFJ经营了52年后将在下个月关闭。从一方面来说，听到这样的消息，我们很难不认为这是无线电业不健康的又一迹象。毕竟，在理想的情况下，[马丁·朱]——MFJ著名的创始人——本应该找到一个急需收购的买家。MFJ的无线电设备系列不仅享有很高的声誉，而且[马丁]多年来还收购了其他一些与无线电有关的公司，如Ameritron、Hygain、Cushcraft、Mirage和Vectronics。现在，它们也将全部消失。
- en: 'However, on a deeper reflection, maybe we shouldn’t see it as another nail
    in ham radio’s coffin. It is this way in every industry. There was a time when
    it was hard to imagine ham radio without, say, Heathkit. Yet they left, and the
    hobby continued. We could name a slew of other iconic companies that had their
    day: Eico, Hammarlund, Hallicrafters, and more. They live on at hamfests, their
    product lines are frozen in time, and we’re sure we’ll see a used market for MFJ
    gear well into the next century.'

  zh: 然而，更深入地反思，也许我们不应将其视为无线电业的又一损失。每个行业都是如此。曾经有段时间，很难想象无线电业没有希思基特（Heathkit）。然而，他们离开了，但这项爱好仍在延续。我们可以列举一些其他标志性公司：Eico、Hammarlund、Hallicrafters等等。它们在无线电展销会上依然存在，它们的产品线停留在时间的凝固点上，我们相信在未来的一个世纪里，MFJ的设备二手市场依然会存在。
- en: Maybe you aren’t a ham and wonder why you would care. Turns out MFJ made things
    of interest to anyone who worked with RF transmitting or receiving. If you were
    a shortwave listener, they had antennas and related gear for you. They also made
    antenna analyzers and network analyzers that were very cost-effective compared
    to other options. If you wanted clean power supplies, MFJ had quite the selection
    of those. They even had a great selection of variable capacitors and inductors,
    which are tough to find in small quantities. You could even get air-wound coil
    stock, knobs, meters, and toroids.

  zh: 也许你不是无线电爱好者，你可能会想知道为什么会在意。事实证明，MFJ制造的东西对任何与射频传输或接收有关的人都很有吸引力。如果你是短波收听者，他们有适合你的天线和相关设备。他们还制造了非常经济实惠的天线分析仪和网络分析仪。如果你需要干净的电源供应器，MFJ有相当多的选择。他们甚至提供大量小批量难以找到的可变电容器和电感器。你甚至可以获取空气绕组线圈、旋钮、仪表和磁环。
- en: Sure, most of what they sold was things only hams or other radio operators wanted—that
    was the nature of the company. But their loss will be felt by more than just the
    ham community. Someone, of course, will step into the void as they always do.

  zh: 当然，他们销售的大多数产品只有无线电爱好者或其他电台操作员才会感兴趣——这是公司的本质。但他们的关闭将不仅仅对无线电社区产生影响。毫无疑问，总会有人填补空缺，这一直如此。
- en: So farewell MFJ. We will miss you, but we look forward to meeting your replacement,
    whoever that might be. While you can spend a lot of money on ham radio, you [can
    get started for $50 or less](https://hackaday.com/tag/the-50-ham/). Oddly, we
    haven’t directly featured much MFJ gear on Hackaday over the years, but we have
    [mentioned a few](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/07/raspberry-pi-ham-radio-remote-reviewed/).

  zh: 因此，再见了MFJ。我们会想念你，但我们期待着见到你的继任者，不管是谁。虽然你可以在无线电上花费很多钱，但你可以[以50美元或更少的价格开始](https://hackaday.com/tag/the-50-ham/)。奇怪的是，多年来我们在Hackaday上并没有直接介绍过太多MFJ的设备，但我们确实[提到过一些](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/07/raspberry-pi-ham-radio-remote-reviewed/)。
