- en: This is a compendium of my favorite tricks I’ve come across in all my time doing
    this site. Most of them are not my own, but by people far more clever than me.
    Here I’m showcasing them and explaining the trick as I see it. While perhaps some
    of them are more “useful” than others, there is a lot to learn from all of them,
    whether you ever use the technique directly or not.
