    Concerns about [nuclear waste storage](https://grist.org/cities/smaller-reactors-may-still-have-a-big-nuclear-waste-problem/)
    and safety, particularly in the wake of the 1979 [Three Mile Island reactor meltdown](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html)
    in Pennsylvania, helped spur the retirement of nuclear power plants across the
    country. Nuclear energy’s proponents, however, counter that nuclear power has
    historically been among the [safest forms of power generation](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy),
    and that the consistent carbon-free energy it generates makes it an essential
    tool in the fight against global warming.

    project that’s reaching completion near Waynesboro, Georgia, where the second
    in a pair of new nuclear reactors is scheduled to enter commercial service at
    some point over the next three months. Each reactor has the capacity to [power

    first U.S. nuclear reactors built from scratch in decades — was a yearslong saga
    whose delays and budget overruns drove the giant nuclear company Westinghouse
    into bankruptcy. The reactors, first approved by Georgia regulators in 2009, are
    reckoned to be the most expensive infrastructure project of any kind in American
    history, at a total cost of $35 billion. That’s nearly double the original budget
    of the project, which is set to cross the finish line seven years behind schedule.
    Much of the cost was ultimately borne by Georgia residents, whose energy bills
    have ballooned to pay off a portion of the overruns.

    nuclear, if we can do it, is a valuable contribution to the system, but we need
    to learn how to do it cheaper than we’ve done so far. I would hate to throw away
    all the gains that we’ve learned from doing it.”

    simple argument: Because the new reactors were the first newly built American
    nuclear plant to come online since 1993 — and the first to begin construction
    since the 1970s — many of their challenges were either unique to a first-of-a-kind
    reactor design or a result of the loss of industrial knowledge since the decline
    of the nuclear industry. Therefore, they might not necessarily recur in a future
    project, which could take advantage of the finalized reactor design and the know-how
    that had to be generated from scratch during Vogtle.'

    reactor model, known as an AP1000, had never before been built. (It was Westinghouse’s
    flagship model, combining massive generation capacity with new “passive safety”
    features, which allow reactors to remain cooled and safe without human intervention,
    external power, or emergency generators in the case of an accident.) It later
    emerged that the reactor’s developer, Westinghouse, [had not even fully completed
    the design before starting construction](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2017/10/23/Westinghouse-sold-an-unfinished-product-then-the-problems-snowballed/stories/201710290008),

    news for Georgians, it could mean a smoother path ahead for future reactors.

    that Congress passed in 2022, any new nuclear reactor would receive somewhere
    between 30 and 50 percent of its costs back in tax credits.

    utility commissions. Many ratepayer advocates accuse these commissions of effectively
    rubber-stamping utility demands as a result of regulatory capture — at the expense
    of customers who are unable to choose a different power company. But this same
    dynamic means that vertically integrated utilities are in the best position to
    build something as expensive as a nuclear plant.
