    on Monday night Lina Khan, boss of the Federal Trade Commission, was on the Daily
    Show recounting how the agency is going after Amazon, Facebook and others over
    monopolistic practices. She also got evidence of her *persona non grata* status
    with Cook & Co.

    Jon Stewart, with cheers from the crowd - again not something many US government
    officials hear. The exception to this is possibly Rob Joyce, the former White
    House cybersecurity coordinator and recently [retired](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3681065/national-security-agency-announces-retirement-of-cybersecurity-director/)

    tree lights for fun.

    1,200 staff and Amazon has "monopoly money," and can throw ten times that number
    of lawyers at the case. "We're pretty out-gunned but not out-matched," she asserted.

    defeat Instagram and WhatsApp, so just bought them, she asserted.

    the industry (*cough*, Microsoft in the 1990s), customers are still shafted if

    to this humble vulture that this free-market nation is anything but in so many
    areas. Though it depends on where one lives, good luck getting a decent, healthy
    choice of ISP or cellphone carrier. And for a region that is a major tech hub
    of America the internet speeds and prices came as a rude shock.

    This hack may have been somewhat terse with a Verizon staffer trying to tell me
    that paying for text messages (an engineering function that carries the most minimal
    of data loads) was cheap at the price of just $5 a month. But with so little choice
    such predatory pricing is possible.

    monopolistic practices, and it's about time. Frankly it's insane that an agency
    with such an important role in ensuring fair and open markets has such tiny staffing
    levels and funding.

    figures involved as a proportion of current profit, to give some perspective.
    When the FTC imposed a $5bn fine on Facebook back in 2019 over the [Cambridge
    Analytica scandal](https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/12/ftc_facebook_settlement_proposal/),
    for example, that amounted to one percent of its market cap. Zuckerberg must have
