- en: Sabine Hossenfelder today posted [a new video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKiBlGDfRU8)
    which everyone in theoretical physics should watch and think seriously about.
    She tells honestly in detail the story of her career and experiences in academia,
    explaining very clearly exactly what the problems are with the conventional system
    for funding research and for training postdocs.

    she decided she needed to move back to Germany and applied for a grant to fund
    her research (I believe for [this project](https://fias.institute/en/projects/analoge-gravitation-in-dualen-systemen/)).
    This is how she describes the situation:'

    get the money. And that’s what I did. I applied for grants on research projects
    because it was a way to make money, not because I thought it would leave an impact
    in the history of science. It’s not that what I did was somehow wrong. It was,
    and still is, totally state of the art. I did what I said I’d do in the proposal,
    I did the calculation, I wrote the paper, I wrote my reports, and the reports
    were approved. Normal academic procedure.

    bullshit and just as most of academic research that your taxes pay for is almost
    certainly bullshit. The real problem I had, I think, is that I was bad at lying
    to myself. Of course, I’d try to tell myself and anyone who was willing to listen
    that at least unofficially on the side I would do the research that I thought
    was worth my time but that I couldn’t get money for because it was too far off
    the mainstream. But that research never got done because I had to do the other
    stuff that I actually got paid for.

    on research that she found to be more promising and not bullshit, but those grant
    proposals were not successful. Since then, she has left the academic research
    system and concentrated on trying to make a career oriented around high-quality
    Youtube videos about scientific research.

- en: 'It seems to me that Hossenfelder correctly analyzes the source of her difficulties:
    “The real problem I had, I think, is that I was bad at lying to myself.” Those
    more successful in the academic system sometimes criticize her as someone just
    not as talented as themselves at recognizing and doing good research work. But
    I see quite the opposite in her story. Many of those successfully pursuing a research
    career in this area differ from her in either not being smart enough to recognize
    bullshit, or not being honest enough to do anything about it when they do recognize
    bullshit.'
