["```\nFinancial payback period for 3000W\nSystem cost : $1,124 on Amazon in 2024\nYearly energy creation: 365d * 4.26hsun/d * 1.280kW = 2,000kWh/y (but more like 1,000kWh/year after losses)\nYearly value creation: 1,000kWh/y * $0.55/kWh in SF = $550/y energy created\n100W system payback period: $1,124 / $550 = 2 years until payback \n```"]
