## My Boiler

The My Boiler app can be used to explore the performance of a boiler including, fuel input, electricity consumption, heat output, efficiency and system temperatures.

**Auto configure:** This app can auto-configure connecting to emoncms feeds with the names shown on the right, alternatively feeds can be selected by clicking on the edit button.

**Cumulative kWh** feeds can be created from power feeds using the power_to_kwh input processor, which converts power data (measured in watts) into energy consumption data (measured in kWh).

**Share publicly:** Check the "public" check box if you want to share your dashboard publicly, and ensure that the associated feeds are also made public by adjusting their settings on the feeds page.

**Start date:** To modify the start date for cumulative total fuel and electricity consumption, heat output and efficiency, input a unix timestamp corresponding to your desired starting date and time.
