    each day still feel like a miracle, a surprise party just for me. The art is piled
    neatly between empty frames, matboards, sheets of glass, foamboard, giant vinyl
    portfolios. I turn the pieces over one by one, each a puzzle. Glass, paint, wood,
    canvas, paper, ink, cardboard, silk, wire, tape, staples. Dog hair. Legos. A golf
    ball. A recently filed legal brief—just a little stapled booklet—for a federal
    case about protecting immigrants’ rights. (The young attorney who brought it in explained
    when I asked, his face full of pride.) A century-old studio portrait of a small
    boy in a sailor suit, smiling out from under his bangs, taken the year before
    he died, a faded note handwritten on the back: *The brother I never knew*. I use
    my phone to take a snapshot of these words. Later on my computer I’ll enhance
    it, print it out, then slide it into an acid-free sleeve to be taped onto the
    finished piece’s back, as the customer requested. The original note will remain,
    too—sealed safely and invisibly inside the frame. Maybe for another hundred years.'

    Illinois, a Chicago suburb known for Northwestern University and the Mitchell
    Museum of the American Indian, for its commitment to social justice and the arts.
    As in most places, that commitment often fails when it meets reality, but still,
    Evanston is fierce and beautiful where you least expect it.

    famous Absolut vodka bottle, his signature scrawled at the bottom. A dentist’s
    certificate of appreciation for his work caring for “the oral health of Holocaust
    survivors.” An orange cartoon brontosaurus riding a tiny scooter through downtown
    Chicago. A pack of fierce-faced bicyclists racing along a cliff, in an advertisement
    for the 1953 Tour de France. Director John Waters grinning in his favorite pink
    Comme des Garçons jacket (“that looks like your aunt’s bedspread with the little
    balls on it,” he told *GQ*). A tasseled table-runner from Turkey, a Dave Chappelle
    poster, a disintegrating page from a 1904 Chicago newspaper found under someone’s
    bathroom floor during a renovation. Lots of Phish posters. An anonymous, headless
    female nude painted all in rich, egg-yolk yellow. An 1871 textbook illustration
    of a uterus embellished with flowers. A Japanese golfer painted in broad calligraphic
    black brushstrokes. A cowboy in full dress, rodeo number pinned to his back, standing
    on a diving board over a swimming pool. A child’s felt-scrap collage. Autographed
    photos of Billie Jean King, James Brown. An Alaskan indigenous formline hummingbird,
    a Hebrew mandala, a Frank Lloyd Wright window. An aerial view of Machu Picchu,
    glowing gold and black against a bright orange sky, as if the whole world is on
    fire.

    works in the basement building frames, and the only other employee works mostly
    on days I don’t. When customers come in, I can’t look up at them right away anyhow
    because I’m handling glass or razor blades or using some sharp tool I never knew
    the name of until now. (For the first time in my life, I own an awl, a sleek little
    wooden-handled model sheathed in clear vinyl. My boss gave it to me, said to keep
    it secret, write my name on it. This felt ceremonious, initiatory, though I think
    he just wants all our awls to quit disappearing.)

    from the band’s 1973 German tour; Tom Tom Club’s Tina Weymouth standing naked

    where I hoped to spend my entire adult life, writing and teaching and teaching
    writing. I planned never to return. Chicago was cold. My parents were difficult
    and made mistakes. In North Carolina, I lived at the actual beach. I won awards,
    I published books, I got tenure—I showed everybody, didn’t I? I got cancer; I
    recovered, surrounded by friends. I survived hurricanes.

    did they. They were busy birdwatching, attending new plays, trying new restaurants.
    Our relationship had mellowed and warmed with time. But then my father, my sweet,
    strong, and only father—he began to die, and then he died. Words that still don’t
    sound true five years later, as I type them here.

    to lose hers. She fell, and didn’t remember falling. She said she never fell,
    and if she did, she certainly wasn’t going to tell anyone. She had no family left
    in Chicago. She agreed to move into Memory Care. I decided to move back north.

    maybe I’m imagining that.

    the front, a bad mistake. The frame had to be rebuilt. I arrived at work the next
    day to find twenty identical manufactured frames from Target or Walmart, allegedly
    brought in by a customer who wanted only new hangers installed on the backs. A
    strange order. I spent the day drilling forty holes, installing forty screws,
    twisting forty wires. My hands hurt for a week.

    friends. Momentum, focus. While I’m cleaning glass, inspecting endlessly for specks
    of dust or lint, using a marker to cover a flea-sized chip on a frame, time falls
    away. Everything outside the moment falls away, like a blurred background in an
    Impressionist landscape. No, I don’t want lunch, no I don’t want to sit down.

    of wooden moulding, joining corners with a compressor-powered pneumatic machine
    that seems to breathe on its own. It’s dark and dungeony down there, cement floor
    and cinder-block walls, accessible only by rickety wood plank stairs. The basement runs
    the length of the building, filled with machinery and racks upon racks of uncut
    wood, organized in a system only my boss understands. Ash, oak, pine, eucalyptus,
    ramin. Finger-jointed wood, wood made of milled scraps. Narrow, wide, flat, scooped,
    beveled, painted, stained. My boss knows them all. He knows what each wood will
    do, and what it won’t. One crumbles so easily he calls it “cornflakes.” Others
    are impossibly hard. He hates maple.'

    Jack, WKRP’s Johnny Fever; he’s Oscar the Grouch with the worst smoker’s cough
    I’ve ever heard. He keeps smoking anyway, even inside the store, though none of
    his legions of customers seem to notice. He’s a rebel, an old hippie, or maybe
    a young one? A long-hair, not a suit. No framers are suits, he tells me.

    and Robert Crumb and Lichtenstein and Dali and Hieronymus Bosch and has adorned
    the store’s walls with samples of their work and lots of other dark and strange
    images, showing off our frames. My boss quotes randomly and significantly from *Dune*.
    (It’s best just to nod.) When he’s in the basement, thumping bass and psychedelic

    alt-rock soundtrack of my youth—how does this station even still exist? (And why

    directly overlooks the sidewalk and busy street, nothing but glass between us
    and the pedestrians rushing by or stopping to look in. Lots of people know us.

    special treatment. It’s like they want to be part of us in some way.

    yells in pain.

    so beautiful, that I feel I’ve never really *seen* frames before. They are just
    squares and rectangles, pieces of wood holding air, empty space. Once fitted onto
    the artwork, they become necessary, almost invisible, essential as a body part.
