    boy in a sailor suit, smiling out from under his bangs, taken the year before
    he died, a faded note handwritten on the back: *The brother I never knew*. I use
    my phone to take a snapshot of these words. Later on my computer I’ll enhance
    it, print it out, then slide it into an acid-free sleeve to be taped onto the

    so beautiful, that I feel I’ve never really *seen* frames before. They are just
