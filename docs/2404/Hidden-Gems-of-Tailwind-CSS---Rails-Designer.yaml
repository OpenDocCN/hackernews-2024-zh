- en: Tailwind CSS makes designing and creating web UI’s a breeze. No wonder it’s
    my number one choice for every (Rails-based) SaaS app I’ve launched over the last
    few years. It is no surprise it is also a core tool of [Rails Designer](https://railsdesigner.com/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wanted to list some of the lesser known or obscure features, for future me,
    but most importantly for you to squeeze even more out of all that Tailwind CSS
    offers.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `peer`-modifier allows to style an element based on a **sibling state**.
    Alright, now you’re talking nonsense! Let’s look at an example?

- en: Please provide a valid email address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It works by adding `peer` to one element and then the immediate next element
    can use any `peer-*` utility. It works with every pseudo-class modifier, like
    `peer-hover`, `peer-required` and `peer-disabled`. Once you know this utility,
    you will find plenty of ways to use it **instead of JavaScript**.

  type: TYPE_PRE

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every color-utility in Tailwind CSS allows to append a `/n` opacity-modifier.
    So this works for every text-color, background-color and ring-color.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE3]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: I find I use this often to let elements blend more with backgrounds that have
    gradients to them. Or to get the color *just right*.

- en: Combining font-size and line-height
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a similar way you can combine font-size and line-height.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You likely know about the font-size utilites (`text-sm`, `text-base` and so
    on) and the line-height utilties (relative: `leading-loose` and `leading-tight`,
    fixed: `leading-4` and `leading-6`).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Note*: Relative line-height is based on its current font-size. While a fixed
    line-height, sets it irrespective of the current font-size.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can combine the fixed line-height with the font-size `text-xl/8` to set
    a font size of `1.25rem` with a line-height of `2rem`.

- en: Add space between elements
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one I use all the time as it’s a great way to add space between an element
    and an optional element. `gap-*` only adds the space between actual elements,
    it not just adds `margin-left` or `margin-right`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I learned too late that `gap-*` can also be used in flex layouts, not just in
    a grid (as the name implies). There’s also `gap-x-*` and `gap-y-*` if you want
    to add space respectively horizontal (left/right) or vertical (up/down).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    something I add a lot.
  prefs: []

    duration-300 hover:bg-sky-200`.'

    transition is not triggered when the user hovers over the element when scrolling.

    container-element with NotificationComponent, you have witnessed this as well.

    break your UI.

    number and adds ellipsis (`…`, not to be confused with: `...`).'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before, when you wanted a square element, like an [AvatarComponent](https://railsdesigner.com/components/avatars/),
    you needed to add both the `w-*` and the `h-*`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now these can be combined with the `size-*` utility that set the width and height
    at the same value.

    modifier. Add it your body-element to tweak every page when text is selected.

    one I use in all my Rails apps (which all use `turbo-frame`s).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Imagine the element when viewed as a page doesn’t has a dropshadow, but when
    viewed in turbo-frame (eg. as [Modal](https://railsdesigner.com/components/modals/))
    it does add a dropshadow. Making elements truly reusable.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If all of the many Tailwind CSS utilities are not enough, you can use *any value*
    you want! I use this really as a last resort, as it stills feels like going against
    the framework (even though it is a framework-supported feature).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You take any of the available utility and add your own value, like this `text-[0.65rem]`
    (really something I use in all my apps—maybe need to make it a custom variant?).
