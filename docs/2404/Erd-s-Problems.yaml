- en: Problems have always been an essential part of my mathematical life. A well-chosen
    problem can isolate an essential difficulty in a particular area, serving as a
    benchmark against which progress in this area can be measured. It might be like
    a 'marshmallow', serving as a tasty tidbit supplying a few moments of fleeting
    enjoyment. Or it might be like an 'acorn', requiring deep and subtle new insights
    from which a mighty oak can develop. […]

    classify as my favorites. Of course, I can't guarantee that they are all 'acorns',
    but because many have thwarted the efforts of the best mathematicians for many
    decades (and have often acquired a cash reward for their solutions), it may indicate
    that new ideas will be needed, which can, in turn, lead to more general results,
    and naturally, to further new problems.
