# The end of non-compete agreements is a tech job earthquake – Computerworld

The FTC argues that while requiring workers in low-end jobs to sign non-competes is an overstretch, valuable employees shouldn’t be restricted either. After all, the agency claims, “Trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) both provide employers with well-established means to protect proprietary and other sensitive information. Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a non-compete already have an NDA.”

In addition, as FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said: “Non-compete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once non-competes are banned.”

I don’t know if the end of non-competes would do all that. But I do know that in the decades I’ve been writing about technology, I’ve seen non-competes become iron collars around the necks of tech’s best and brightest workers, help desk staffers and even the people who keep the offices clean.
