    Oregon Lottery on Monday that he and his 37-year-old wife, Duanpen, are taking
    half the money, and the rest is going to a friend, Laiza Chao, 55, of the Portland
    suburb of Milwaukie. Chao had chipped in $100 to buy a batch of tickets with them.
    They are taking a lump sum payment, $422 million after taxes.

    to the U.S. in 1994\. He wore a sash at the news conference identifying himself
    as Iu Mien, a southeast Asian ethnic group with roots in southern China. Many
    Iu Mein were subsistence farmers and assisted American forces during the Vietnam
    war; after the conflict, thousands of Iu Mien families fled to Thailand to avoid
    retribution and eventually settled in the U.S.

    something for my family first.”
