    in the world to make assisted suicide legal in 2001\. Since then, it’s become
    an increasingly popular option. In 2022, there were 8,720 euthanasia deaths in
    the Netherlands — representing roughly 5% of all the country’s deaths and up from
    4% from the year before. In February, the 93-year-old former Dutch Prime Minister
    Dries van Agt and his wife were euthanized.
