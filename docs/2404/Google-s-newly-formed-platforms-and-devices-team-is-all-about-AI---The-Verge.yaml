    and the company is changing in big ways to try to make it happen even faster.
    Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced substantial internal reorganizations on Thursday,
    including the creation of a new team called “Platforms and Devices” that will
    oversee all of Google’s Pixel products, all of Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Photos,
    and more. The team will be run by Rick Osterloh, who was previously the SVP of
    devices and services, overseeing all of Google’s hardware efforts. Hiroshi Lockheimer,
    the longtime head of Android, Chrome, and ChromeOS, will be taking on other projects
    inside of Google and Alphabet.

    only one reason for all of it, Osterloh says: AI. “This is not a secret, right?”
    he says. Consolidating teams “helps us to be able to do full-stack innovation
    when that’s necessary,” Osterloh says. He uses the example of the Pixel camera:
    “You had to have deep knowledge of the hardware systems, from the sensors to the
    ISPs, to all layers of the software stack. And, at the time, all the early HDR
    and ML models that were doing camera processing… and I think that hardware / software
    / AI integration really showed how AI could totally transform a user experience.
    That was important. And it’s even more true today.”'

    Tensor products to keep up with Nvidia and others, and keeping hardware and software
    close together and aware of each other’s work makes it easier to improve quickly.
    This is the sort of thing you can try to do with two teams, he says, but when
    it’s a single team with a single leader and a single goal, everything can just
    be faster.'

    to me on Google Meet. The two men have been friends and colleagues for decades
    and swear up and down that this change is not the result of some internal power
    struggle. (Even when I bring it up as a joke, they both loudly and quickly shoot
    me down.) They’ve been talking with Pichai about making this shift for more than
    two years, Lockheimer says, and now finally felt like the right time.

    AI across all of its products. “We have a really quick way to get the latest research,
    the latest models, from DeepMind,” he says, noting also that Jay Yagnik, a longtime
    researcher and engineer in Google’s AI team, is now coming over to Osterloh’s
    team, in part to facilitate that interaction. One way to look at these changes
    is to simplify the pipeline: there’s now a team that does AI research and a team
    that does AI products. “A lot of times,” Osterloh continues, “that will mean figuring
    out how we build a new application based on the output of our latest model, and
    being able to move people around quickly to do that.” Google, which in many ways
    was caught flat-footed by the AI revolution, knows it needs to do everything possible
    to move as fast as possible.'

    AI团队的资深研究员兼工程师Jay Yagnik现在也加入了Osterloh的团队，部分原因是促进这种互动。看待这些变化的一种方式是简化管道：现在有一个进行AI研究的团队和一个进行AI产品开发的团队。“很多时候，”Osterloh继续说道，“这意味着我们需要根据最新模型的输出来构建新应用程序，并能够迅速调动人员来完成这些任务。”谷歌在许多方面都被AI革命所措手不及，知道需要尽一切可能尽快行动起来。

    firewall between Pixel and Android, though. “We have always kept distinct teams
    between Android and our ecosystem partners, and our first-party hardware efforts,”
    he says. Sameer Samat, who has until now helped run Android under Lockheimer,
    will now be the president of the Android ecosystem. Samat has all those ecosystem
    relationships, Lockheimer says, and that will all be fine. And Cristiano Amon,
    the CEO of Qualcomm and one of the first people briefed on this change, said in
    a statement that “I look forward to working with Rick to deliver leading Android
    experiences powered by Snapdragon not only in mobile but across Auto, XR and Compute.”

    Amon在这一变化的首位知情人中之一，发表声明表示：“我期待与Rick合作，通过Snapdragon提供领先的Android体验，不仅限于移动设备，还包括Auto、XR和Compute。”
- en: At the same time, it’s clear that Google is pressing harder into its role as
    the tip of the spear for Android — especially as AI takes over the operating system.
    Google is already adding its Gemini model and chatbot everywhere it can think
    of, has been adding AI features to the Pixel’s camera for the last two years,
    and clearly has big plans for how AI can change the way you use your phone — and

    else.

    Auto、Wear OS、ChromeOS和其他设备的方式。
- en: Changes like this seem to be part of an ongoing cycle at Google, a company that
    famously allows for a sprawling, largely autonomous working environment — which
    is how you get Gmail but also a thousand messaging apps and under-integrated products
    — and then occasionally makes an effort to consolidate around bigger initiatives
    and improving profits. “More wood behind fewer arrows,” co-founder Larry Page
    [called it in 2011](https://www.techradar.com/news/internet/page-more-wood-behind-fewer-arrows-driving-google-success-979307),

    Plus。谷歌肯定希望其在人工智能全力推进方面取得更好的结果。

- en: Going forward, Osterloh says his priorities haven’t changed, though his day-to-day
    meeting cadence certainly will. In general, he says, the plan is just to make
    everything *faster.* To update Google’s devices more often as AI models improve.
    To nimbly launch new products, rather than mire everything in process and bureaucracy.

    a technology Pichai himself has said could be as important as fire. Every app
    Google owns and every platform it administers is going to be changed by Gemini.
    For that to work, Google itself — the company, its structure, its very culture
    — is going to change. It’s not always going to be easy, but there’s clearly no
