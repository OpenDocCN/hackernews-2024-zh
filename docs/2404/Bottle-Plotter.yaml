    they don't use bottle labels. Usually they just draw some basic info on the bottle
    with special (**Edding**) paint marker. That is how I got this idea. Everybody
    can get paper label printed, but what about bottle plotter. CNC that would used
    paint marker as plotter to plot the label directly on the bottle. And with tool-changer
    you could also have more colors.

    do this mental kick-off and start to work on it. Usually, what works for me is
    that when the mood is right I go outside walking and fully put myself in this
    trans-like state where I keep iterating on that idea and create first design in
    my head. But the "mood" was not coming for some time, so once I have found myself
    forced to drive for 2h alone in car back home. I never tried this while driving,
    but I have managed to get myself into that state and come with first design. I
    also decided I would like to prototype it as fast as possible.

    print it again. It was kind of amazing, funny but also exhausting. On beginning
    I started simply on the whole mechanical configuration of the plotter. Main ideas
    for before I started.

    top did not work, it was trying to push the bottle but not roll it every time.
    I decided to abandon multi-tool quite soon as it started to be obvious it is just
    big complication for now and sign of feature creep. And should be pushed to the
    future as "**Nice to have**".

    and printing about 4 revision of some part per day. But I was learning a lot.
    I used some parts that I already had on hand as linear stage etc. so this defined
    some aspects of the design.

    CNC shield and GRBL, it is not great but it is cheap and should be enough. I spent
    quite some time with debugging interference issues between limit switches and
    motors. Which I think is price for this cheap electronics.

    testing motorized roller on bottom. But this also did not work well. One of the
    issue was that, as the bottle is not perfect you may end up on different spot
    when you are rotating back and forward. Also one the issues is that you need some
    freedom of movement on the pen to allow for following surface of bottle. So everything
    points to having the pen vertical. In hindsight it seems sooooo obvious.

    so I went with linear rail that I had at hand. I wanted to use just gravity for
    pushing the pen but ended up with spring after all.

    disadvantage is that the motor has lower resolution as there are not any gears
    or lead screw to make its step finer. But that should not be an issue.

    not have really that many experience to be sure how I want to really design it.
    But for V2 I decided to build 3D assembly before printing and building.

    on circular surface and funny enough, you don't need to do anything. All the machine
    acts as the bottle is flat surface and it rotates around its axis. So any SW that
    can generate data for 2D plotter should work.

    Convert it to **G-Code** that is than played from PC over **USB** to **GRBL**
    motor driver. I had issues with finding something that I would be happy with so
    after all I decided to slicer/CAM on my own. It is simple web pages where you
    upload svg and the get g-code file after some processing. Stack is pure JS with
    some JQ. There is still need for improvements, but it works and it is kind of
    fun to work on it.

    solution. Which is annoying as it took me quite some time to get to that. But
    it is also sign that it is probably the right one. I was also able to get the
    component price for everything for around **150$** without printed parts, which
    I'm quite happy about.
