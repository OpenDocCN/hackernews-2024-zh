- en: I have noticed that, it is quite common in group of small wine producers, that
    they don't use bottle labels. Usually they just draw some basic info on the bottle
    with special (**Edding**) paint marker. That is how I got this idea. Everybody
    can get paper label printed, but what about bottle plotter. CNC that would used
    paint marker as plotter to plot the label directly on the bottle. And with tool-changer
    you could also have more colors.

    do this mental kick-off and start to work on it. Usually, what works for me is
    that when the mood is right I go outside walking and fully put myself in this
    trans-like state where I keep iterating on that idea and create first design in
    my head. But the "mood" was not coming for some time, so once I have found myself
    forced to drive for 2h alone in car back home. I never tried this while driving,
    but I have managed to get myself into that state and come with first design. I
    also decided I would like to prototype it as fast as possible.

    print it again. It was kind of amazing, funny but also exhausting. On beginning
    I started simply on the whole mechanical configuration of the plotter. Main ideas
    for before I started.

    top did not work, it was trying to push the bottle but not roll it every time.
    I decided to abandon multi-tool quite soon as it started to be obvious it is just
    big complication for now and sign of feature creep. And should be pushed to the
    future as "**Nice to have**".

- en: First prototype was just awful, ugly falling apart. I was usually designing
    and printing about 4 revision of some part per day. But I was learning a lot.
    I used some parts that I already had on hand as linear stage etc. so this defined
    some aspects of the design.

    CNC shield and GRBL, it is not great but it is cheap and should be enough. I spent
    quite some time with debugging interference issues between limit switches and
    motors. Which I think is price for this cheap electronics.

- en: On the picture, there is already little bit advanced version on which I started
    testing motorized roller on bottom. But this also did not work well. One of the
    issue was that, as the bottle is not perfect you may end up on different spot
    when you are rotating back and forward. Also one the issues is that you need some
    freedom of movement on the pen to allow for following surface of bottle. So everything
    points to having the pen vertical. In hindsight it seems sooooo obvious.

    disadvantage is that the motor has lower resolution as there are not any gears

    on circular surface and funny enough, you don't need to do anything. All the machine
    acts as the bottle is flat surface and it rotates around its axis. So any SW that

    after all I decided to slicer/CAM on my own. It is simple web pages where you
    upload svg and the get g-code file after some processing. Stack is pure JS with
