    calendar Q1, amid a wider downturn in orders and plunging profits.

- en: The photolithography giant reported a 40 percent dive in net profit to €1.2
    billion ($1.3 billion) for the three months ended March 31, off the back of a
    25 percent drop in revenue to €3.966 billion ($4.22 billion)

- en: Revenue was about the midpoint of ASML’s earlier guidance, however, new order
    bookings worth €3.6 billion ($3.8 billion) fell short of analyst expectations,
    and were considerably down from the record $9.1 billion ($9.6 billion) in Q4 of
    last year, attributed by some to Chinese chipmakers [hurrying to get orders in](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/china_stockpiling_asml_kit/)
    before new export restrictions landed.

    the US administration, effectively banned ASML from selling some of its deep ultraviolet
    (DUV) lithography machines to China from January.

    Roger Dassen said in a video interview. "I think it''s important to recognize
    that the order intake over the past six months, if you take the Q4 and the Q1
    order intake together, you''re looking at nearly €13 billion [$13.83 billion],
    which is a pretty significant number," he claimed.'

    is typically quite lumpy."

    (EUV) photolithography equipment for making the most advanced semiconductors,
    ASML should be able to ride out any troughs in order bookings. A new wave of chip
    fabrication plants are being constructed around the world, notably in the US thanks
    to funding from the Biden administration’'s [CHIPS Act](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/15/biden_intel_chips_funds/).

    gearing up towards what we think is going to be a strong year of 2025\. That is
    really backed up by some of the industry trends as we see them today. That means
    for us building a capacity and preparing for that ramp," he said.'

    aperture) EUV equipment, which provides better resolution for smaller features
    with the most advanced production processes. Intel was the [first customer](https://www.reuters.com/technology/asml-ships-first-high-na-lithography-system-intel-statement-2023-12-21/)
    to receive a TWINSCAN EXE:5200 system at its facility in Hillsboro, Oregon, earlier
    this year.

- en: '"The industry is really excited around High NA and for very good reasons,"
    Dassen claimed. "If you look at the specifications of the High NA tool, it will
    provide a transistor density that actually is 3x of the transistor density that
    you will have with a low NA tool. So it''s a really big step up," he said.'

    €5.7 billion ($6.06 billion) and €6.2 billion ($6.59 billion). Outgoing President
    and CEO Peter Wennink - who leaves this month - said the outlook for the full
    year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half expected to be stronger than the
    first, in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn.

    are likely as the US tries to curb China’s semiconductor advances and leans on
    its allies to fall in line.

    optimistic, and still expects to reach annual revenue in 2025 of between €30 billion
    ($31.9 billion) and €40 billion ($42.3 billion).

    "If you just look at all the fab openings that have been indicated by our customers.
    The recent news on positive outcomes of CHIPS Act money allocation. All of that
    is very strong, very supportive for new fab openings across the globe." ®'
