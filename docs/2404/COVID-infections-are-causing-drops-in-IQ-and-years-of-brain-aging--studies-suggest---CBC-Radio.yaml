- en: When COVID-19 first reared its head back in 2019, it brought with it a slew
    of strange symptoms beyond just respiratory problems. One of the most puzzling
    symptoms in those early days was something called "brain fog" — cognitive issues
    like confusion, forgetfulness, and trouble focusing.

- en: And while other symptoms have changed as the virus mutated, brain fog is still
    a common complaint of COVID sufferers not only during the initial illness, but extending
    for months or even years afterwards. Several recent studies have been trying to
    understand exactly what this virus is doing to our brains — and how to stop it.

    that people experience after SARS-CoV-2 infection is what we call colloquially
    as brain fog. That's the mental haziness, the inability to remember things, to
    connect the dots, to really think clearly.

    coming back to the clinics with mini strokes. We see a lot of people with headache
    disorders, sleep disturbances, sleep problems. A lot of people come back to the
    clinic with tingling of the extremities, tingling in the legs or sometimes in
    the arms. In rare cases, seizure disorders. So really a variety of health problems
    in the brain.

    comparing people who had COVID-19, versus people who didn't, and then gave them
    cognitive testing to measure their ability to cognitively process information
    and test their IQ. And there's very clear differences in the IQ of people who
    had been infected with COVID-19 versus people who did not. Even mild COVID can
    give people about a three-point loss of IQ.

    phase of the pandemic when we didn't have vaccination, when the virus was very
    different and we didn't have antivirals. And we also don't really know whether
    those cognitive losses that I just described, that three-point IQ loss, we don't
    really know how permanent that is.

    brain with neuroplasticity and other other sort of mechanisms will be able to
    restore itself back to normal health. But I think that really remains to be characterized
    and seen in studies.

    One of the clear signals from the studies that we've done and a lot of other people
    have done over the past several years is that clearly in some people it can provoke
    inflammatory reactions in the brain or neuroinflammation and that may explain
    some of the symptoms that are experienced by some individuals.

- en: It can affect multiple substances on which the brain really depends to function
    normally. One of them is cortisol. So [people have studied this out of Yale University](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06651-y#:~:)
    and have shown that people with long COVID or people after SARS-CoV-2 infection
    can experience inappropriately low level of cortisol and that's actually an important
    hormone for a lot of certain normal physiologic processes, including cognitive
    performance, and a lower cortisol level than where it should be can explain some
    of the cognitive dysfunction that is seen in some people after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
    There are some studies also done on [showing low serotonin levels](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2811556) and
    that can also explain some of the symptoms.

- en: By inducing that inflammation of the brain, that actually [makes that barrier
    leaky](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9), so it starts leaking
    things into the brain that shouldn't be there. And things from the brain to outside
    the brain that also should not exit outside the brain. So a leaky blood brain
    barrier can also explain, you know, some of the manifestations that we see after
    COVID-19 infection.

    still see people in the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we still see people
    with strokes and heart attacks and, you know, brain fog and all other manifestations.
    But overall, I think the risk has sort of declined over the course of the pandemic.

    that SARS-CoV-2 infection can produce this really large basket of long-term adverse
    health effects. When we went back and started thinking about what happened to
    people after the Spanish flu, we found historical accounts that sort of resemble,

    increased risk of Parkinson's disease, headaches, brain fog etcetera.

    are long tails to pandemics. And yes, we can focus all we want on the acute phase,

    chunk of disability and disease beneath that tip of the iceberg.
