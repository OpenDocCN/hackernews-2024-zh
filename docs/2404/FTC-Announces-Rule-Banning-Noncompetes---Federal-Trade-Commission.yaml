- en: Today, the Federal Trade Commission [issued a final rule](/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/noncompete-rule.pdf)
    to promote competition by banning noncompetes nationwide, protecting the fundamental
    freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new business
    formation.

    economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would
    be created a year once noncompetes are banned,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The
    FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to
    pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”

- en: The FTC estimates that the final rule banning noncompetes will lead to new business
    formation growing by 2.7% per year, resulting in more than 8,500 additional new
    businesses created each year. The final rule is expected to result in higher earnings
    for workers, with estimated earnings increasing for the average worker by an additional
    $524 per year, and it is expected to lower health care costs by up to $194 billion
    over the next decade. In addition, the final rule is expected to help drive innovation,
    leading to an estimated average increase of 17,000 to 29,000 more patents each
    year for the next 10 years under the final rule.

- en: Noncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual
    conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business.
    Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they want to leave or
    bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced to switch to a lower-paying
    field, being forced to relocate, being forced to leave the workforce altogether,
    or being forced to defend against expensive litigation. An estimated 30 million
    workers—nearly one in five Americans—are subject to a noncompete.

    will no longer be enforceable after the rule’s effective date. Existing noncompetes
    for senior executives - who represent less than 0.75% of workers - can remain
    in force under the FTC’s final rule, but employers are banned from entering into
    or attempting to enforce any new noncompetes, even if they involve senior executives. Employers
    will be required to provide notice to workers other than senior executives who
    are bound by an existing noncompete that they will not be enforcing any noncompetes
    against them.

    which was subject to a 90-day public comment period. The FTC received more than
    26,000 comments on the proposed rule, with over 25,000 comments in support of
    the FTC’s proposed ban on noncompetes. The comments informed the FTC’s final rulemaking
    process, with the FTC carefully reviewing each comment and making changes to the
    proposed rule in response to the public’s feedback.

- en: In the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair method
    of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for employers
    to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce certain noncompetes.

- en: The Commission found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive
    conditions in labor markets by inhibiting efficient matching between workers and
    employers. The Commission also found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect
    competitive conditions in product and service markets, inhibiting new business
    formation and innovation. There is also evidence that noncompetes lead to increased
    market concentration and higher prices for consumers.

    that still enable firms to protect their investments without having to enforce
    a noncompete.

    with well-established means to protect proprietary and other sensitive information.
    Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a noncompete already have an
    NDA.

    employers that wish to retain employees can compete on the merits for the worker’s
    labor services by improving wages and working conditions.

    in force. Employers, however, are prohibited from entering into or enforcing new
    noncompetes with senior executives. The final rule defines senior executives as
    workers earning more than $151,164 annually and who are in policy-making positions.

    that would have required employers to legally modify existing noncompetes by formally
    rescinding them. That change will help to streamline compliance.

    to workers bound to an existing noncompete that the noncompete agreement will
    not be enforced against them in the future. To aid employers’ compliance with
    this requirement, the Commission has included [model language](/legal-library/browse/rules/noncompete-rule)
    in the final rule that employers can use to communicate to workers.
