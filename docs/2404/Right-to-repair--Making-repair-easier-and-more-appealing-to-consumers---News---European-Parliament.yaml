- en: On Tuesday, Parliament adopted the directive on the so-called “right to repair”
    for consumers with 584 votes in favour, 3 against and 14 abstentions. The rules
    clarify the obligations for manufacturers to repair goods and encourage consumers
    to extend a product’s lifecycle through repair.

- en: The new rules ensure that manufacturers provide timely and cost-effective repair
    services and inform consumers about their rights to repair. Goods repaired under
    the warranty will benefit from an additional one-year extension of the legal guarantee,
    further incentivising consumers to choose repair instead of replacement.

- en: After the legal guarantee has expired, the manufacturer is still required to
    repair common household products, which are technically repairable under EU law,
    such as washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and even smartphones. The list of product
    categories can be extended over time. Consumers may also borrow a device whilst
    theirs is being repaired or, if it cannot be fixed, opt for a refurbished unit
    as an alternative.

- en: A European information form can be offered to consumers to help them assess
    and compare repair services (detailing the nature of the defect, price and duration
    of the repair). To make the repair process easier, a European online platform
    with national sections will be set up to help consumers easily find local repair
    shops, sellers of refurbished goods, buyers of defective items or community-led
    repair initiatives, such as repair cafes.

- en: The rules aim to strengthen the EU repair market and reduce repair costs for
    consumers. Manufacturers will have to provide spare parts and tools at a reasonable
    price and will be prohibited from using contractual clauses, hardware or software
    techniques that obstruct repairs. In particular, they cannot impede the use of
    second-hand or 3D-printed spare parts by independent repairers, nor can they refuse
    to repair a product solely for economic reasons or because it was previously repaired
    by someone else.

    least one measure to promote repair, such as repair vouchers and funds, conducting
    information campaigns, offering repair courses or supporting for community-led
    repair spaces.

    (S&D, DE) said: “Consumers’ right to repair products will now become a reality.
    It will be easier and cheaper to repair instead of purchase new, expensive items.
    This is a significant achievement for Parliament and its commitment to empower
    consumers in the fight against climate change. The new legislation extends legal
    guarantees by 12 months when opting for repair, gives better access to spare parts
    and ensures easier, cheaper and faster repair.”'

- en: According to the [European Commission](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023SC0059),
    the premature disposal of consumer goods produces 261 million tons of CO2-equivalent
    emissions, consumes 30 million tonnes of resources, and generates 35 million tonnes
    of waste in the EU each year. Consumers also lose about €12 billion yearly by
    replacing goods rather than repairing them. Additionally, the new rules are expected
    to bring €4.8 billion in growth and investment within the EU. The directive complements
    other new EU rules on [Ecodesign](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231204IPR15634/deal-on-new-eu-rules-to-make-sustainable-products-the-norm)

    measures to promote a right to repair and access to spare parts; taking EU action
    to incentivise consumers to use products for longer; and addressing planned obsolescence
    and ensuring the right to repair.
