- en: 'Born in Vienna, Tom (née Martha) Seidmann-Freud (1892–1930) was the daughter
    of Maria Freud, Sigmund’s sister. Around the age of fifteen, she assumed the name
    Tom — preferring its masculine tone — and moved abroad to study art in London
    and Berlin, finally settling in Munich. Here, she befriended the scholar Gershom
    Scholem, who would [remember](https://archive.org/details/fromberlintojeru00scho/page/124/mode/2up)
    her as: “an authentic bohemian”, who “lived on cigarettes, so to speak”. Expelled
    from Bavaria in 1920 due to her father’s Romanian citizenship, she returned to
    Berlin, where she created children’s books and founded the Peregrin publishing
    house — [named](https://www.documenta14.de/en/artists/22765/tom-seidmann-freud)
    after the Latin *peregrinus*, a Roman term for foreigner — with Jankew Seidmann,
    her soon-to-be husband. In one of only a handful of private letters that have
    survived, we can [hear](https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/files/95878/95878.pdf)
    the excitement of this period in Tom’s own words: “Jakele is good and clever and
    I love him very much. In spring, all our sins will be forgiven. Which I really
    need!” It was through Peregrin that the *Buch Der Hasengeschichten* was released,
    along with 1923’s [*Die Fischreise*](https://leopard.tu-braunschweig.de/receive/dbbs_mods_00000177)
    (The Fish’s Journey), the story of a young boy who finds a golden realm beneath
    the waves, published shortly after her teenage brother drowned in the Mäckersee.
    She worked for a time with the poet Hayim Nahman Bialik to illustrate fairy tales
    in Hebrew — intended to stock Zionist schools in Palestine — and later turned
    to pedagogical texts. The quality of these primers and copybooks made Walter Benjamin
    poignantly [suggest](https://www.textlog.de/benjamin/kritik/chichleuchlauchra-fibel),
    during a glowing review in the *Frankfurter Zeitung*, that “where children play,
    a secret lies buried”.'
