- en: United Airlines was pushed into the red by Boeing and its ongoing quality issues,
    the airline said Tuesday. The company took a $200 million hit in the first quarter

    an [Alaska Airlines](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/business/alaska-air-boeing-max-flight/index.html)

  zh: 波音及其持续存在的质量问题使联合航空陷入赤字，该航空公司周二表示。在阿拉斯加航空的一次[飞行](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/business/alaska-air-boeing-max-flight/index.html)中，波音737
    Max 9因门插件事故而被停飞，导致该公司在第一季度损失2亿美元。

- en: The blow out of a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight caused a three-week
    grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration of the 737 Max 9 model of jets,
    and brought fresh questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. United,
    which depends on Boeing planes for about 80% of its mainline fleet, had 86 of
    the Max 9 jets, more than any other airline in the world and it was hit particularly
    hard by Boeing’s problems.

    as United was able to increase capacity from a year earlier despite the 737 Max
    9 grounding. The measures of fares, such as the average amount paid by passengers
    for each available seat, adjusted for miles flown, were up about 1%.
