- en: The FTC argues that while requiring workers in low-end jobs to sign non-competes
    is an overstretch, valuable employees shouldn’t be restricted either. After all,
    the agency claims, “Trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) both
    provide employers with well-established means to protect proprietary and other
    sensitive information. Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a non-compete
    already have an NDA.”

    low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from
    the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once non-competes
    are banned.”'

    in the decades I’ve been writing about technology, I’ve seen non-competes become
    iron collars around the necks of tech’s best and brightest workers, help desk
    staffers and even the people who keep the offices clean.
