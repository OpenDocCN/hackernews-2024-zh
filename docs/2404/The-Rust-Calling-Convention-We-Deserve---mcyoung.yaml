    unimaginative one when it comes to passing complicated types effectively. A lot
    of people ask me “ok, what would you use instead”, and I just point them to the
    [Go register ABI](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.regabi/src/cmd/compile/internal-abi.md),

    one value to pass. The amount of data we need to return is *not* the size of the
    struct. For example, `[(u64, u32); 2]` measures 32 bytes wide. However, eight
    of those bytes are padding! We do not need to preserve padding when returning
    by value, so we can flatten the struct into `(u64, u32, u64, u32)` and sort by
    size into `(u64, u64, u32, u32)`. This has no padding and is 24 bytes wide, which
    fits into the three return registers LLVM gives us on x86\. We define the *effective
    size* of a type to be the number of non-`undef` bits it occupies. For `[(u64,
    u32); 2]`, this is 192 bits, since it excludes the padding. For `bool`, this is
    one. For `char` this is technically 21, but it’s simpler to treat `char` as an
    alias for `u32`.

- en: This also isn’t even getting into what returns *could* look like. `Result`s
    are often passed through several layers of functions via `?`, which can result
    in a lot of redundant register moves. Often, a `Result` is large enough that it
    doesn’t fit in registers, so each call in the `?` stack has to inspect an ok bit
    by loading it from memory. Instead, a `Result` return might be implemented as
    an out-parameter pointer for the error, with the ok variant’s payload, and the
    is ok bit, returned as an `Option<T>`. There are some fussy details with `Into`
    calls via `?`, but the idea is implementable.

- en: Now, because we’re Rust, we’ve also got a trick up our sleeve that C doesn’t
    (but Go does)! When we’re generating the ABI that all callers will see (for `-Zcallconv=fast`),
    we can look at the function body. This means that a crate can advertise the *precise*
    ABI (in terms of register-passing) of its functions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这为基于极端优化的 ABI 打开了大门。我们可以从简单地丢弃未使用的参数开始：如果函数对参数没有任何操作，就不要浪费寄存器。
- en: 'Another example: suppose that we know that an `&T` argument is not retained
    (a question the borrow checker can answer at this point in the compiler) and is
    never converted to a raw pointer (or written to memory a raw pointer is taken
    of, etc). We also know that `T` is fairly small, and `T: Freeze`. Then, we can
    replace the reference with the pointee directly, passed by value.'

  zh: '另一个例子：假设我们知道 `&T` 参数不会被保留（这个问题借用检查器在编译器的这一点可以回答），且永远不会转换为原始指针（或者写入一个取原始指针的内存等）。我们还知道
    `T` 相当小，并且 `T: Freeze`。那么，我们可以用值传递直接替换引用的指针。'
- en: The most obvious candidates for this is APIs like `HashMap::get()`. If the key
    is something like an `i32`, we need to spill that integer to the stack and pass
    a pointer to it! This results in unnecessary, avoidable memory traffic.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最明显的候选者是像 `HashMap::get()` 这样的 API。如果键是像 `i32` 这样的东西，我们需要将该整数溢出到堆栈并传递指针！这导致了不必要的、可以避免的内存流量。
- en: Profile-guided ABI is a step further. We might know that some arguments are
    hotter than others, which might cause them to be prioritized in the register allocation
    order.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 基于配置文件的 ABI 是更进一步的步骤。我们可能会知道某些参数比其他参数更热门，这可能会导致它们在寄存器分配顺序中优先考虑。
- en: 'You could even imagine a case where a function takes a very large struct by
    reference, but three `i64` fields are very hot, so the caller can *preload* those
    fields, passing them both by register *and* via the pointer to the large struct.
    The callee does not see additional cost: it had to issue those loads anyway. However,
    the caller probably has those values in registers already, which avoids some memory
    traffic.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 甚至可以想象一种情况，一个函数通过引用接收一个非常大的结构体，但是三个 `i64` 字段非常热门，所以调用者可以通过寄存器和大结构体的指针同时传递这些字段。调用者不会看到额外的成本：它必须发出这些加载指令。然而，调用者可能已经在寄存器中保存了这些值，这样可以避免一些内存流量。
- en: Instrumentation profiles may even indicate that it makes sense to duplicate
    whole functions, which are identical except for their ABIs. Maybe they take different
    arguments by register to avoid costly spills.

  zh: 仪表化配置甚至可能表明，复制整个函数是有意义的，这些函数除了 ABI 外完全相同。也许它们通过寄存器接收不同的参数，以避免昂贵的溢出。
- en: This is a bit more advanced (and ranty) than my usual writing, but this is an
    aspect of Rust that I find really frustrating. We could be doing *so much better*
    than C++ ever can (because of their ABI constraints). None of this is new ideas;
    this is *literally* how Go does it!

  zh: 这比我通常的写作要更加高级（和抱怨），但这是我发现 Rust 中令人沮丧的一个方面。我们可以比 C++ 做得更好（因为它们的 ABI 约束）。这些不是新的想法；这
    *确实* 是 Go 是如何做到的！
- en: So why don’t we? Part of the reason is that ABI codegen is complex, and as I
    described above, LLVM gives us very few useful knobs. It’s not a friendly part
    of rustc, and doing things wrong can have nasty consequences for usability. The
    other part is a lack of expertise. As of writing, only a handful of people contributing
    to rustc have the necessary grasp of LLVM’s semantics (and mood swings) to emit
    the Right Code such that we get good codegen and don’t crash LLVM.

  zh: 那么我们为什么不这样做呢？部分原因是 ABI 代码生成很复杂，正如我上面描述的那样，LLVM 给我们提供了很少有用的控制选项。这对于 rustc 并不友好，做错事情可能会对可用性产生不好的后果。另一部分原因是缺乏专业知识。截至目前，只有少数几个人在为
    rustc 做贡献时具备了足够理解 LLVM 语义（和情绪波动）的能力，以便发出正确的代码，使我们获得良好的代码生成且不会崩溃 LLVM。
- en: Another reason is compilation time. The more complicated the function signatures,
    the more prologue/epilogue code we have to generate that LLVM has to chew on.
    But `-Zcallconv` is intended to only be used with optimizations turned on, so
    I don’t think this is a meaningful complaint. Nor do I think the project’s Goodhartization
    of compilation time as a metric is healthy… but I do not think this is ultimately
    a relevant drawback.

  zh: 另一个原因是编译时间。函数签名越复杂，我们需要生成的序言/尾声代码就越多，LLVM 需要处理的就越多。但是 `-Zcallconv` 旨在仅在打开优化时使用，所以我认为这不是一个有意义的抱怨。我也不认为将项目的编译时间视为度量标准是健康的……但我认为这最终不是一个相关的缺点。
- en: I, unfortunately, do not have the spare time to dive into fixing rustc’s ABI
    code, but I do know LLVM really well, and I know that this is a place where Rust
    has a low bus factor. For that reason, I am happy to provide the Rust compiler
    team expert knowledge on getting LLVM to do the right thing in service of making
    optimized code faster.
