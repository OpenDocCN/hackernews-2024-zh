- en: LAWRENCE — With the evolution of artificial intelligence comes discussion of
    the technology's environmental impact. A new study has found that for the tasks
    of writing and illustrating, AI emits hundreds of times less carbon than humans
    performing the same tasks. That does not mean, however, that AI can or should
    replace human writers and illustrators, the study’s authors argue.

  zh: 劳伦斯 — 随着人工智能的发展，有关这项技术对环境的影响的讨论也在进行中。一项新研究发现，在写作和插图任务中，AI排放的碳远少于人类执行相同任务的量。然而，研究的作者们认为，这并不意味着AI能够或应该取代人类作者和插图师。

- en: Like cryptocurrency, AI has been subject to debate about the amount of energy
    it uses and its contributions to climate change. Human emissions and environmental
    impact have long been studied, but comparisons between the two have been scant.
    The authors conducted a comparison and found that AI systems emit between 130
    and 1,500 times less CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per page of text generated
    than human writers and illustration systems between 310 and 2,900 times less CO2e
    per image than humans.

  zh: 像加密货币一样，人工智能（AI）一直受到关于其能源消耗及对气候变化贡献的辩论。长期以来，人类排放和环境影响一直受到研究，但对两者之间的比较研究很少。研究人员进行了比较，并发现AI系统每生成一页文字所排放的二氧化碳当量（CO2e）比人类作者和插图系统少130到1500倍，而插图则比人类少310到2900倍。

    We’ve had discussions about something that appears to be true in terms of AI emissions,
    but we wanted to look at the data and see if it truly is more efficient,” Torrance
    said. “When we did it, the results were kind of astonishing. Even by conservative
    estimates, AI is extremely less wasteful.”

- en: To calculate the carbon footprint of a person writing, the researchers consulted
    the Energy Budget, a measure that considers the amount of energy used in certain
    tasks for a set period of time. For example, it is well established how much energy
    a computer with word processing software uses per hour. When multiplied by the
    average time it takes a person to write a page of text, on average, 250 words,
    an estimate can be arrived at. Using the same amount of energy used by the CPUs
    that operate AI such as ChatGPT, which can produce text much faster, produces
    an estimate for AI.

  zh: 为了计算人类写作的碳足迹，研究人员参考了能源预算，这是一种考虑特定任务在一定时间内使用的能量量度。例如，已经明确了处理文字处理软件的计算机每小时使用的能量量。通过乘以人写一页文本所需的平均时间，平均250个字，可以得出一个估计。使用像ChatGPT这样的AI的CPU使用相同的能量量，其速度更快，可以为AI生成文本进行估算。
- en: Researchers also considered per capita emissions of individuals in the United
    States and India. Residents of the former have approximate annual emissions of
    15 metric tons CO2e per year, while the latter is an average of 1.9 metric tons.
    The two nations were chosen as they have the highest and lowest respective per
    capita environmental impact of countries with population higher than 300 million,
    and to provide a look at different levels of emissions in different parts of the
    world in comparison to AI.

- en: The authors wrote that carbon emissions are only one factor to consider when
    comparing AI production to human output. As the technologies exist now, they are
    often not capable of producing the quality of writing or art that a human can.
    As they improve, they hold the potential to both eliminate existing jobs and create
    new ones. Loss of employment has potential for substantial economic, societal
    and other forms of destabilization. For those and other reasons, the authors wrote,
    the best path forward is likely a collaboration between AI and human efforts,
    or a system in which people can use AI to be more efficient in their work and
    retain control of final products.

  zh: 作者写道，在比较AI生产与人类产出时，碳排放只是一个要考虑的因素之一。就目前的技术而言，它们通常无法产生人类所能做到的写作或艺术质量。随着它们的改进，它们有可能既能消灭现有的工作岗位，又能创造新的岗位。失业可能会对经济、社会和其他形式的不稳定产生重大影响。出于这些原因及其他原因，作者写道，最好的前进道路可能是AI与人类努力的合作，或者是一个人们可以利用AI在工作中更高效，并保留对最终产品控制的系统。
