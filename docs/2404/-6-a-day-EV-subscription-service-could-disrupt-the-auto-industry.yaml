- en: We love a BIG idea, and they don't come much bigger than this. Helixx Technologies
    has begun taking registrations in Southeast Asia for its electric car and van
    subscription service and we're about to see a fascinating roll-out of what appears
    to be a thoroughly excellent and potentially VERY disruptive idea.

- en: Helixx's cheapest subscription rate works out to $0.25 cents per hour, which
    would logically be the full-time rate of having a new car/van with "the lot" (insurance,
    maintenance) ... that's $6.00 per day ... no up front fees ... nothing else to
    pay ... just add your own electricity.

    which is an attribute bound to appeal to those using the EV for commercial purposes
    - with the ownership model, that's the owner's problem. Here, the car is immediately
    replaced like-for-like and commercial activity resumes post haste.

    swappable makes sense too. The Helixx vehicle platform can take up to six 2 kWh
    LFP (Lithium iron Phosphate (LFP) battery packs for a total capacity of 12 kWh
    and a range of 200 km (124 miles). If that's not enough for a taxi shift or a
    delivery run, it's just a matter of swapping batteries to be productive again.
    Charging times become irrelevant.

    The 140cm long load bay is accessible by a rear door 110cm wide, so it can accommodate
    most global shipping pallets. The body is 3.2 meters long and 1.5 meters wide.

    car "ownership model" that is responsible for the 1.5 billion cars currently circulating
    on the planet. The problem is that the ownership model has the momentum of a century-old
    industry behind it and a lot of influential people have a lot invested in maintaining
    the status quo.

- en: In Western economies, where there are dozens of cars in each class competing
    in a replacement market, it is important that manufacturers have cars that compete
    on the spec sheet, so they build their cars bigger and stronger to be safely capable
    of the 100+ mph speeds their competitors can do, and the end result is that we
    are all paying to have a car that is engineered for conditions it will never experience.
    It is much heavier than it needs to be, so it needlessly uses lots of energy accelerating
    and decelerating, and tires and brake pads wear faster because of the weight too.

    software and communications platform can be configured to show advertising on
    large screens that can be fitted to the sides of the van, and signing up to fit
    this system to your van is quite simple. Put simply, if a vehicle is going to

    generate advertising revenue whilst they work.
