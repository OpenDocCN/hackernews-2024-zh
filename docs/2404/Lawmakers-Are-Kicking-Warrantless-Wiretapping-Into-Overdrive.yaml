    surveillance powers. The legislation has been packaged by its proponents as a
    reform bill but privacy advocates say that it would actually vastly expand the
    government’s spying capabilities.

    would renew key surveillance powers enjoyed by the U.S. intelligence community,
    broadly known as Section 702\. Section 702 was created in 2008 as part of [the
    FISA Amendments Act](https://www.eff.org/702-spying), which gave the government
    the legal authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans who communicate
    with people outside of the country. The law allows the U.S. intelligence community
    (most [notably the NSA](https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-nsa-abuses-reauthorization/))
    [to conduct “targeted surveillance”](https://www.dni.gov/files/icotr/Section702-Basics-Infographic.pdf)
    of people outside the U.S. with the “compelled assistance of electronic communication
    service providers,” when a [government court](https://www.progressivecaucuscenter.org/the-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-act-and-the-warrantless-collection-of-personal-data)
    deems it necessary for national security reasons.

    at non-Americans, the law has [repeatedly allowed large amounts of Americans’
    communications to become ensnared in the government’s net](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pclob-report-reveals-new-abuses-fisa-section-702).
    As the Brennan Center, a legal nonprofit associated with NYU, [has put it,](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/pclob-report-reveals-new-abuses-fisa-section-702)
    Section 702 has become a “go-to domestic spying” tool that is used to “conduct
    hundreds of thousands of warrantless ‘backdoor’ searches for Americans’ private
    communications every year.”

    flows of [online communications providers](https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Section-702.pdf).
    Now, however, the new update would vastly expand the government’s ability to deputize
    U.S. businesses to spy on communications. Problematically, the vague language
    within the bill makes it difficult to understand what kind of organizations would
    be called upon to spy for the government and which would be exempted.

    counsel at the ACLU, told Gizmodo. “There was a version that came out in December
    that was hugely problematic.” The new version, which was released this week, now
    exempts “certain businesses—like hotels, for instance,” he says. However, the
    very fact that these carveouts are necessary would seem to speak to the overly
    broad nature of the bill’s legal reach.

    government to compel the assistance of a wide range of additional entities and
    persons in conducting surveillance under FISA 702\. The breadth of the new definition
    is obvious from the fact that the drafters felt compelled to exclude such ordinary
    places such as senior centers, hotels, and coffee shops. But for these specific
    exceptions, the scope of the new definition would cover them—and scores of businesses
    that did not receive a specific exemption remain within its purview.

    the owners and operators of facilities that house equipment used to store or carry
    data, such as data centers and buildings owned by commercial landlords, who merely
    have access to communications equipment in their physical space. It could also
    include other persons with access to such facilities and equipment, including
    delivery personnel, cleaning contractors, and utility providers.

    of the private sector into acting as its own personal intelligence asset. Indeed,
    Hamadanchy gives some examples of companies that might potentially fall under
    this category and they are numerous: “Commercial landlords, grocery stores, barber
    shops, hardware shops, fitness centers” or, as he puts it, “anyone with a WiFi”
    connection.'

    once they were involved in said spy work. In the case of commercial landlords,
    for instance, it seems unclear what role such a business owner might play if called
    upon to surveil a target for the government. That said, it’s easy to speculate.
    “My assumption is that they would go to the” landlord “and then tap into the WiFi
    network of that building,” Hamadanchy offered.

    is a bad bill,” Hamadanchy said. “We shouldn’t do a bad bill. We should take the
    time to do it right.” Hamadanchy said that the Senate rules could allow the policy
    process to be dragged out until Sunday and that he expected that there might be
    an effort to strip the bill of its more controversial policies.

    On Wednesday, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan [released a

    claiming that the new legislation would ensure “that the U.S. government has the
    tools to protect our national security, while dramatically enhancing protections
    for privacy and civil liberties.” He subsequently called on the Senate to “quickly
    send the bill to the President’s desk.”
