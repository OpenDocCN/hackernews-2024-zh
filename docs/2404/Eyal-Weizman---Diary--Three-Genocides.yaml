    argued that Israel’s actions in Gaza have been ‘genocidal in character’, since
    ‘they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the
    Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group.’ Lawyers cited the killing of 23,000
    Palestinians (the number is now more than 33,000), the majority of them women
    and children, the destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure, including schools
    and hospitals, and the displacement of practically Gaza’s entire population. Israel
    staged its defence the following day, claiming that ‘if there were acts of genocide,
    they have been perpetrated against Israel.’ Its lawyers called on the court to
    dismiss the case and reject South Africa’s request that military operations against
    Gaza be halted.

    it would intervene as a ‘third party’, siding with Israel. Any signatory to the
    1948 Genocide Convention can put forward ‘substantive arguments’ in a dispute
    over the interpretation of the treaty. In 2023, Germany intervened in the genocide
    case brought by Gambia against Myanmar for its treatment of the Rohingya, in support
    of the view that Myanmar’s actions constituted genocide. In the South African
    case, a German government spokesman declared that ‘in light of Germany’s history
    and the crime of humanity – the Shoah – the federal government sees itself as
    particularly committed to the Genocide Convention.’ In other words, it had expertise
    in such questions, and the current accusations against Israel had ‘no basis whatsoever’:
    they were merely an attempt to politicise the convention. The memory of the Holocaust
    is considered to be the moral foundation of postwar Germany, and the defence of
    Israel’s security, as Angela Merkel affirmed in 2008, is Germany’s Staatsräson.

    can be compared to the Holocaust – is therefore heresy.'

    a victim of colonialism and apartheid [South Africa] to protect another genocide
    [Israel’s].’ Two weeks later, on 26 January, by fifteen judges to two, the ICJ

    was echoed by a curious historical coincidence. The date of the second day of
    the hearing and of Germany’s intervention – 12 January – was the 120th anniversary
    of the events that put into motion the first genocide of the 20th century, which
    was perpetrated by Germany’s colonial army, the Schutztruppe. The targets were
    the Ovaherero (often referred to in European sources as Herero) and Nama peoples
    in a territory Germany had claimed and colonised as South-West Africa – what is
    now called Namibia. The region had been ceded to Germany by the other European
    powers at the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, which formalised the partition of
    Africa. Bismarck’s Second Reich sought the colonial empire it believed its power
    on the world stage merited, and the territories covering what are now Togo, Cameroon,
    Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Namibia were established as German ‘protectorates’.

- en: On 12 January 1904, fighting broke out in the town of Okahandja between German
    troops and Ovaherero fighters led by Samuel Maharero. More than a hundred soldiers
    and settlers, mostly farmers and missionaries, were killed in the following days
    and the Schutztruppe was forced to retreat. Humiliated, Germany started to plan
    retribution. The Ovaherero were cattle herders whose lands were located in the
    region’s central plateau. These fertile hills were late to be colonised and had
    escaped the worst of the Atlantic slave trade because the sand dunes that stretch
    for hundreds of miles along the coast hid them from the view of European seafarers
    on their way to the Cape. In the Nama/Damara language, *namib* means ‘shield’.
    But once the German protectorate was established, the region became an ideal candidate
    for what in 1897 the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel termed Lebensraum – the
    space that was needed to sustain a species or people in their Darwinian struggle
    for survival. To allow German settlement, Indigenous peoples had to be moved out
    of the way. At first the land was taken piecemeal by enforced protection contracts
    and sales agreements, threats, bribes and massacres, but gradually German Africa
    came into existence as a matrix of farms, missionary outposts, mineral and diamond
    mines, and military forts like the one in Okahandja. Ratzel believed that South-West
    Africa was a place where the ‘German race’ could harden its character. He took
    his inspiration from Frederick Jackson Turner, who argued that American political
    and cultural identity had largely been formed, half a century earlier, by the
    experiences of the rugged Western frontier. The African frontier was similarly
    inhabited by people seen as subhuman, part of the natural environment, who could
    be exploited, expelled or exterminated at will.

    took refuge around the homesteads of the Kambazembi clan, at the foot of the mountain

    poisoned by German troops. A great many others succumbed to thirst and starvation

    – known in German as Hornkranz. It was the seat of Hendrik Witbooi, chief of the
    Witbooi Nama people. The territory between the Nama and the Ovaherero to the north
    was disputed, and skirmishes were not uncommon, but Witbooi turned down all German
    offers of protection, insisting that local peoples should be allowed to deal with
    their own problems. When in 1886 he was approached by German emissaries sent by
    the colonial administrator, Heinrich Göring, he refused to negotiate with anyone
    but the emperor himself. ‘I understand that you want to negotiate peace, you who
    call yourself a “deputy”,’ he responded. ‘How shall I respond? You are someone
    else’s representative, and I am a free and autonomous man answering to none but
    God.’ Witbooi kept a diary that gives an important African perspective on the

    own relatives – and scrape off the flesh with glass so that the skulls could be

    through representatives chosen by themselves.’ The OTA and NTLA position is encapsulated
    in a slogan: ‘Anything about us, without us, is against us.’ Germany’s acknowledgment
    of genocide amounted to less than the affected communities had hoped for. Germany
    understood its admission to be morally rather than legally binding; the events
    of 1904 to 1908 could be described as genocide, but only if considered from today’s
    perspective. It was relying on a legal formality, long challenged in cases of
    genocide and slavery: the ‘intertemporal principle’ holds that a legal question
    must be assessed on the basis of the laws in effect at the time the act was committed.
    Germany argued that since the UN Convention on Genocide only came into force in
    1948 it couldn’t be applied to the genocide in South-West Africa. A similar argument
    was presented by Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem: since Hitler’s orders possessed
    ‘the force of law’ in the Third Reich, Eichmann was acting according to the laws
    of the time. The mass killing of civilians in the context of war was already illegal
    under the terms of The Hague Convention of 1899 when both genocides were perpetrated;
    but since international law referred to wars between ‘civilised peoples’ this
    was taken to exclude colonial violence against Indigenous populations. Germany
    argued that crimes committed in South-West Africa should be assessed not in line
    with modern legal standards but in accordance with the racist laws of the colonial
    era. This prompted Sima Luipert of the NTLA to retort that Germany was effectively
    saying that the Nama and Ovaherero were exterminated as ‘uncivilised savages’.'

    ‘Development is the greatest Northern lie, the presumed generosity of a civilisation

    some of their ancestral lands from the descendants of German settlers and return

    may still be controversial in German academic and political circles, as well as
    in the media, but it is certainly not new. In *The Origins of Totalitarianism*
    (1951), Hannah Arendt argued that ‘European imperialism played a crucial role
    in the development of Nazi totalitarianism and associated genocides.’ The ‘boomerang
    effect’, as defined by Aimé Césaire, identified European fascism as the homecoming
    of colonial violence. In 1947, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that ‘there was no Nazi atrocity
    – concentration camps, wholesale maiming and murder, defilement of women, or ghastly
    blasphemy of childhood – which the Christian civilisation of Europe had not long
    been practising against coloured folks in all parts of the world.’ These connections
    have been discussed more recently by David Olusoga and Casper W. Erichsen in *The
    Kaiser’s Holocaust* (2010), and by Juergen Zimmerer in *From Windhoek to Auschwitz?*
    (2019). The links between the genocide in South-West Africa and the Holocaust
    depend on something else that Zimmerer makes clear: the colonial dimension of
    the Nazi exterminatory war in Eastern Europe. As Timothy Snyder put it, colonial
    ambitions transformed the ‘black earth’ of the Ukrainian steppe into ‘bloodlands’
    of ethnic conquest, enslavement and genocide. After imperial Germany lost its
    colonial empire in the First World War, the Nazis planned to attain Lebensraum
    by colonising the fertile, food-producing regions in Ukraine, where the majority
    of Eastern European Jews lived. Germany’s colonial policies may have been factors
    in the near total destruction of Jews and the enslavement of Slavic peoples in
    Eastern Europe, but the imperial-colonial dimension can’t explain every aspect
    of the Holocaust, which has ideological roots in a European antisemitism that
