    argued that Israel’s actions in Gaza have been ‘genocidal in character’, since
    ‘they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the
    Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group.’ Lawyers cited the killing of 23,000
    Palestinians (the number is now more than 33,000), the majority of them women
    and children, the destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure, including schools
    and hospitals, and the displacement of practically Gaza’s entire population. Israel
    staged its defence the following day, claiming that ‘if there were acts of genocide,
    they have been perpetrated against Israel.’ Its lawyers called on the court to
    dismiss the case and reject South Africa’s request that military operations against
    Gaza be halted.

    it would intervene as a ‘third party’, siding with Israel. Any signatory to the
    1948 Genocide Convention can put forward ‘substantive arguments’ in a dispute
    over the interpretation of the treaty. In 2023, Germany intervened in the genocide
    case brought by Gambia against Myanmar for its treatment of the Rohingya, in support
    of the view that Myanmar’s actions constituted genocide. In the South African
    case, a German government spokesman declared that ‘in light of Germany’s history
    and the crime of humanity – the Shoah – the federal government sees itself as
    particularly committed to the Genocide Convention.’ In other words, it had expertise
    in such questions, and the current accusations against Israel had ‘no basis whatsoever’:
    they were merely an attempt to politicise the convention. The memory of the Holocaust
    is considered to be the moral foundation of postwar Germany, and the defence of
    Israel’s security, as Angela Merkel affirmed in 2008, is Germany’s Staatsräson.
    The idea that Israel can be accused of perpetrating a genocide – or that any genocide
    can be compared to the Holocaust – is therefore heresy.'

    2023年，德国在冈比亚针对缅甸对罗兴亚人的待遇的种族灭绝案中干预，支持缅甸的行为构成种族灭绝的观点。 在南非案件中，一位德国政府发言人宣称‘鉴于德国的历史和人类罪行——大屠杀——联邦政府认为自己对种族灭绝公约特别承诺。’
    换句话说，它在这类问题上有专业知识，并且对以色列当前的指控‘完全没有任何根据’：它们仅仅是政治化公约的尝试。 大屠杀的记忆被认为是战后德国道德基础，而保卫以色列的安全，正如安格拉·默克尔在2008年确认的那样，是德国的国家理念。
    因此，以色列被指控实施种族灭绝，或者任何种族灭绝可以与大屠杀相提并论的观念，因此是异端邪说。

    Hage Geingob (who died on 4 February), rebuked Germany, arguing that it ‘cannot

    government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil.’
    Tlaleng Mofokeng, the South African UN special rapporteur on the right to health,
    summed up the situation: ‘The state that committed more than one genocide throughout
    its history [Germany] is trying to undermine the efforts of a country that is
    a victim of colonialism and apartheid [South Africa] to protect another genocide
    [Israel’s].’ Two weeks later, on 26 January, by fifteen judges to two, the ICJ

    of the events that put into motion the first genocide of the 20th century, which
    was perpetrated by Germany’s colonial army, the Schutztruppe. The targets were
    the Ovaherero (often referred to in European sources as Herero) and Nama peoples
    in a territory Germany had claimed and colonised as South-West Africa – what is
    now called Namibia. The region had been ceded to Germany by the other European
    powers at the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, which formalised the partition of
    Africa. Bismarck’s Second Reich sought the colonial empire it believed its power
    on the world stage merited, and the territories covering what are now Togo, Cameroon,
    Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and Namibia were established as German ‘protectorates’.

- en: On 12 January 1904, fighting broke out in the town of Okahandja between German
    troops and Ovaherero fighters led by Samuel Maharero. More than a hundred soldiers
    and settlers, mostly farmers and missionaries, were killed in the following days
    and the Schutztruppe was forced to retreat. Humiliated, Germany started to plan
    retribution. The Ovaherero were cattle herders whose lands were located in the
    region’s central plateau. These fertile hills were late to be colonised and had
    escaped the worst of the Atlantic slave trade because the sand dunes that stretch
    for hundreds of miles along the coast hid them from the view of European seafarers
    on their way to the Cape. In the Nama/Damara language, *namib* means ‘shield’.
    But once the German protectorate was established, the region became an ideal candidate
    for what in 1897 the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel termed Lebensraum – the
    space that was needed to sustain a species or people in their Darwinian struggle
    for survival. To allow German settlement, Indigenous peoples had to be moved out
    of the way. At first the land was taken piecemeal by enforced protection contracts
    and sales agreements, threats, bribes and massacres, but gradually German Africa
    came into existence as a matrix of farms, missionary outposts, mineral and diamond
    mines, and military forts like the one in Okahandja. Ratzel believed that South-West
    Africa was a place where the ‘German race’ could harden its character. He took
    his inspiration from Frederick Jackson Turner, who argued that American political
    and cultural identity had largely been formed, half a century earlier, by the
    experiences of the rugged Western frontier. The African frontier was similarly
    inhabited by people seen as subhuman, part of the natural environment, who could
    be exploited, expelled or exterminated at will.

    through representatives chosen by themselves.’ The OTA and NTLA position is encapsulated
    in a slogan: ‘Anything about us, without us, is against us.’ Germany’s acknowledgment
    of genocide amounted to less than the affected communities had hoped for. Germany
    understood its admission to be morally rather than legally binding; the events
    of 1904 to 1908 could be described as genocide, but only if considered from today’s
    perspective. It was relying on a legal formality, long challenged in cases of
    genocide and slavery: the ‘intertemporal principle’ holds that a legal question
    must be assessed on the basis of the laws in effect at the time the act was committed.
    Germany argued that since the UN Convention on Genocide only came into force in
    1948 it couldn’t be applied to the genocide in South-West Africa. A similar argument
    was presented by Eichmann at his trial in Jerusalem: since Hitler’s orders possessed
    ‘the force of law’ in the Third Reich, Eichmann was acting according to the laws
    of the time. The mass killing of civilians in the context of war was already illegal
    under the terms of The Hague Convention of 1899 when both genocides were perpetrated;
    but since international law referred to wars between ‘civilised peoples’ this
    was taken to exclude colonial violence against Indigenous populations. Germany
    argued that crimes committed in South-West Africa should be assessed not in line
    with modern legal standards but in accordance with the racist laws of the colonial
    era. This prompted Sima Luipert of the NTLA to retort that Germany was effectively
    saying that the Nama and Ovaherero were exterminated as ‘uncivilised savages’.'

  zh: 去年，多位联合国特别报告员致函两国政府，明确指出根据2007年由德国和纳米比亚签署的《联合国原住民权利宣言》，‘原住民有权通过由自己选择的代表参与决定其权利受影响的事务。’
    OTA 和 NTLA 的立场以一句口号概括：‘没有我们参与的事情，就是反对我们。’ 德国对种族灭绝的承认并未达到受影响社区所希望的程度。德国认为其承认在道德上而非法律上具有约束力；1904年至1908年的事件可以被描述为种族灭绝，但只能从今天的角度来看。
    德国依赖一种长期在种族灭绝和奴隶制案件中受到质疑的法律形式，即‘跨时期原则’认为法律问题必须根据行为时期的法律评估。 德国辩称，由于联合国种族灭绝公约仅于1948年生效，因此不适用于西南非洲的种族灭绝。埃希曼在耶路撒冷审判中也提出了类似的论点：由于希特勒的命令在第三帝国具有‘法律力量’，埃希曼是按照当时的法律行事的。
    在两次种族灭绝事件发生时，根据1899年海牙公约的条款，战争背景下的大规模屠杀平民已经是非法的；但由于国际法是指‘文明国家’之间的战争，这被认为排除了对原住民族群的殖民暴力。
    德国主张，在评估在西南非洲犯下的罪行时，不应按照现代法律标准，而应根据殖民时代的种族主义法律。 这促使NTLA的Sima Luipert反驳，称德国实际上在说纳马族和奥瓦赫雷罗族被灭绝是因为‘未开化的野蛮人’。

    also meant it denied it had any obligation to pay reparations or facilitate restitution.
    Accepting legal responsibility would have set a precedent that could be used by
    other colonial peoples that had experienced genocide at the hands of European
    states including France and Britain. Germany announced that it would pay €1.1
    billion over thirty years in development aid. Before colonisation, the Ovaherero
    and Nama had been rich in land, cattle and culture. Luipert puts it like this:
    ‘Development is the greatest Northern lie, the presumed generosity of a civilisation
    founded on our oppression.’ The affected communities insisted that Germany purchase
    some of their ancestral lands from the descendants of German settlers and return
    them. Almost three years after its publication, as a result of objections from
    Namibian civil society groups and opposition parties, the joint declaration has
    not been ratified by either the German or the Namibian parliament.'

    和 Nama 拥有丰富的土地、牛群和文化。Luipert 将其描述为：“发展是最大的北方谎言，是一个建立在我们压迫之上的文明的假定慷慨。” 受影响的社区坚持德国从德国移民后裔手中购买一些他们祖先的土地并归还给他们。由于纳米比亚的民间社会团体和反对党的反对意见，联合声明在其发布近三年后，德国和纳米比亚的议会均未批准该声明。

- en: 'The claim that there is a relationship between colonialism and National Socialism
    may still be controversial in German academic and political circles, as well as
    in the media, but it is certainly not new. In *The Origins of Totalitarianism*
    (1951), Hannah Arendt argued that ‘European imperialism played a crucial role
    in the development of Nazi totalitarianism and associated genocides.’ The ‘boomerang
    effect’, as defined by Aimé Césaire, identified European fascism as the homecoming
    of colonial violence. In 1947, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that ‘there was no Nazi atrocity
    – concentration camps, wholesale maiming and murder, defilement of women, or ghastly
    blasphemy of childhood – which the Christian civilisation of Europe had not long
    been practising against coloured folks in all parts of the world.’ These connections
    have been discussed more recently by David Olusoga and Casper W. Erichsen in *The
    Kaiser’s Holocaust* (2010), and by Juergen Zimmerer in *From Windhoek to Auschwitz?*
    (2019). The links between the genocide in South-West Africa and the Holocaust
    depend on something else that Zimmerer makes clear: the colonial dimension of
    the Nazi exterminatory war in Eastern Europe. As Timothy Snyder put it, colonial
    ambitions transformed the ‘black earth’ of the Ukrainian steppe into ‘bloodlands’
    of ethnic conquest, enslavement and genocide. After imperial Germany lost its
    colonial empire in the First World War, the Nazis planned to attain Lebensraum
    by colonising the fertile, food-producing regions in Ukraine, where the majority
    of Eastern European Jews lived. Germany’s colonial policies may have been factors
    in the near total destruction of Jews and the enslavement of Slavic peoples in
    Eastern Europe, but the imperial-colonial dimension can’t explain every aspect
    of the Holocaust, which has ideological roots in a European antisemitism that
    long predates colonialism.'

  zh: 在德国学术和政治圈以及媒体中，声称殖民主义与国家社会主义之间存在关系可能仍然具有争议，但这并不新鲜。在《极权主义的起源》（1951年）中，汉娜·阿伦特认为，“欧洲帝国主义在纳粹极权主义和相关种族灭绝的发展中起了至关重要的作用。”艾梅·塞萨尔定义的“回旋镖效应”将欧洲法西斯主义视为殖民暴力的回归。1947年，W·E·B·杜波伊斯写道，“欧洲的基督教文明长期以来一直在全世界对有色人种实施集中营、大规模伤害和谋杀、亵渎妇女或对童年进行可怕的亵渎，这些都是纳粹暴行的前车之鉴。”大卫·奥卢索加和卡斯珀·W·埃里克森在《凯撒的大屠杀》（2010年）以及尤尔根·齐梅尔在《从温得和克到奥斯维辛？》（2019年）中最近讨论了这些联系。在东欧的纳粹灭绝战争中，帝国主义德国的殖民维度是这些关联的基础，正如蒂莫西·斯奈德所说，殖民野心将乌克兰草原上的“黑土地”变成了种族征服、奴役和种族灭绝的“血土地”。在第一次世界大战后，帝国主义德国失去了其殖民帝国，纳粹计划通过殖民化乌克兰的肥沃食品生产地区来获得“生存空间”，那里是东欧犹太人的大多数居住地。德国的殖民政策可能已经成为近乎彻底毁灭犹太人和奴役斯拉夫民族的因素，但帝国-殖民维度不能解释大屠杀的每个方面，后者在意识形态上根源于早于殖民主义的欧洲反犹太主义。

    But a lack of government funding and structural neglect has allowed sites important

    buried in face of mainly white residents who use it as a field on which to test
    all-terrain vehicles. Other historical sites are unknown and unmarked. Namibia’s
    economy depends on European tourism, and commemorating a European genocide makes
    visitors uncomfortable. In the tourist camp at the Waterberg National Park, a
    restaurant serving German dishes – ‘game Schnitzel’ was on the menu when I went
    – occupies a colonial-era police station. A photograph of the Kaiser looms over
    the diners. The wine is sent up from a cellar that was used as a prison during
    the genocide. The only cemetery in the area – well-tended and much visited – contains
    the remains of the German soldiers killed when attacking the Ovaherero in Waterberg.
    Few visitors to this breathtaking landscape realise that the cemetery stands on
    the ruins of the Kambazembi homesteads destroyed in August 1904\. This fact, known
    to oral historians, was confirmed by a single old photograph of the village that
