    revealed is that publishing has a lot of problems. This is very true! At the same
    time, many of the problems seem to have mutated into unbelievable chimeras as
    they made their way around the discourse. Today, for example, much of the literary
    internet was debating a claim that 50% of books published sell fewer than 12 books.

- en: This claim took off with the usual suspects—conservative pundits claiming publishing
    is too “woke” and self-publishing evangelicals saying every author would make
    a fortune if they ditched traditional publishing—but the publishing professionals
    I know said this claimis very fishy. (I’m pretty sure publishers would go out
    of business if 50% of their books sold less than 12 copies!) So this statistic
    isn’t true. Or at least it isn’t true in the way you might think.

    claim joins a couple others that have gone around the internet recently: “[98

    “[90 percent sell fewer than 2,000 copies](https://twitter.com/alex_shephard/status/1560627121587888128)”

    of “most published books sell [X] copies” is that it—[apologies for the Derrida
    voice]—it all depends on what you mean by “book,” “published,” and “sell.” No,
    I’m not playing postmodern games here. It really is confusing.

    hundred paper pages. But the term encompasses much more than that, including books
    that have almost no text at all (for example the “[adult coloring book](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/fashion/adult-coloring-books-relaxation.html)”
    craze of the 2010s). Publishers publish novels and memoirs as well as cookbooks,
    puzzle books, Mad Libs, etc. But it’s even more confusing than this when it comes
    to those statistics.

    I wrote one novel, so published one book. Right? Not exactly. From a sales tracking
    perspective, books are published in multiple formats, each with different [ISBNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN).
    I wrote one novel, but from a title count POV I actually published 4 books: hardcover,
    paperback, ebook, and audiobook. Other books have even more formats (mass market
    version, movie tie-in editions, etc.) and because they all have different ISBNs,
    they all have different sales figures.'

    or a novel published for the first time in 2022—or it can refer to anything a
    publisher puts out in a given year, including a reissue of an existing book. But
    sometimes “published” means *any* book that exists in *any* format available for
    purchase. A hundred-year-old novel that no longer can be found bookstore shelves
    yet sits in cardboard box in the back of a warehouse somewhere is “a published
    book.” Some books are never published in print at all and exist only as ebooks
    and/or audiobooks. And many books exist in “print on demand” form in which a physical
    copy doesn’t exist until someone purchases it. In the old days, books would go
    out of print when people stopped buying them. But in the modern digital age books
    can exist “in print” for forever.

    run as a hobby in someone’s garage to multi-billion dollar companies. If you’re

    BookScan numbers. Think of BookScan as the book industry version of Nielsen TV
    ratings. Briefly, BookScan is a “point of sale” tracking system that counts the
    number of print copies sold at participating retail locations. BookScan allegedly
    tracks about 75% of retail sales including lots of indie bookstores as well as
    Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and Walmart.

    I already mentioned the issue with multiple formats above. BookScan also only
    tracks print so doesn’t include audiobooks or ebooks. (There is a Nielsen ebook
    estimator, but it’s rarely included in these statistics. And ebook sales are tricky
    since prices fluctuate wildly.) Even restricting ourselves to print books, BookScan
    misses plenty. Sales to libraries, for example, can be a significant portion of
    a book’s sales. Many small press and self-published authors might sell directly
    via an author’s website or in-person events. And so on.

    in the first 12 months after publication, and 3) sales in any random calendar
    year. Most books sell most of their copies in the first year or two after publication.
    Some books are perennial sellers and others might break out later—e.g., when there
    is a TV or film adaptation—but most sell the bulk of their copies early. Any statistic
    based on 3) is going to give you a completely inaccurate impression of what a
    book has sold. Imagine a 1998 novel that sold 6,000 its first year and 10,000
    copies to date. It might sell only 12 copies in 2022, decades later, but that
    hardly means it was a failure.

    completely meaningless unless we know what’s being included. Are you counting
    lifetime sales or one year’s sales? One year’s sales for frontlist titles or backlist
    titles? Only Big 5 books or anything with an ISBN?

- en: Take the statistic that most published books only sell 99 copies. This seems
    shocking on its face. But if you dig into it, you’ll notice it was counting one
    year’s sales of *all* books that were in BookScan’s system. That’s quite different
    statistic than saying most books don’t sell 100 copies in total! A book could
    easily be a bestseller in, say, 1960 and sell only a trickle of copies today.
    In the same way, most old movies and albums aren’t frequently watched/listened
    to in 2022\. It’s only a small percentage of past works that remain popular. Most
    backlist books selling fewer than 99 copies doesn’t tell you anything about how
    much newly released books sell.

    that don’t sell, remember that a book being in print doesn’t mean a publisher
    is actively spending lots of money on the title. It doesn’t break the bank to
    keep one box in the corner of a warehouse. And as I noted above a book can be
    “in print” these days and exist only in a digital form or awaiting “print on demand.”)

    what it’s referring to. Fifty-eight thousand books is more books than PRH publishes
    in a given year, but far less than their entire backlist. Is 58k all new books
    published with an ISBN, including self-published books? Is it something else?
    I really don’t know and none of the publishing professionals I follow seem to
    know either. (**Editing to add:** Jane Friedman, [who posted this number originally
    on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch8Q01nLsH_/?hl=en), noted there was
    no source given in testimony. Friedman gives her own guess in the comments.)

    novels that you see on bookstore shelves or reviewed in newspapers sell several
    hundred to a few thousand copies across formats. Many sell much more of course.
    I’ve seen some flops that sold only a couple hundred. And of course not all traditionally
    published novels appear in bookstores or reviewed in newspapers. Is it possible
    someone has published a Big 5 novel that sold only 12 copies over its lifetime?
    I suppose. But I don’t think it’s 5% much less 50%!

    sell relatively few copies and a handful sell millions. The statistics about the
    vast majority of traditionally published books selling fewer than five thousand
    are likely true. It’s the bestsellers that keep the industry afloat, financially.
    And it’s true that publishers often have no idea what will sell. It’s a throw-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks
    industry. Are there are lot of problems with it? A lot of things that could be
    fixed? Ways that publishers could better market the backlist or frontlist? Yes!
    But it’s not quite as dire as some of these statistics suggest.
