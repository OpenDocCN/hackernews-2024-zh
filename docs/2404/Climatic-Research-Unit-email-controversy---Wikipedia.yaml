    malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit." It found that the
    CRU's work had been "carried out with integrity" and had used "fair and satisfactory"
    methods. The CRU was found to be "objective and dispassionate in their view of
    the data and their results, and there was no hint of tailoring results to a particular
    agenda." Instead, "their sole aim was to establish as robust a record of temperatures
    in recent centuries as possible."^([[64]](#cite_note-SAP-Report-64))

    inappropriate use of statistical methods, some of the methods used may not have
    been the best for the purpose, though it said that "it is not clear, however,
    that better methods would have produced significantly different results." It suggested

    generated by their work, commenting that "as with many small research groups their
    internal procedures were rather informal." The media and other scientific organisations
    were criticised for having "sometimes neglected" to reflect the uncertainties,
    doubts and assumptions of the work done by the CRU. The UK Government's policy
    of charging for access to scientific data was described as "inconsistent with
    policies of open access to data promoted elsewhere." The panel was also stated
    that "Although we deplore the tone of much of the criticism that has been directed
    at CRU, we believe that this questioning of the methods and data used in dendroclimatology
    will ultimately have a beneficial effect and improve working practices." It found

    to the leaked documents on 17 November 2009\. Delingpole first used the word "Climategate"
    in the title of his 20 November article for *The Telegraph*: "Climategate: the
    final nail in the coffin of ''Anthropogenic Global Warming''?" A week later, his
    co-worker Christopher Booker gave Delingpole credit for coining the term.^([[13]](#cite_note-Delingpole1-13))
    Following the release of documents in the blogosphere, unproven allegations and
    personal attacks against scientists increased and made their way into the traditional
    media. Physicist [Mark Boslough](/wiki/Mark_Boslough "Mark Boslough") of the University
    of New Mexico noted that many of the attacks on scientists came from "bloggers,
    editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called
    them liars and vilified them as frauds". According to [Chris Mooney](/wiki/Chris_Mooney_(journalist)
    "Chris Mooney (journalist)") and Sheril Kirshenbaum in their book *[Unscientific
    America](/wiki/Unscientific_America "Unscientific America")* (2010), the accusations
    originated in right-wing media and blogs, "especially on outlets like Fox News".
    Journalist [Suzanne Goldenberg](/wiki/Suzanne_Goldenberg "Suzanne Goldenberg")
    of *The Guardian* reported that according to an analysis by [Media Matters](/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America
    "Media Matters for America"), "Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of climate
    scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia"
    and had "displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour of the fringe
    minority which doubts the existence of climate change".^([[14]](#cite_note-Fox1-14))'

    at the University of East Anglia created public confusion about the scientific
    consensus on climate change, leading several publications to comment on the propagation
    of the controversy in the media in the wake of a series of investigations that
    cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. In an editorial, *[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times

    Writing for *[Newsweek](/wiki/Newsweek "Newsweek")*, journalist [Sharon Begley](/wiki/Sharon_Begley

    noting that the public was unlikely to change their mind. Regardless of the reports
    exonerating the scientists, Begley noted that "one of the strongest, most-repeated
    findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told *X*, especially
    if *X* is shocking, if they are later told, 'No, we were wrong about *X*,' most

    warming denialists have responded by blaming the messengers. Climate researchers
    have endured abuse by bloggers, editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio
    talk show hosts who have called them liars and vilified them as frauds. The attacks
    had become increasingly vile as the past decade, the hottest in human history,

    March–April. **34** (2): 14; Goldenberg 2010: "Journalists at Fox News were under
    orders to cast doubt on any on-air mention of climate change, a leaked email obtained
    by a media monitoring group revealed today. According to the email, obtained by
    Media Matters, Fox News''s Washington bureau chief, Bill Sammon, imposed an order
    to make time for climate sceptics within 15 minutes of the airing of a story about
    a scientific report showing that 2000–2009 was on track to be the hottest decade
    on record. Media Matters said the bureau chief''s response to the report exhibited
    a pattern of bias by Fox News in its coverage of climate change. It also noted
    the timing of the directive. The email went out on 8 December last year, when
    the leaders of nearly 200 countries met in Copenhagen to try to reach a deal on
    climate change...In addition to the email, it said Fox had tried to delegitimise
    the work of climate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University
    of East Anglia. The network had displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage
    in favour of the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change,
    Media Matters said." See Goldenberg, Suzanne. (15 December 2010). "[Fox News chief

    quote: "*The fact is that we can''t account for the lack of warming at the moment
    and it is a travesty that we can''t.*" It is amazing to see this particular quote
    lambasted so often. It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our
    inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate
    variability. It is quite clear from the paper that I was not questioning the link
    between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and warming, or even suggesting
    that recent temperatures are unusual in the context of short-term natural variability.
    The paper on this is available here...</q>'

    to provide an in-depth account of the climategate affair. It is based on a limited
    number of textual sources (such as Montford 2010; Pearce 2010, blog content, commentary,
    reports from official inquiries, and a subset of released climate emails). These
    limitations in the data need to be noted. The paper raises the question of how
    to assess knowledge production in a highly politicized context. Sources were selected
    on accessibility criteria with a special emphasis on critical accounts. The aim
    of the paper is not to adjudicate who was right and who was wrong about the science,
    but to discuss norms of scientific practice in the light of two theoretical frameworks."
