- en: Philly Typewriter, the largest typewriter company in the world, is housed in
    a surprisingly small brick-and-mortar shop in the heart of south [Philadelphia](https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/philadelphia-pennsylvania).
    While humble in size, this shop is home to over 1,300 machines spanning 130 years
    of history. Visitors can drop in any time the shop is open to tour the workshop
    and type on restored typewriters without paying a dime. Typewriters are also for
    sale, and restorations are available for machines of all kinds (though the queue
    is typically 50 machines deep).

- en: The owners and mechanics (a whopping team of five) are the most knowledgeable
    folks around who welcome beginner and veteran typists alike to explore their many
    living antiques. You can even take a repair class if you’re interested in becoming
    one of the rarest tradesmen on the planet.

- en: 'When you first enter the shop, stop to read the Typewriter Manifesto proudly
    posted to the wall above some of the company’s rarest machines (which you can
    use!). It’s also worth taking note of the small but powerful message posted behind
    the registers: “THESE MACHINES WILL NEVER BE PRODUCED AGAIN.” It’s a great reminder
    to appreciate the artistry of typewriters, especially since all the machines that
    exist are all we have left of these mechanical beasts.'

- en: Tom Hanks, a renowned typewriter enthusiast with around 250 in his collection,
    has donated one of his prized models to the company. The rare 1953 East German
    Rheinmetall Gs typewriter came with the actor’s authograph, as well as [a typewritten
    letter saying](https://whyy.org/articles/tom-hanks-typewriter-donation-vintage-philly-store/#:~:text=Tom%20Hanks%20has%20about%20250,'),
    “You just may be giving this miracle of a machine a fuller, newer life of use.”
