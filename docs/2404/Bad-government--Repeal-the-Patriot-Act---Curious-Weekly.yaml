    really nice cakes, you tell the person “these cakes are good” and the person makes
    more nice cakes. If the person makes bad cakes and you tell the person “these
    cakes are good” then you are going to end up with a lot of bad cakes.

    merit, then it’s fine to say, “good government!” When the government does something,
    like, say, I don’t know, mass surveillance and targeted surveillance without a
    warrant, the government must be told “bad government!” If people like me and you
    don’t say “bad government!” to mass surveillance and targeted surveillance without
    a warrant, then me and you are going to end up with a lot more warrantless surveillance.

- en: The September 11, 2001 attacks have been something which gained a lot of attention.
    I mean, there are 50,000 Americans who died of suicide in 2023, but for some reason,
    when a few planes kill 2,996 people all at once, then we have to act completely
    different or whatever. Should we do stuff so planes don’t fly into the buildings?
    Of course. But let’s not act like more government departments and agencies are
    going to banish death. Oh, you want to, *checks notes*, prevent anyone from ever
    dying again? Good luck with that. There were 15,129 deaths from gang violence
    in America in 2017\. In numbers, ~5 9/11s happened in 2017 from people in America
    shooting each other, but that’s not what some people are paying attention to.
    The 50,000 Americans who died of suicide last year is like ~16 9/11s happening
    over 12 months, but that’s not what some people pay attention to. So next time
    you hear “never forget,” or whatever, maybe consider suicide in America was, strictly
    speaking, ~16 times more lethal in the 12 months spanning 2023 than a few planes
    hijacked by weird Muslim guys 23 years ago.

    shocked the nation. If you haven’t heard of “The Shock Doctrine” by Naomi Klein,
    I highly reccomend the book. The 9/11 attacks were the shock. Then came a wave
    of garbage. Should America fight a war in Iraq because a weird Muslim guy from
    Saudi Arabia is hiding out in, *checks notes*, the mountains of Pakistan? Bad
    government! I mean, the stuff makes literally zero sense. Once the American population
    was shocked, certain people saw the American population as malleable, as it were,
    for whatever. Then decisions were made. Those decisions are decisions which have
    had impacts which have lasted decades at this point.

    Act was the first of many changes to surveillance laws that made it easier for
    the government to spy on ordinary Americans by expanding the authority to monitor
    phone and email communications, collect bank and credit reporting records, and
    track the activity of innocent Americans on the internet. While most Americans
    think it was created to catch terrorists, the Patriot Act actually turns regular
    citizens into suspects,” [per the American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act).

    “allows internet service providers to disclose customer records voluntarily to
    the government in emergencies.” Oh, so like, all the time? There are literally
    a bunch of emergencies which have been said to exist by various presidents which
    have also not been declared over. And now this new law says, well, as long as
    there’s an “emergency” going on, then internet service providers have to fork
    over these records to whoever asks for them.

    the clear, bright line which says that unless a judge has signed a search warrant
    the federal government may not search a person and his effects, which includes
    his computer, which includes his internet activity on the computer he bought with
    the money earned at his job. Bad government!

    There are numerous emergencies said to be happening even though the country doesn’t
    have, I don’t know, North Korean troops on the Minnesota border or something or
    like a bunch of North Koreans who have invaded North Dakota. If a bunch of North
    Koreans had invaded North Dakota then I could understand the declaration of an
    emergency. There are people to fight those guys, but for some people in North
    Dakota, is a bunch of North Koreans shooting at you an emergency? I can see that
    argument being made.

    there an emergency declared with regard to Saudi Arabia after 17 of the 19 hijackers
    were found to have been Saudi Arabian nationals?) Of course Americans being held
    hostage is not cool and not good. But is the fact Americans were held hostage
    from 1979 to 1981 an “emergency” in 2024? I mean, the emergency for the hostages
    ended literally 42 years ago. All of the presidents since Jimmy Carter have not
    ended this “emergency.” Bad government! The emergency ended. Just say that.
