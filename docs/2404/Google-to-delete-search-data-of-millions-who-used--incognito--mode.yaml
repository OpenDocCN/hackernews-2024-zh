- en: Google will destroy the private browsing history of millions of people who used
    "incognito" mode in its Chrome browser as a part of [a settlement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24527110-google-unopposed-settlement)
    filed to federal court on Monday in a case over the company's secret tracking
    of web activity.

- en: For years, Google simply informed users of Chrome's internet browser that "you've
    gone Incognito" and "now you can browse privately," when the supposedly untraceable
    browsing option was turned on — without saying what bits of data the company has
    been harvesting.

- en: Yet, according to [a 2020 class-action lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24527422-amended-google-complaint),
    the tech giant continued to scrape searches by hoovering up data about users who
    browsed the internet in incognito mode through advertising tools used by websites,
    grabbing "potentially embarrassing" searches of millions of people. Google then
    used this data to measure web traffic and sell ads.

    to state that websites, employers and schools and internet service providers can
    view browsing activity in incognito mode. But under the deal, Google will have
    to state that the company itself can also track browsing during incognito mode.

    third-party companies from tracking peoples' so-called cookies, which is how advertisers
    glean information about a person's search history.

    delete old technical data that was never associated with an individual and was
