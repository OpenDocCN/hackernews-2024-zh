    operated by the Japanese company Astroscale, successfully maneuvered to within
    a few hundred meters of a discarded [rocket](https://www.space.com/29295-rocket-history.html)
    body this month, snapping a striking photo to memorialize the achievement.

    Astroscale said today (April 26) in a [post on X](https://twitter.com/astroscale_HQ/status/1783756807095324965)
    that shared the photo.'

    a big hunk of space junk — the upper stage of the Japanese [H-2A rocket](https://www.space.com/40629-japanese-rockets-hiia-hiib.html)
    that launched the GOSAT Earth-observation satellite in 2009\. Such work will help
    prove out technologies that future spacecraft can use to service satellites or
    capture and de-orbit debris objects, according to Astroscale.

    of the rocket body, which is about 36 feet long by 13 feet wide (11 by 4 meters).
    The probe then shifted into "proximity approach phase," conducting multiple maneuvers
    that reduced the distance to just a few hundred meters — a milestone that the
    newly released photo preserves for posterity.

    images of the upper stage through various controlled close-approach operations,"
    Astroscale wrote in an [update today](https://astroscale.com/astroscale-unveils-worlds-first-image-of-space-debris-captured-through-rendezvous-and-proximity-operations/).
    "The images and data collected are expected to be crucial in better understanding
    the debris and providing critical information for future removal efforts."'

- en: Removal of the biggest, most dangerous debris objects may be necessary to keep
    Earth orbit safe and accessible, many exploration advocates say. Rocket bodies
    like the H-2A upper stage are like giant bullets whizzing around Earth; if they
    slam into another hunk of junk or an active satellite, the smashup could spawn
    a debris cloud that could lead to a [catastrophic collision cascade](https://www.space.com/kessler-syndrome-space-debris).

    that we've ever seen, as [spaceflight historian Gunther Krebs noted](https://twitter.com/Skyrocket71/status/1783804494586798399).

    the spent upper stage of a Delta II rocket and [snapped an image of the object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS-10#/media/File:Delta-II_Stage2_XSS-10.jpg).
    However, this was a less complex task than the one ADRAS-J just achieved; XSS-10
    had launched aboard that same Delta II.
