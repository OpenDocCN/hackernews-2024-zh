- en: As some of you might already know, an attacker used social engineering to gain
    the maintainer role to the XZ `liblzma` compression library. A hunt is underway
    to find any other contributions that attacker made to open projects. A number
    of FOSS projects are not hosted on GitHub, but here on GitLab and are not mirrored
    over to GitHub. This attacker was a busy bee analyzing a number of other libraries
    beyond XZ.

- en: Some major distributions including Debian, Fedora, openSUSE had pipelined the
    poisoned versions of `liblzma` and a few others such as Kali Linux got as far
    as hanging it out to distribution to their general audience.

    using it between December 2023 and March 26 2024.

- en: Yes, it may feel fruitless to hunt because the attacker might have been smart
    to not use the same key/profile, but it is worth the effort just in case the attacker
    did not do that.
