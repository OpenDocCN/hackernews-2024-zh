- en: First, the Triangle represents a thoroughly distinctive set of demographic and
    economic realities—a model unlike any other. It’s younger, faster growing, less
    White, more Hispanic, slightly less educated, more economically expansive and
    diverse, more lightly taxed, more permissive in its land-use and business-regulation
    policies, and more affordable for families and businesses than its megaregion
    peers. In these respects, the Triangle conforms to a number of widely held stereotypes
    about Texas.

- en: But our analysis also shows–and our book documents in depth–that the Texas Triangle
    increasingly defies many common stereotypes. While the image of Texas as a low-tax,
    low-service, low-amenity state is partially accurate, it’s a mistake to suppose
    the Triangle owes its economic success to having a cheap, if undereducated, workforce.
    As we’ve pointed out, the Texas Triangle’s White, Black, and Asian American populations
    have higher education attainment levels than their peers in the other megaregions,
    and people earn more, on average, than their peers with comparable educational
    attainment elsewhere. And as we show in our book, the popular image of Texas as
    a deep-red bastion of ideological conservatism bears little relationship to the
    emerging urban realities of the Texas Triangle.

    sometimes do—that urban Texas is becoming more like urban centers on the coasts
    as it grows larger and more ethnically diverse. On the contrary, the Texas Triangle
    metros are growing apart in some important ways from regions like the Northeast
    Corridor and Northern California. The Triangle is becoming more economically diverse
    as the coastal regions grow more concentrated. Gaps between the Triangle and its
    coastal peers on economic policy, housing, and infrastructure are expanding, not
    shrinking. Despite the relatively young and diverse populations in the four Triangle
    metros—and their solidly blue political complexion in national elections—they
    have sustained a centrist, pragmatic style of local politics as coastal metros
    become decidedly more progressive.

    the metros in the other seven megaregions—are more similar to one another than
    they are to places anywhere else, despite their varying histories. Yes, there
    are a few differences among them: Austin has considerably higher educational attainment
    levels than the other three, San Antonio has better housing affordability, and
    Houston has a less diversified economy.'

    high population shares without health insurance and relatively weak scores for
    outdoor amenities on measures like The Trust for Public [Land’s ParkScore](https://www.tpl.org/parkscore)
    index. Most importantly, they are struggling to raise educational attainment levels
    among their homegrown populations—especially in their fast-growing Hispanic communities,
    which often face language barriers as well as inadequate investment by the state
    in urban schools serving lower- to moderate-income students. Consequently, the
    Triangle metros are overly dependent on importing the high-skilled workforce that’s
    powering the megaregion’s explosive growth from other parts of the United States.

- en: 'On the other hand, the Texas Triangle metros share a key advantage over other
    megaregions: They constitute an increasingly integrated economic system within
    a single state, which means they have better opportunities than most to forge
    a coordinated agenda for addressing their challenges. A central question for the
    future will be whether the Triangle metros and the state of Texas can work together
    on their shared priorities around education, housing, infrastructure, and economic
    development.'

- en: The Texas Triangle is emerging as a truly distinctive geographic unit, quite
    different from the state’s own historical experience and unlike other American
    megaregions. It represents a model for how to accommodate rapid population growth
    and high ethnic diversity while sustaining economic dynamism and keeping middle-class
    lifestyles more in reach than they are in most other places. The Triangle also
    bears watching as a harbinger of challenges other U.S. urban regions will face
    as they become more diverse. Still, the surging growth of the Texas Triangle ensures
    that it’s poised to play an increasingly powerful role in American society and
    in the world economy.
