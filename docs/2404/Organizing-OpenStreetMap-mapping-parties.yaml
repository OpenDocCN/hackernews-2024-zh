- en: A tape measure can be used to map a number of things, like [maxwidth:physical](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxwidth:physical)
    for barriers and [width:carriageway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:width:carriageway)
    for streets.⁵ Especially important when you realize that OSM has no concept of
    "can a bicycle/motorcycle/car/truck [physically] pass through this street?" -
    you can only say whether a vehicle is *legally* allowed or not. Which is perfectly
    sensible (since these vehicles don't have a universal standard width), but it
    means you have to survey street widths to answer that question.

- en: A tailor's tape is good for mapping small lengths like [kerb](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:barrier%3Dkerb)
    heights, [bollard](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:barrier%3Dbollard)
    gaps, widths of [pedestrian gates](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:barrier%3Dwicket_gate),
    etc. (These are all tagged with `maxwidth:physical`.)

- en: A metal tape measure (used by carpenters and plumbers) can do all that, and
    also measure somewhat larger distances such as widths of narrow streets. High-quality
    ones are stiff enough to [extend a significant distance without folding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6517aSbzlyE),
    allowing you to measure without needing someone to hold the other end.⁶ This distance
    is known as the "standout" of a tape measure.

- en: Surveyor's tape (which can be 100m or more in length) can be used for all of
    the above, and also for mapping widths of larger streets, buildings footprints,
    indoor rooms, boundaries, etc.

- en: A laser distance meter (like the [Bosch GLM 50-23G](https://www.bosch-pt.co.in/in/en/products/glm-50-23-g-0601072VK0),
    which I have) is a more expensive alternative to the above. It allows measurements
    in hard-to-reach places, e.g. measuring the `maxheight:physical` of tall height
    restrictors, gates, bridges, etc. Some have ingress protection (IP) ratings, allowing
    for use in dusty and/or wet conditions. Some of them also have angle sensors,
    useful for accurate distance measurements and for measuring inclines of roads,
    wheelchair ramps, steps, etc. (Inclines can also be measured on modern smartphones
    without any other equipment, using free software such as [Bubble](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.woheller69.level/).)
