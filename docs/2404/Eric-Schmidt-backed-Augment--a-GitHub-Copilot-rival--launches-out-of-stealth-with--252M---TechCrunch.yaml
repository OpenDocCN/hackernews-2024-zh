    AI tools as part of their development processes](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/14/hype-or-not-developers-have-something-to-say-about-ai/)
    now and 26% plan to soon. Gartner [estimates](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-04-11-gartner-says-75-percent-of-enterprise-software-engineers-will-use-ai-code-assistants-by-2028)
    that over half of organizations are currently piloting or have already deployed
    AI-driven coding assistants, and that 75% of developers will use coding assistants
    in some form by 2028.

    be a developer who *doesn’**t *use AI in their workflows. “Software engineering
    remains a difficult and all-too-often tedious and frustrating job, particularly
    at scale,” he told TechCrunch. “AI can improve software quality, team productivity
    and help restore the joy of programming.”

    would want to use.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    [emerged](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/augment-inc-raises-227-million) from
    stealth with $252 million in funding at a near-unicorn ($977 million) post-money
    valuation. With investments from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and VCs including
    Index Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Innovation
    Endeavors and Meritech Capital, Augment aims to shake up the still-nascent market
    for generative AI coding technologies.

    software is too often fragile, complex and expensive to maintain with development
    teams bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, bug fixes, security
    patches, integration requests, migrations and upgrades,” Ostrovsky said. “Augment
    has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations
    to deliver high-quality software quicker.”

    a startup developing flash data storage hardware and software products, as a founding
    engineer. While at Microsoft, Ostrovsky worked on components of Midori, a next-generation
    operating system the company never released but whose concepts have made their
    way into other Microsoft projects over the last decade.

    teamed up to create Augment’s MVP. To fill out the startup’s executive ranks,
    Ostrovsky and Gur-Ari brought on Scott Dietzen, ex-CEO of Pure Storage, and Dion
    Almaer, formerly a Google engineering director and a VP of engineering at Shopify.

    be) — save that Augment is using fine-tuned “industry-leading” open models of
    some sort.

    the company gears up for rapid growth.”

    Microsoft has GitHub Copilot, which is by far the firmest entrenched with over
    1.3 million paying individual and 50,000 enterprise customers as of February.
    Amazon has AWS’ CodeWhisperer. And Google has Gemini Code Assist, recently rebranded
    from Duet AI for Developers.

    a challenging one to maintain. Overruns related to training and serving models
