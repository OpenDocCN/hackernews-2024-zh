    dark of night during spring and fall, millions of birds fly directly over Manhattan
    on a migration path that their ancestors have been traveling for millennia. For
    some, the journey stops short here: Astonishingly, the city sees nearly 250,000
    bird deaths from collisions with glass every year.'

    makes it a risky place—that the built environment and a preponderance of glass
    create a dystopian house of mirrors for migrants drawn in and disoriented by electric
    lights. But I didn’t grasp the problem’s scale until, in 2020, I stumbled across
    a photo on social media of 26 birds that struck one building in a single morning.

    Started in 1997, the community science initiative puts boots on the ground during
    migration season to record birds injured or killed by window strikes. As with
    similar efforts around the country, trained volunteers walk prescribed routes
    at deadly hotspots citywide to collect comprehensive data about the victims they
    encounter. NYC Audubon uses the information to support advocacy, legislation,
    and research.

    away, as if someone had strewn sacks of birds across the sidewalks. I’m not easily
    rattled, but for the first 10 minutes, all I could do was murmur, “Oh my god,”
    as my trembling hands scooped up carcasses. Across four World Trade Center towers,
    over a 92-minute whirlwind, I picked up 229 dead birds (primarily warblers), photographed
    another 40 on out-of-reach awnings, and collected 29 birds with injuries. Reports
    indicate that my tally was just a fraction of the citywide toll, all victims of
    what I learned was an unfortunate confluence of conditions: stormy, low-visibility
    weather; a heavy migration pulse; and brightly lit buildings serving as lethal
    beacons in the dark.'

    to understand why birds are drawn to this urban expanse in the first place. He
    helped me picture my lower Manhattan route as it existed centuries ago: a thick
    stand of hickory and chestnut trees amid a rich mix of waterways, wetlands, and
    upland habitats. Birds stopped to rest and refuel on their migratory journeys,
    which they navigated with the help of the planet’s magnetic field, as well as
    the moon, stars, and landscape features illuminated in the otherwise pitch-dark
    night. It’s just bad luck for birds that cities tend to develop in biodiversity
    havens. “The same things that make a landmass or an area good for people are also
    usually good for birds,” Partridge says. “These long-term routes are ingrained
    over millennia...they are not just going to stop flying along the flyway because
    the city is here.”'

    Program Canada, which four years earlier became the first collision-prevention
    project in North America, and told its co-founder, Michael Mesure, that she wanted
    to get building managers to take action. “He had a good chuckle at my naivete,”

    a coalition of advocates won one of the country’s strongest ordinances, which
    requires that new and significantly renovated buildings use materials that reduce
    collision risk. “Beyond saving birds in New York City, Local Law 15 inspired similar
    requirements across the country and helped expand the market for bird-friendly
    glass, lowering prices and making it more accessible,” Wilson says. A pair of
    bills enacted in 2022 require city-owned and -managed buildings to turn off nonessential
    outdoor lights during migration and use motion sensors to minimize lights inside.
