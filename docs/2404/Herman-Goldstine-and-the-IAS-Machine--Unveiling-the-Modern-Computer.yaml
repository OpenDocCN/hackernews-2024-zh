    von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann), made in 1966 by
    the Mathematical Association of America. Grainy and noisy in its current YouTube
    incarnation, it’s nonetheless riveting, with footage of von Neumann himself and
    contributions from friends and colleagues on the Manhattan Project including Stanislaw
    Ulam, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller.

    described in his 1945 paper ‘[First Draft of a report on the EDVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC)’.
    It was this report that first set out what would become known as the [von Neumann

    of course, utterly dominates computing today.

    temerity that I approached this world-famous figure, introduced myself, and started
    talking. Fortunately for me von Neumann was a warm, friendly person who did his
    best to make people feel relaxed in his presence. The conversation soon turned
    to my work. When it became clear to von Neumann that I was concerned with the
    development of an electronic computer capable of 333 multiplications per second,
    the whole atmosphere changed from one of relaxed good humor to one more like the
    oral examination for a doctor’s degree in mathematics.

    worked on the on his automata theory at the beginning, he started since he had
    to make three dimensional objects, he brought the biggest tinker toy set that
    he could find, and he made the objects out of these until somebody we showed him
    one time how to make these two dimensionally. So he was able to give the tinker
    toys to Morgenstern's son.

    is the thing which makes the modern computer revolution possible. The older machines
    required one to clumsily perform hand pluggings of connections which took hours
    indeed days. It meant that programming was an art, in fact a very black art and
    furthermore it meant that the total number of instructions one could write were
    comparatively small. This new concept has been carried so far today that programs
    are written involving tens of millions of instructions whereas in those days of
    course nobody dreamed of such complexity. But Johnny's idea made this basically
    possible.

    in a finite number of words in fact a fairly small number of words in a fairly
    simple language exactly and unequivocally the description of a problem. And that
    this description is then translated into binary digits and stored in the memory
    of the computer exactly as numbers are stored. This was the discovery by Johnny.
