- en: When [Jonathan Goodman](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/jmg11) went looking
    for a paper published by the popular chemistry journal *Heterocycles*, he realised
    something odd. Not only was the paper he was looking for not available, all of
    the journal’s content had disappeared from the web.

- en: ‘I was looking for an article in *Heterocycles* because it’s a journal which
    contains a lot of useful articles,’ says Goodman, a chemist at the University
    of Cambridge, UK. But when he went on the journal website, Goodman came across
    a note saying publication in the journal had been suspended and there was no access
    to the title’s previously published content.

    on the *Heterocycles* webpage says the journal suspended publication in December
    2023 due to ‘various circumstances’. It goes on to add that *Heterocycles* has
    ‘completed its role in promoting the recognition of heterocyclic chemistry as
    a discipline’.

    of more than 7.4 million studies found that just under 28% were not preserved
    in any online archive, meaning that much of the scholarly literature is at risk
    of being lost if their publications are discontinued.

    and make them available, Eve notes, but that duty has transitioned to publishers
    as journals have switched to a digital format.

    material,’ Eve says. ‘However, that message has got slightly lost in that transition
    and not all publishers know that they have a responsibility to ensure the continued
    accessibility of the material they publish.’

    found that the websites of just over 2% of the more than 9000 journals indexed
    in Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) at the time were no longer active.
    While a [2021 analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11933.pdf) that evaluated the
    fate of academic journals that were delisted from indexing databases between 2000
    and 2019 found that 176 journals had vanished since being removed from prominent
    databases such as Scopus, Ulrichsweb and the DOAJ.

    scientist at the Hanken School of Economics in Helsinki, Finland, who co-authored
    the 2021 study, said at the time. ‘But as soon as a journal stops publishing they
    are commonly dropped from the indexes and since the information about removed
    journals is not maintained it is really hard to figure out which the at-risk journals
    are at any given point in time.’

    fee for access to *Heterocycles* but is concerned about continuing to do so. After
    looking into this, the library discovered that *Heterocycles* had subscribed to
    a service called [CLOCKSS](https://clockss.org/), a dark archive of around 55
    billion journal articles and 490,000 books that aims to digitally preserve scholarly
    literature. Other similar archives include [LOCKSS](https://www.lockss.org/) and
    [Portico](https://www.portico.org/).

    complete record of *Heterocycles*. According to Wise, the Japan Institute of Heterocyclic
    Chemistry is weighing up future options for the journal. ‘The content is safe
    and secure and we will be in a position to make it available should they not find
    a successor organisation to look after it,’ she notes.'
