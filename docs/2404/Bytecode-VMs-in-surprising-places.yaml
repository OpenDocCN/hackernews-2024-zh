    possible the use of general purpose workstations for network monitoring. Because
    network monitors run as user-level processes, packets must be copied across the
    kernel/user-space protection boundary. This copying can be minimized by deploying
    a kernel agent called a packet filter, which discards unwanted packets as early
    as possible. The original Unix packet filter was designed around a stack-based
    filter evaluator that performs sub-optimally on current RISC CPUs. The BSD Packet
    Filter (BPF) uses a new, register-based filter evaluator that is up to 20 times
    faster than the original design.

    agent then executes the bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.

- en: The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the bulk of which
    are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition, subtraction, shifts, and so
    on) and various sizes of literals and memory reference operations. The bytecode
    interpreter operates strictly on machine-level values — various sizes of integers
    and floating point numbers — and requires no information about types or symbols;
    thus, the interpreter’s internal data structures are simple, and each bytecode
    requires only a few native machine instructions to implement it. The interpreter
    is small, and strict limits on the memory and time required to evaluate an expression
    are easy to determine, making it suitable for use by the debugging agent in real-time
    applications.
