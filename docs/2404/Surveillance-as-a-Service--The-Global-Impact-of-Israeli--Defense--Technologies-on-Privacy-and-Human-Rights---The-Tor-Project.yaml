    for "Border Security Technologies" is projected to exceed $70 billion by 2027,
    up from $48 billion in 2022\. The significant growth in this market is partly
    attributed to the increasing adoption of AI-integrated surveillance towers, made
    possible by Israeli companies who [test repressive technologies on Palestinians](https://therealnews.com/the-weapons-israel-tests-on-palestinians-will-be-used-against-all-of-us).
    This practice allows Israel to refine and demonstrate the effectiveness of its
    products in real scenarios, making them more appealing to international buyers,
    who, again, are often equally oppressive regimes with horrific human rights records.

  zh: 全球市场对于"边境安全技术"（[https://theintercept.com/2024/03/12/dhs-border-towers-ai/](https://theintercept.com/2024/03/12/dhs-border-towers-ai/)）预计到2027年将超过700亿美元，从2022年的480亿美元增长而来。这一市场显著增长部分归因于采用以色列公司开发的AI集成监视塔技术，这些公司在[巴勒斯坦人](https://therealnews.com/the-weapons-israel-tests-on-palestinians-will-be-used-against-all-of-us)身上测试压制技术。这一做法使得以色列能够在真实场景中改进并展示其产品的效果，使其更具吸引力于国际买家，这些买家往往同样是有着可怕人权记录的压制政权。

    apartheid, and genocide have found a lucrative global market, stretching far beyond
    the confines of Palestine. Antony Loewenstein, author of [The Palestine Laboratory](https://www.versobooks.com/products/2684-the-palestine-laboratory),
    notes to Tor: "Since 7 October, 2023, Israel has been live-testing new weapons
    in Gaza including drones, quadcopters, facial recognition tools and surveillance
    tech. The aim isn''t just to kill Palestinians indiscriminately in Gaza but sell
    these weapons of war to a global market. AI-enabled warfare is a [key selling

- en: The export of military systems by Israel reveals a harrowing journey of surveillance
    technologies from local deployments in Palestine to worldwide distribution, with
    a disturbing and alarming trend of normalization and acceptance of the grave human
    rights violations that are committed in the process of their creation and testing.
    The complicity of venture capital in the proliferation of such technologies highlights
    the intricate web of interests that prioritize power and profit over basic human
    rights.

    us all is a global responsibility. There needs to be a consistent and immediate
    call to action for tech workers, companies, civil society organizations, and the
    global community at large to stand firm in our commitment to human rights and
    privacy. We must hold companies accountable, dissect and expose the origins of
    surveillance technologies, and resist their normalization.
