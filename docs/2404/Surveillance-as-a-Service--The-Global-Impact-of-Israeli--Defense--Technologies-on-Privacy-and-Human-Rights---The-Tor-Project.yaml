    of surveillance technology is crucial in protecting human rights worldwide. At
    the Tor Project, we know that it is through collective awareness and action that
    we can all build and contribute to privacy-preserving technologies that aim to
    protect people everywhere from the prevalence of surveillance and oppression.
    It is equally important to hold companies accountable and recognize the source
    and enablers of surveillance tech, especially now as we see these technologies
    being aggressively utilized in the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
