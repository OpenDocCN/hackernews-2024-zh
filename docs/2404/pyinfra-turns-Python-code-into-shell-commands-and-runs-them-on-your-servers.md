# pyinfra turns Python code into shell commands and runs them on your servers

pyinfra turns Python code into shell commands and runs them on your servers. Execute ad-hoc commands and write declarative operations. Target SSH servers, local machine and Docker containers. Fast and scales from one server to thousands.

Think `ansible` but Python instead of YAML, and a lot faster.
