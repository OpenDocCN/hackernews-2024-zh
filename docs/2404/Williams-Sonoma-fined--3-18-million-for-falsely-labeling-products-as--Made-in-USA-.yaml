- en: In a federal court filing on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge
    to sign an order that would fine the luxury home goods company $3.18 million for
    violating a [2020 order](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-approves-final-order-settling-charges-williams-sonoma-inc-made-overly-broad-misleading-made-usa)
    regarding the same false label claims. Williams-Sonoma settled those charges and
    was required to pay $1 million to the FTC, and the following year, it submitted
    a report describing how it had complied with every provision in the order.

    multiple deceptive U.S.-origin claims in the years since — including on three
    products in July 2021, when it filed the compliance order.

    August 2023, involved certain PBTeen mattress pads that were advertised as "crafted
    in America from domestic and imported materials." The federal body said in numerous
    instances, those products were actually "wholly imported" from China.

- en: The FTC said this finding led them to discover six other products on the retailer's
    websites that were advertised as American-made despite either containing foreign
    components or being processed internationally. It states Williams-Sonoma couldn't
    demonstrate the validity of its own claims, and the retailer admitted to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/williams-sonoma-is-fined-by-us-ftc-over-made-usa-claims-2024-04-23/)
    that the allegations made in the complaint were true.

    last year. With brands under its own moniker, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more,
    the company raked in nearly $8.7 billion in sales last year.

    to the company's success.

- en: One survey last year found two-thirds of its 1,000 respondents said they regularly
    sought out "Made in America" products, and 50% said they'd be willing to pay more
    for them. Another survey from the [Reshoring Institute](https://reshoringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/made-in-usa-survey.pdf)in
    2020 found over 69% of respondents preferred American-made products, and more
    than 80% were willing to pay 10% to 20% more for them.
