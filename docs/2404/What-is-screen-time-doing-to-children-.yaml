- en: Two months ago Daisy Greenwell and Clare Fernyhough set up a WhatsApp group
    to discuss how to stave off their young children’s demands for smartphones. After
    they posted about their plans on Instagram, other parents wanted in. Now their
    group, Smartphone-Free Childhood, has more than 60,000 followers debating how
    to keep their children away from the demon devices—a debate they are naturally
    conducting on smartphones of their own.

- en: This group, based in Britain, is not the only one worried about children’s screen
    time. Last month the state of Florida passed a law banning social media for under-14s.
    Britain’s government is reportedly considering a ban on mobile-phone sales to
    under-16s. The concerns are summed up by a recent book by Jonathan Haidt, “The
    Anxious Generation”, which argues that smartphones, and especially the social
    networks accessed through them, are causing a malign “rewiring of childhood”.
