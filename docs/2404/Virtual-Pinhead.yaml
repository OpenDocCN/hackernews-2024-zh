    in Alameda, California was when I became a fan of pinball *art* — mainly the backglass.
    (The backglass is that vertical attract-mode billboard at the rear of the cabinet
    — often screen-printed glass). I’ve enjoyed playing pinball but it never had enough
    appeal such that I would seek out places to play. And I’ve certainly never had
    a strong desire to purchase a pinball cabinet of my own — fill my basement with
    machines.

    dancepads in the past so neither the woodworking nor the electronics aspect of
    building a virtual pinball cabinet seemed too daunting (but, yes, they do involve
    that). But when you do some research and find that people are dedicating as many
    as three displays to the project (and quite a large one for the playfield) it
    is obviously going to involve an outlay of cash. On top of that, if you really
    want the authentic look, you should source actual pinball cabinet legs, a coin
    door, lockdown bar, etc. Never mind a dedicated PC, a sound system, switches and
    various electronic interfaces.

    as possible — in the hardware as well as the software. Not knowing anyone who
    has a virtual pinball cabinet I would have to find out how close these cabinets
    are to the real thing by building one myself. And I think it goes without saying
    that, to the degree you can make virtual pinball seem real, having a single cabinet
    in your basement that can emulate thousands of different pinball machines is kind
    of a space-saver.

    on its own display, and optionally even a dot-matrix display on a third monitor.
    VR is also supported by many tables (but not something that I have tried). If
    you add an accelerometer as one of your USB inputs, VPX supports X and Y nudging
    of the table and applies those impulses to the virtual table and ball physics.
    Yet another framework (DOF) supports driving actual pinball hardware so that you
    can have real solenoids, flashing LEDs and such that are triggered by in-game
    events. (And this was what I was hinting at earlier — people installing actual
    mechanical hardware in their virtual cabinets to get the authentic sound and feel.)

    exciters) arranged in a physical cabinet. Two transducers near the player’s hands
    transmit realistic haptic sensations of flippers slapping the ball, the ball dropping
    down the drain, etc. Another pair further up the playfield deliver the sensation
    of bumpers, the ball hitting the rubber stopper. Even the ball merely rolling
    around the playfield adds an eerie realism.
