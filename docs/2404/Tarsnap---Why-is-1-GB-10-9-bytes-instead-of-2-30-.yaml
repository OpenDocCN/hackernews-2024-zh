    decided that the SI prefix G- meant 10⁹.

- en: 'However, this is a special case: Unlike everything else in the world of computing,
    RAM is addressed in hardware. When you''re designing a piece of silicon, you want
    to have N address lines and have every combination of zeroes and ones map to a
    memory location — to do otherwise would make the logic far more complicated. *Nothing
    else* is addressed this way.'

- en: Finally, even for RAM calling 2^(30) bytes "1 GB" isn't really proper; instead,
    the IEC binary multiplier prefix "Gi-" should be used.

    of the disk space we're paying for!

- en: We all love good conspiracy theories... but really, this isn't about evil megacorporations
    trying to cheat you. Hard drive prices are determined almost entirely by competition
    between manufacturers, so if hard drives were labelled in GiB instead of being
    labelled in GB, we'd be paying the same number of dollars for the same number
    of bytes anyway — if this really was a global conspiracy, it would be one of the
    dumbest conspiracies ever.
