- en: Our washing machine is a Samsung something-something that sends me a notification
    on the [SmartThings app](https://www.samsung.com/be/smartthings/app/) when it
    completes a wash cycle. This is useful since we almost always need to follow up
    a washing cycle with a drying one and maybe even another load of laundry. The
    machine isn’t a combined-washer-dryer so someone has to move the wet clothes from
    our smart washer to our dumb dryer.

    I wouldn’t be writing this post.

    when to go move things to the dryer) I decided to do something similar for the
    dryer. This is especially useful, for example, when the clothes need an extra
    drying cycle or when there are more wet clothes that are waiting in the washer.
    In these times it is useful to know if the dryer has finished a cycle.

    In Home Assistant you create automations via the Automations system. You can turn
    on a light when a motion sensor senses someone in the room; you can turn on the
    vent when humidity reaches a certain level; you can make all the lights turn pink
    and romantic music play over the speakers when it is February 14th and your beloved
    comes home from work. The possibilities are *endless*.

    we *do* something in our Automation. This is where you will want to set up that
    electric rooster crowing when the sun comes up (if you want to build your own

    are using too much electricity.'

    nebulous. At first, I wasn’t entirely sure how to notify myself. I looked into
    [Home Assistant’s Restful Notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify.rest/)
    but could not make it work for the life of me. Then I decided to check if I could
    send an email. I found [Home Assistant’s SMTP Notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/smtp/)
    and decided to give it a go. Again, I could not make it work. It asked me to enter
    my Gmail password in the Home Assistant configuration file, but I was not comfortable
    doing that. I decided to look for another way.

- en: I finally stumbled upon the [Home Assistant iOS App](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ios/)
    which I installed on my phone and pointed to my Home Assistant server. This allowed
    me to send notifications to my phone (my phone became available as a target for
    notifications).

    draw falls below 10 W for at least 5 minutes, and we have consumed more than 100
    W of power just before. This gives me a good indication that the dryer has finished
    a cycle and I should go unload it.

- en: I should mention that my Home Assistant server was not available to the internet
    at that point. All integrations were over local Wi-Fi with firewall rules to prevent
    any external access. I did not have to expose my Home Assistant server to the
    internet to get notifications on my phone since they are both part of a [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet).
    This meant that as long as I had the [Tailscale App](https://tailscale.com/download/ios)
    on my phone and Tailscale VPN enabled, I could access my Home Assistant server
    from anywhere in the world.

    three) similar to [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/access-home-assistant-server-remotely-duckdns-letsencrypt/).
    I won’t go into all the details, but I will say that it was a *pain*. Ultimately,
    after struggling for several days, I gave up. I gave up and decided to go back
    to my girlfriend, head bowed, and give her the bad news.

    Since I was using Tailscale anyway, with a single additional invocation, I could
    have a secure, encrypted, tunnel to my Home Assistant server.

- en: The only caveat to this approach is that Tailscale does not yet support domain
    name handling. So I can’t assign a nice domain name to my Home Assistant server.
    Furthermore, I only have [3 ports available to me](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel#limitations).
    This means that if I were to have other services on that machine that I want to
    expose to the world, I can at most have 2 more, and they will have to be referenced
    by their port numbers.
