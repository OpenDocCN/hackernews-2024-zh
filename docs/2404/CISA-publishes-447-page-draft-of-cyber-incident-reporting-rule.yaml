    and is intended to improve the government’s ability to track incidents and ransomware
    payments. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said the information

    weak points in the U.S. critical infrastructure.

    incidents within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours. The incidents

    the FBI and the agencies in charge of specific sectors.

    threshold outlined in CIRCIA, he said, prompting questions about efforts by businesses
    and organizations to limit the scope of the incident reporting rules. The rule

    says would exclude the vast majority of medical facilities.

    or on purpose, solely went after hospitals or medical device makers under the

    ones than those required for large organizations.
