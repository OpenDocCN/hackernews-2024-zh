- en: Cybersecurity is a central topic for governments around the world. The European
    Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) introduced rules on how software should be
    developed, tested, audited and supported to ensure more secure software. Because
    open source software underpins today’s global digital infrastructure, this has
    a profound impact on many actors in the open source software ecosystem.

    [Python Software Foundation](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/04/new-open-initiative-for-cybersecurity.html),
    Rust Foundation, and Eclipse Foundation are jointly announcing our intention to
    collaborate on the establishment of common specifications for secure software
    development based on existing open source best practices. The working group is
    forming to address the multifaceted challenges of cybersecurity in the open source
    ecosystem, and to demonstrate our commitment to cooperation with and implementation
    of the CRA.

    procedures of the respective open source foundations, and similar documents describing
    best practices. For years, the foundations and communities have created and maintained
    industry best practices for secure software development processes. With these
    best practices as our starting point, we aim to accelerate the development of
    cohesive cybersecurity processes required for regulatory compliance while offering
    a neutral environment for hosting technical discussions with the open source community
    at-large.

    The new working group will be hosted at the Brussels-based Eclipse Foundation
    AISBL under the auspices of the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process. The
    governance of the working group will follow the Eclipse Foundation’s usual member-led
    model but will be augmented by explicit representation from the open source community
    to ensure diversity and balance in decision-making. The deliverables will consist
    of one or more process specifications made available under a liberal specification
    copyright licence and a royalty-free patent licence.
