    University have begun work that is pinpointing changes in cells many years before
    they develop into tumours. The research should help design radically new ways
    to treat cancer, they say.

    just received £11m from an anonymous donor – is focused on finding ways to tackle
    tumours before they produce symptoms. The research will exploit recent discoveries
    which have shown that many people develop precancerous conditions that lie in
    abeyance for long periods.

    or two, before the condition abruptly manifests itself to patients,” said Prof
    Rebecca Fitzgerald, the institute’s director.

    spread through a patient’s body. We need a different approach, one that can detect
    a person at risk of cancer early on using tests that can be given to large numbers
    of people.”

    – a sponge on a string – which has been developed by Fitzgerald and her team.
    It is swallowed like a pill, expands in the stomach into a sponge and is then
    pulled up the gullet collecting oesophagus cells on the way. Those cells that
    contain a protein, called TFF3 – which is found only in precancerous cells – then
    provide an early warning that a patient is at risk of oesophageal cancer and needs
    to be monitored. Crucially, this test can be administered simply and on a wide
    scale.

    present, we are detecting many cancers late and are having to come up with medicines,
    which have become incrementally more expensive. We are often extending life by
    a few weeks at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds. We need to look at this
    from a different perspective.”

    Early [Cancer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer) Institute after the
    Hong Kong philanthropist who has supported other Cambridge cancer research – focuses
    on blood samples. Provided by women as part of past screening services for ovarian
    cancer and kept in special stores, these samples have now been repurposed by the
    institute. “We have around 200,000 such samples and they are a goldmine,” said
    Jamie Blundell, a research group leader at the institute.

    those donors who have subsequently been diagnosed with a blood cancer 10 or even
    20 years after they provided samples, with those who did not develop such conditions.

    than a decade before they start to display symptoms of leukaemia,” said Blundell.
    “That shows there is a long window of opportunity that you could use to intervene
    and give treatments that will reduce the odds of going on to get cancer.”

    step on this ladder, it should be possible to block or hamper further developments.
    The crucial point is that at this early stage there is time for doctors to take
    action and avoid them having to deal with a cancer at a late stage when it has
    spread.

    has investigated men who have had their prostates removed. His team are now developing
    biomarkers that will provide better ways to pinpoint those who are likely to suffer
    poor outcomes from prostate cancer, one of the most common tumours in the UK.

    tests and will be crucial in spotting those who with prostate cancer that is likely

    have an inherited predisposition to tumours – will form a key part of the institute’s
    strategy. In addition, it will focus on finding ways to reduce cancer risks, as
    well as ensuring treatments can be widely administered.

    Fitzgerald said. “However, she lived until she was over 100 and only died recently,
    so we only just got that donation. We want to understand what makes some live
    into very old age while others get cancer, so more people can live as long as
    she did.”
