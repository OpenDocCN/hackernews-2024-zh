- en: Caltech has reinstated its requirement for prospective students to submit SAT
    or ACT test scores as part of their application for admission to undergraduate
    study. The test requirement takes effect immediately, which means that all students
    who apply to Caltech beginning in fall 2024 and would enroll in fall 2025 are
    required to report test scores as part of their application.

- en: This decision, which follows a recommendation from a faculty Advisory Committee
    on Undergraduate Admissions Policy, reflects the judgment that standardized testing
    provides admissions officers and faculty reviewers useful information about academic
    preparedness as part of a holistic consideration of all prospective students.
    In reinstating the standardized testing requirement, Caltech reaffirms its commitment
    as a community of scientists and engineers to using all relevant data in its decision-making
    processes.

- en: The committee found that, even with a testing moratorium in place, an increasing
    number of applicants have been completing standardized tests each year, with more
    than 95 percent of the most recently enrolled class having taken standardized
    exams. But test scores have not been visible to the admissions office until after
    final admissions decisions have been made. In the coming admissions cycle, test
    scores will be used as an additional data point in the context of a student's
    unique circumstances and experiences. The faculty Advisory Committee noted that,
    "We think it is critical that our admissions office and the faculty who are reviewing
    applicants have available to them all the information that could shape their understanding
    of a prospective student's readiness for our rigorous academic programs."

    face of academic challenges, and who bring a diversity of experiences and viewpoints
    to our community. "We are proud of the students we've enrolled over the last several
    years and confident in the steps we've taken to enhance our ability to identify
    students who will succeed at – and beyond – Caltech," says Provost David Tirrell.

- en: The Institute paused its SAT and ACT test requirement in 2020 when it implemented
    a moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced access to standardized
    exams for students worldwide. The moratorium was extended in 2021, and then again
    in 2022\. The Institute's decision ends the moratorium, which originally was set
    to expire in 2025.
