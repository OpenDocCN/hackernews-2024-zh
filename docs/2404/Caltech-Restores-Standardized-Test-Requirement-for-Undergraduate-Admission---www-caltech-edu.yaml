- en: This decision, which follows a recommendation from a faculty Advisory Committee
    on Undergraduate Admissions Policy, reflects the judgment that standardized testing
    provides admissions officers and faculty reviewers useful information about academic
    preparedness as part of a holistic consideration of all prospective students.
    In reinstating the standardized testing requirement, Caltech reaffirms its commitment
    as a community of scientists and engineers to using all relevant data in its decision-making
    processes.

  zh: 这一决定是根据本科招生政策顾问委员会的建议作出的，认为标准化考试提供给招生官和教员有关学术准备情况的有用信息，作为对所有潜在学生进行全面考虑的一部分的判断。加州理工学院恢复标准化考试要求，重申作为科学家和工程师社区的承诺，利用所有相关数据进行决策过程。
- en: The committee found that, even with a testing moratorium in place, an increasing
    number of applicants have been completing standardized tests each year, with more
    than 95 percent of the most recently enrolled class having taken standardized
    exams. But test scores have not been visible to the admissions office until after
    final admissions decisions have been made. In the coming admissions cycle, test
    scores will be used as an additional data point in the context of a student's
    unique circumstances and experiences. The faculty Advisory Committee noted that,
    "We think it is critical that our admissions office and the faculty who are reviewing
    applicants have available to them all the information that could shape their understanding
    of a prospective student's readiness for our rigorous academic programs."

  zh: 委员会发现，即使在实施了考试禁令的情况下，每年仍有越来越多的申请者完成了标准化测试，最近一届入学的学生中超过95%的学生参加了标准化考试。但是考试成绩直到最终录取决定后才对招生办公室可见。在即将到来的招生周期中，考试成绩将作为学生独特情况和经历的一个额外数据点。顾问委员会指出：“我们认为我们的招生办公室和审阅申请者的教员必须获得所有可能影响他们对潜在学生准备情况理解的信息，这一点至关重要。”
- en: The Institute is dedicated to attracting and educating the most talented and
    promising students in the world – students with deep interests in science, engineering,
    and mathematics who have the ability, energy, and resilience to flourish in the
    face of academic challenges, and who bring a diversity of experiences and viewpoints
    to our community. "We are proud of the students we've enrolled over the last several
    years and confident in the steps we've taken to enhance our ability to identify
    students who will succeed at – and beyond – Caltech," says Provost David Tirrell.

- en: The Institute paused its SAT and ACT test requirement in 2020 when it implemented
    a moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced access to standardized
    exams for students worldwide. The moratorium was extended in 2021, and then again
    in 2022\. The Institute's decision ends the moratorium, which originally was set
    to expire in 2025.
