- en: At an event in London on Tuesday, Meta confirmed that it plans an initial release
    of Llama 3 — the next generation of its large language model used to power generative
    AI assistants — within the next month.

    getting close to launch](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-platforms-to-launch-small-versions-of-llama-3-next-week).

    we hope to start rolling out our new suite of next-generation foundation models,
    Llama 3,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs. He described what
    sounds like the release of several different iterations or versions of the product.
    “There will be a number of different models with different capabilities, different
    versatilities [released] during the course of this year, starting really very
    soon.”

- en: Meta has been scrambling to catch up to OpenAI, which took it and other big
    tech companies like Google by surprise when it launched ChatGPT over a year ago
    and the app went viral, turning generative AI questions and answers into everyday,
    mainstream experiences.

- en: Meta has largely taken a very cautious approach with AI, but that hasn’t gone
    over well with the public, with previous versions of Llama criticized as too limited.
    (Llama 2 was [released publicly in July 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/meta-releases-llama-2-a-more-helpful-set-of-text-generating-models/).
    The first version of Llama was not released to the public, yet it still leaked
    online.)

- en: Llama 3, which is bigger in scope than its predecessors, is expected to address
    this, with capabilities not just to answer questions more accurately but also
    to field a wider range of questions that might include more controversial topics.
    It hopes this will make the product catch on with users.

- en: “Our goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI be the most useful assistant
    in the world,” said Joelle Pineau, vice president AI Research. “There’s quite
    a bit of work remaining to get there.” The company did not talk about the size
    of the parameters it’s using in Llama 3, nor did it offer any demos of how it
    would work. It’s expected to have about 140 billion parameters, compared to 70
    billion for the biggest Llama 2 model.

    a different philosophical approach to how AI should develop as a wider technology.
    In doing so, Meta is hoping to play into wider favor with developers versus more
    proprietary models.

    to other generative AI beyond text generation. The company is not yet releasing
    Emu, its image generation tool, Pineau said.

    3, it does have some significant generative AI skeptics in the house.

- en: Yann LeCun, the celebrated AI academic who is also Meta’s chief AI scientist,
    took a swipe at the limitations of generative AI overall and said his bet is on
    what comes after it. He predicts that will be joint embedding predicting architecture
    (JEPA), a different approach both to training models and producing results, which
    Meta has been using to build more accurate predictive AI in the area of [image
    generation](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/).
