- en: Owners of the [Tesla Cybertruck](https://insideevs.com/reviews/710824/tesla-cybertruck-review-2024/)
    are coming forward with an issue that could potentially turn the stainless steel
    trapezoid into a 6,800-pound land missile. At least one owner has posted a video
    outlining their experience with a fault in the design of the Cybertruck's accelerator
    pedal.

    into a seam in the driver's side footwell, causing the pedal to remain pressed.

- en: Tesla has run the gauntlet with Cybertruck launch problems. From incorrectly
    installed door latches to awful panel gaps, and plenty of reports of loss of power,
    critics are rightfully slamming the brand for its quality control. This accelerator
    pedal problem, if widespread, could be Tesla's biggest safety doozy for the Cybertruck
    to date.

- en: Fortunately, the owner who experienced this issue was able to stop the acceleration
    by pressing the brake, which cuts power to the drive motors. However, as soon
    as the driver lifted their foot off of the brake, they reported that the truck
    immediately accelerated at full throttle. Kind of scary considering the [6,800-pound
    truck can sprint from 0-60 mph in under 2.7 seconds](https://insideevs.com/news/708502/tesla-cybertruck-cyberbeast-quarter-mile-0-60-mph/).

    delay, nor confirmed if the reported stop-sale is due to the accelerator pedal
    issue. Likewise, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not published
    any complaints that would indicate a pedal defect or current recall.

    residue" present from production. However, it''s worth also calling out that there
    [doesn''t appear to be any fasteners holding the pedal cover on](https://service.tesla.com/docs/Cybertruck/ServiceManual/en-us/GUID-18A00B65-4539-4123-BAAD-663990B8B98E.html),

    possibly a product of cost savings. *Drive Tesla* also reports that Tesla anticipates
    readying a fix to resume deliveries as early as [April 20](https://insideevs.com/news/650999/tesla-elon-musk-not-guilty-420-private-case/).'

    in the truck hitting a pole in early April. The owner posted to the [*Cybertruck
    Owners Club*](https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/brake-malfunction-hit-light-pole.14130/)
    forum where they were met with skepticism until they posted photos of the accident.

    in an official recall. The entire situation is reminiscent of [Toyota's 2.3 million
    vehicle recall in 2010](https://www.cars.com/articles/toyota-recalls-2-3-million-vehicles-over-sticking-accelerator-pedal-1420663220496/)
    due to the accelerator pedal potentially becoming mechanically stuck and resulting
    in unintended acceleration. Though many of those claims were overblown and the
    issue was often due to misuse and improper floor mat placement, the incident was
    a crushing blow to Toyota's reputation and bottom line for several years.
