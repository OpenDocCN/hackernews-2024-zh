# Tesla whistleblower in legal battle over braking-safety concerns - BBC News

Another Tesla whistleblower, [Lukasz Krupski](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67591311), claimed to have had a similar, unrelated experience after emailing Mr Musk over concerns about working conditions at Tesla’s Norway headquarters.

And Ms Balan says other Tesla staff may be “afraid to speak up”.

Her case will eventually be heard in the California Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.

It is her only chance of professional vindication, Ms Balan believes.

"I don’t want to give up my career," she says.

"And I know that if I’m not winning this, it doesn’t matter how good I am.

“Everybody will look at what Tesla say about [me], so my career is gone.

"I do not want that.”

Mr Musk's leadership style is notoriously unconventional - but some of those to have worked for him say he gets results.

Dolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013,  previously told BBC News he was an "incredible leader".

"If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't be accomplishing the things that he is," she said, in 2022.

"Yes, it's exhausting to work for Elon.

"But I think it's a proving ground like nothing else."

US lawyer Gordon Schnell, from the firm Constantine Cannon, says a rising number of technology-sector workers are becoming whistleblowers.

The stakes are so high because tech products have "such a wide impact on the world," he says.

"It really touches all of our lives," he says.

But the advice of Mr Schnell, who specialises in representing whistleblowers, is to explore every possible option before going public with any claims.

"There are so many protected channels in so many different industries that a whistleblower can take, where they can get confidential concerns to the proper government agencies that are best suited to address those concerns," he says.
