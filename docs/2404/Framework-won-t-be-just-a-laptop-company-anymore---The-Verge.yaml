- en: Today, Framework is [*the* modular repairable laptop company](/23664746/framework-laptop-excitement-vpr-matrix-history-nostalgia).
    Tomorrow, it wants to be a consumer electronics company, period. That’s one of
    the biggest reasons [it just raised another $18 million in funding](https://frame.work/blog/frameworks-series-a-1-and-community-participation)
    — it wants to expand beyond the laptop into “additional product categories.”

- en: Framework CEO Nirav Patel tells me that has always been the plan. The company
    originally had other viable ideas beyond laptops, too. “We chose to take on the
    notebook space first,” he says, partly because Framework knew it could bootstrap
    its ambitions by catering to the PC builders and tinkerers and Linux enthusiasts
    left behind by big OEMs — and partly because it wanted to go big or go home.

    I ask.

- en: He won’t even say if they’ll make less or more of a splash than laptops. Framework
    might choose an “equally difficult” category or might instead try something “a
    bit smaller and simpler to execute, streamlined now that we have all this infrastructure.”

    or skew more toward the everyday consumer. (Patel [recently suggested to Jason
    Carman](https://youtu.be/gGdSnGgQnAc?si=-X7rCyAbOKYwmcpG&t=659) that Framework
    might adapt its marketing to reach more everyday audiences.)

    raises funding for a new product category, it builds a roadmap of how to continue
    that product year after year. “Every time a product lands on a roadmap, we’re
    not going to say: ‘That’s repairable, that’s it.’ The first product is the first
    stake in the ground.”'

    which has carried on for [three generations of components](/23911664/framework-laptop-13-2023-amd-review).
    Framework’s $18 million Series A in 2022 paid for the [Framework Laptop 16](/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review).
    Now, it’s getting another $18 million for its next expansion.

    shrink over time — it’s just that some cohorts, like industrial designers, don’t
    need to stick around after a design is locked.'

  zh: 我突然想到：在进入新领域之前，Framework的团队是否需要专注于一些悬而未决的笔记本问题？但Patel表示，公司的笔记本团队不会随着时间而缩小——只是像工业设计师这样的一些小组在设计锁定后就不需要继续留在这里。

    the idea is to let you keep the same chassis year after year as you upgrade and
    repair parts.)

- en: Today, Framework has about 50 employees, and it plans to expand to 60 before
    the end of the year, with “a bit of additional team growth” in 2025\. It’s a small
    company that needs to partner to actually produce hardware; I gather that its
    laptop partner, Compal, for example, does a bit more than just run the assembly
    lines.

  zh: 如今，Framework拥有大约50名员工，并计划在年底前扩展到60名，并且在2025年还将有“一些额外的团队增长”。这是一个需要与他人合作才能实际生产硬件的小公司；我了解到，例如其笔记本合作伙伴Compal不仅仅是运行装配线。
- en: 'So if you did want to sleuth out what Framework’s cooking next, you might want
    to take a look at the web of relationships that the company’s building because
    there’s an explicit hint about that in its press release: “We’ve had a number
    of early partnership discussions with other startups in our investors’ portfolios,”
    one line reads.'

  zh: 因此，如果你想要探究Framework接下来的计划，可能需要看一看公司正在构建的关系网络，因为其新闻稿中明确提到了这一点：“我们已经与我们投资组合中的其他初创公司进行了一些早期的合作讨论。”
- en: Another linepoints out that Cooler Master, which designed the thermal solution
    inside the Framework Laptop 16 and is now a direct investor, might help Framework
    build new products, too. “We have additional collaborations with the Cooler Master
    team in incubation now.”
