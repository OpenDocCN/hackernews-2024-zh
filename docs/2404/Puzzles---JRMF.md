# Puzzles - JRMF

> 来源：[https://jrmf.org/puzzle/](https://jrmf.org/puzzle/)

Every JRMF puzzle is hands-on, play-based, and standards-aligned.

We design our activities to have a low floor so that anyone can find a way to engage and a high ceiling so that everyone can find a meaningful challenge.

All of our puzzles come with free festival guides that help you use our activities at home, in the classroom, or during math festivals.
