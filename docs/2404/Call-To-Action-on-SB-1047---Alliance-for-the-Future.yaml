- en: California legislators, under the influence of Effective Altruism activists,
    are trying to sneak through a disastrous bill for open-source AI and the technology
    industry generally.

- en: SB 1047 creates an unaccountable Frontier Model Division that will be staffed
    by EAs with police powers, and which can throw model developers in jail for the
    thoughtcrime of doing AI research. It’s being fast-tracked through the state Senate.
    Since many cloud and AI companies are headquartered in California, this will have
    worldwide impact.

    but you need to do them soon, ideally this week. Non-California residents are
    very welcome to comment, and indeed many of the supporters are not from California.

    One of key arguments being advanced is that this is “pro-little guy”, so if you’re
    involved in the open source movement, are a startup founder, or an investor, heavily
    cite your experience and how the bill affects you personally.

    is uncontroversial. Based on [recent public reactions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNQupN5LEil96qVqkl9pLbcgdYY92iGveZO9Hu0MsMo/edit),
    we estimate that this is unpopular in the CA tech industry by at least a 10:1
    ratio, however, if this message does not get to Sacramento, it will not be perceived
    this way.
