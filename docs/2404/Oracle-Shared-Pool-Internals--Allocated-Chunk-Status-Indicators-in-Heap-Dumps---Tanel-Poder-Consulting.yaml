- en: Over time, Oracle has been adding more contextual information into each allocated
    heap memory chunk, to make it easier to see what for your heap memory is used.
    This instrumentation is used for private (PGA,UGA,etc) heaps too, but this article
    focuses only on shared pool heaps.

    allocations that are used for “session pages” that hold various tiny memory structures
    like library cache lock (and pin in older DB versions) that a session must allocate
    when accessing library cache objects. The NNN is in this case is not showing some
    hash value, but the SID of the allocating session.

    *recurrent* end of the heap LRU replacement list after the [SEPARATOR marker in
    shared pool heap dumps](/posts/oracle-shared-pool-list-chunk-position-in-lru-list/)
    (2020). That would tell you which existing cursors have been executed more than
    once (pinned at least 3 times - once for loading the object into cache + at least
    2 executions).

- en: You might wonder what’s the difference between C and T above. It looks like
    Oracle immediately uses the transient flag (T) for objects like library cache
    object handle (KGLHD - the entry point to any library cache object structure,
    data dictionary cache objects KQR PO/SO), but for actual library cache object
    “payload”, like cursors, PL/SQL objects, it first uses the (C) flag, which then
    gets changed to (R) if executed for more than once.

- en: Shared pool LRU list scan must find an unpinned *recreatable* chunk (the first
    chunk in an allocated heap) and it frees this leading recreatable chunk first
    (the `ds=0x13e3d9d48` points to the beginning of the heap). Then it goes on to
    freeing the remaining chunks of this heap, it will walk through a linked list
    of any further allocations “chained” to the leading chunk (marked as freeable)
    and frees these as a result. The heap manager frees entire subheaps when it finds
    its leading recreatable chunk to be unpinned - there’s no point in freeing only
    the leading 4kB of a 100kB SQL Area heap and leaving the rest of it in some partially
    allocated unusable state.
