    of what looked like burn-ins.
  prefs: []

    me quite a bit. And since there are people reading this whose eyebrows went up
    at the “two cables”, I thought I’d use this as an occasion to write about [my
    desk and computer setup](https://thorstenball.com/my-setup/) a little bit.

    there’s a setting in the driver to permanently turn it on but last time I did

    the microphone didn’t stay in place and the arm would also cover the laptop on
    the side and I thought there has to be a better way. Turns out there is.'

    easily. And I always, always have noise-cancelling on. I don’t listen to a lot
    of music anymore when working, but in a house with two small kids the barely-perceptible
    hum of the active noise cancelling doing its job is one of the sweeter sounds
    in my life.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But after years of using the QC-25 (and loving them!) it started to feel a little
    bit dumb to recharge the batteries every couple of days. I would constantly have
    batteries lying around here and the charger would always be plugged in. “Don’t
    they build these headphones with built-in batteries nowadays?” I thought and then
    bought the Bose 700.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Bose 700 were great, but they’re too tight and after wearing them for ten
    hours per day, my ears would start to sweat (did *you* expect that there’d be
    this much sweat in this post? I didn’t) and things would become uncomfortable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    via USB-c and, bingo, that’s exactly what they are and why I love them. Very comfortable,
    great-sounding (to my sweaty ears) headphones.

- en: For years I’ve used Apple’s Magic Trackpad and loved it. Then I developed some
    pain in my right hand and went looking for a mouse. At first I used a cheap, vertical
    mouse that I found on Amazon and that was *okay* but it wasn’t great.

    a long flight - sorry vertical mice users.)'

- en: Then I bought a gaming mouse from Steelseries. I can’t remember the name but
    I’m sure it also sounded like an Iron Maiden album. That impressed me. It felt
    comfortable and precise and a lot of the annoyances I’ve had with the Magic Trackpad
    or other mice just went away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then the scroll wheel broke and I bought the (I wish I could play some music
    here:) *Razer DeathAdder* and it changed my life. It’s so good. The *click*, man.
    Just that click alone makes you reconsider why you ever used a trackpad at all.
    Then you notice how light it is, then you notice that the cable is also very light
    and basically feels wireless, and then you notice that pointing at stuff on the
    screen and resizing things and selecting stuff is suddenly easier and, oh my god,
    the two buttons on the side allow you to go forward and back in the browser? I
    don’t know how else to put it, but after years of using only trackpads switching
    to a very good mouse feels like waking from a bad dream. Try it.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, there are better cameras, and I’m curious to try one, but I think in webcam
    land there are these ~100 bucks webcams on one side, then there’s a very wide
    and deep valley, and then there are the professional cameras on the other side
    for which you pay hundreds if not thousands of bucks. I don’t know whether I want
    to cross that valley. I’ve heard that you have to use HDMI adapters and battery
    adapters and that the cameras overheat and don’t reliably work and it all sounds
    like a (sing it with me:) big pain in the butt. So I’m sticking with this one
    until someone tells me “buy this one, it’s twice as good and you don’t ever have
    to worry about it.”

    right is an Elgato Ring Light (that name probably would’ve been enough for you
    to distinguish them, huh).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I first bought the Ring Light because I thought I could get away with only a
    single light. Quickly realized that when you have glasses and you mount a ring
    light right behind the camera it constantly looks like you have two small ring
    lights in your face. Stay away from ring lights if you have glasses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So then I ordered the smaller Key Light Air and moved both to the sides of the
    desk. Now they work pretty well. I can adjust the light on my phone, or in the
    menu bar on macOS, or through Home Assistant.

    you should get a good light. Consistent lighting makes a huge difference.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s also why I bought these. I don’t have strong lights in this room, so
    in Zoom calls or in video recordings, the lighting and thus the quality of my
    webcam video was determined by what I had open on screen. If I had a blank, white
    page open everything would look crisp and properly lit. When I then switched to
    the dark terminal, quality dropped.

    day or what application I have maximized. Recommended move.

    can connect to it via Bluetooth and tell it to keep my coffee at a certain temperature
    and the Ember app even allows you to connect to “multiple devices” and you can
    create an account to sync your “device settings” and I can configure the color
    of the light on the outside of the mug — yes, it’s all very ridiculous. But! (No,
    only one T in this one)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I won it in a quiz at Sourcegraph (which is also why there’s a Sourcegraph
    logo on it), so no, I didn’t spend money on a smart mug, but yes, I’ve been using
    it every day since then and the battery is often empty and I forget to recharge
    it but when it’s charged and I forget to drink my coffee and get a push notification
    that says “Your coffee has reached perfect temperature” I feel a bit embarrassed
    but also happy.

    on it, it’s *fucking heavy*. It’s so heavy that the package arrived and the guy
    handed it to me I thought “what the fuck did I order?! this can’t be the keyboard.”
    It’s so heavy that it never, ever moves, which is great.

- en: I don’t know what else to say here, though. I think I kinda lost my appetite
    for mechanical keyboards over the years. I started using a KUL ES-87 in 2015\.
    Back then with Cherry MX Blue switches. I loved it and also convinced my colleagues
    to switch to mechanical keyboards (quite the sound in that office). Then I got
    a Topre and didn’t fall in love that much. Then, years later, I got a cheap one
    off of Amazon and that was also nice but started to fall apart, so now I got this
    Keychron Q3.

    it.
  prefs: []

    were all connected to the monitor. I could then use a single USB-C cable to connect
    the monitor and peripherals to a MacBook, while also charging the MacBook. The
    desktop computer was connected to the monitor via DisplayPort and a separate USB-A-to-USB-C
    cable was used to connect the USB-Hub part of the monitor to the desktop computer.
    That means I had a small USB-C cable attached to the monitor and I could then
    plug either the MacBook or the desktop computer into this USB-C cable to connect
    one or the other.'
