- en: When Nigerian edtech startup, Flexisaf, decided to cut costs earlier this year,
    it realized it needed to reduce its spending on technology.

- en: One of the company’s biggest costs was the money it paid Google to use its Workspace
    — a collection of Google products including Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and
    Docs. Flexisaf had used Google Workspace since 2010, but with 100 employees now,
    it was becoming too expensive for the small business.

- en: In March, Flexisaf found a solution to its problem in Zoho, an Indian company
    that offered similar products as Google, but at a fraction of the price. Flexisaf
    has started the process of migrating to Zoho — once that is completed, it will
    save the company around 8,000,000 naira ($6,960) a year, Sa’ad Shehu, Flexisaf’s
    people and talent manager, told *Rest of World*.

    and drive adoption of the other features within the coming months,” Shehu said.

- en: Zoho, a lesser-known rival of Google and Microsoft in the enterprise software
    space, has been stepping up in Africa as an affordable alternative to the global
    giants. The company has hired local staff, introduced payment options in local
    currencies, and even sponsored a cricket tournament to dig its heels into the
    market. But even as it has seen some early success, African tech experts say Zoho
    needs to strengthen its branding and engage with the local tech community to give
    serious competition to its larger rivals in the future.

- en: There is a tremendous opportunity for “digital transformation” in African countries,
    Praval Singh, vice president of marketing and customer experience at Zoho, told
    *Rest of World*. “A lot of companies are adopting digital, either for the first
    time or they’re on that path of making their businesses more efficient using technology,”
    he said. *Rest of World* spoke to seven startups in Nigeria, Kenya, and South
    Africa that have ditched Google and switched to Zoho’s products over the past
    year or so.

    operations in Africa, with one salesperson each in South Africa and Nigeria. Now,
    it has about 60 employees across the continent, Zoho’s regional manager for Africa,
    Andrew Bourne, told *Rest of World*. Besides work management tools like the equivalent
    of Gmail or Google Drive, Zoho sells software for customer relationship management,
    human resource management, and accounting, among other products.

    Amazon, leading carmaker Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Indian airline SpiceJet, and
    food delivery platform Zomato. Zoho’s advantage over its bigger rivals is that
    it does not run ads or sell customers’ data to third parties, Singh said.

    from South Africa rose by 73%, Bourne said*.* The company refused to disclose
    how many users it had in Africa or how much revenue it had made from the continent.
    A Zoho spokesperson told *Rest of World* its clients include Kenyan lifestyle
    app Pesapal, South African fintech Payfast, and events ticketing portal Quicket.
    The company’s combined annual revenue has crossed $1 billion.

    local developer ecosystem as Google does in Africa, according to Prosper Otemuyiwa,
    a Nigerian software engineer and co-founder of ForLoop, an African nonprofit developer
    community. “They don’t have enough goodwill yet,” Otemuyiwa said. “[Google] has
    built an ecosystem of tools and support, [and] users are likely going to hesitate
    before clocking out of [it], just as people would rather pay for an Apple product
    just to remain within that ecosystem of tools.”

- en: In 2021, Zoho started allowing African companies to pay for its software in
    local currencies. This decision has been a major reason for Zoho’s success in
    Africa as it allowed customers and potential clients to avoid regulatory [hurdles
    around dollar spending](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/517128-more-nigerian-banks-limit-foreign-currency-spending-on-naira-cards.html?tztc=1),
    Kehinde Ogundare, country director for Nigeria, told *Rest of World*. “We saw
    the rise in adoption of Zoho technology in Nigeria when we started pricing in
    local currency and building a local support team.”

    Zoho will win,” Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of edtech startup AltSchool
    Africa, told *Rest of World.* “They have great products and pricing — what’s left
    is to build trust and engage in strong marketing activities to completely shake
    out the big guys.” Yusuf, who has co-founded three startups, said all his companies
    now use at least one Zoho product.

    health-tech startup Wellahealth, told *Rest of World*. Ikpeme had opted for Zoho
    over Google when he launched his company in 2016\. “We know that it’s difficult
    enough to access dollars, and if you can, you might want to reserve it for other
    services that you can’t pay for locally,” he said. But the low pricing may not
    be enough for Zoho to dethrone its larger rivals. Users told *Rest of World* the
    company’s products lack sophistication.

    bit stale. They also need to have better mobile apps,” said Vijay Anand, an Indian
    angel investor and founder whose startups use Zoho. When he tested Zoho’s new
    Slack-like service, Cliq, Anand was disappointed by the lack of emojis and GIFs.
    “It’s the one happy thing the teams have,” he said.

    products in Africa. “There’s no strong community to leverage when you run into
    a problem,” he said. “Google has that in abundance and across the continent in
    terms of developers, startups, and IT professionals generally.”

    and venture capital firms to tackle that challenge, Veerakumar Natarajan, the
    company’s regional manager for East Africa, told *Rest of World*. In Kenya and
    South Africa, for instance, it has partnered with startup incubator hubs [like
    J-Hub Africa](https://cioafrica.co/zoho-signs-partners-with-j-hub-africa-innovation-hub/)
    and Silulo Foundation, respectively, Natarajan said.

    portfolio, with a spread of 55-plus apps, is the most prolific in the industry,
    owing to our bullish focus on [research and development].” He said some customers
    might use only Zoho, while others might use it along with Google’s products to
    meet different needs. “It takes each of a kind to make a village,” said Singh.
