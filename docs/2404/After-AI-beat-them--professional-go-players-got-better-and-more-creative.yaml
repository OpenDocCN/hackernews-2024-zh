- en: 'After a few years, the weakest professional players were better than the strongest
    players before AI. The strongest players pushed beyond what had been thought possible.
    EDIT: as Gwern points out, I’m misreading the graph. The graph shows the average
    move quality across the whole Go player population. The lines are not the population,
    but simply the uncertainty around the mean. So moves were getting better, but
    we do not know how that was distributed in the population.'

  zh: 几年后，最弱的职业选手比AI出现之前最强的选手还要强。最强的选手突破了以前被认为是可能的极限。编辑：正如Gwern指出的那样，我误读了图表。图表显示整个围棋选手群体的平均走法质量。这些线条不是人口，而仅仅是平均值周围的不确定性。因此，走法确实在变得更好，但我们不知道这在人群中如何分布。

    No. They really were getting better.

- en: And it wasn’t simply that they imitated the AI, in a mechanical way. They got
    more creative, too. There was an uptick in historically novel moves and sequences. [Shin
    et al](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2214840120) calculate about
    40 percent of the improvement came from moves that could have been memorized by
    studying the AI. But moves that deviated from what the AI would do also improved,
    and these “human moves” accounted for 60 percent of the improvement.

    计算表明，大约40%的进步来自那些可以通过学习AI而记住的走法。但是，与AI的走法不同的走法也得到了改善，这些“人类走法”占了进步的60%。

    This is a common pattern. Until Roger Bannister ran the 4-minute mile, the best
    runners clustered just above 4 minutes for decades. A few months later Bannister
    was no longer the only runner to do a 4-minute mile. These days, high schoolers
    do it. The same story can be told about the French composer Pierre Boulez. His
    music was considered unplayable until recordings started circulating on YouTube
    and elsewhere. Now it is standard repertoire at concert houses.

- en: The recent development in Go suggests that superhuman AI systems can have this
    effect, too. They can prove something is possible and lift people up. This doesn’t
    mean that AI systems will not displace humans at many tasks, and it doesn’t mean
    that humans can always adapt to keep up with the systems—in fact, the human Go
    players are not keeping up. But the flourishing of creativity and skills tells
    us something about what might happen at the tail end of the human skill distribution
    when more AI systems come online. As humans learn from AIs, they might push through
    blockages that have kept them stalled and reach higher.

- en: Another interesting detail about the flourishing in Go, which is teased out
    in [this paper by Shin, Kim, and Kim](https://escholarship.org/content/qt6q05n7pz/qt6q05n7pz.pdf),
    is that the trend shift actually happened 18 months *after*AlphaGo. This coincides
    with the release of [Leela Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leela_Zero), an
    open source Go engine. Being open source Leela Zero allowed Go players to build
    tools, like Lizzie, that show the AI’s reasoning when picking moves. Also, by
    giving people direct access, it made it possible to do massive input learning.
    This is likely what caused the machine-mediated unleash of human creativity.

    When DeepBlue beat the chess world champion Kasparov in 1997, it was assumed this
    would be a blow to human chess players. It wasn’t. Chess became more popular than
    ever. And the games did not become machine-like and predictable. Instead, top
    players like Magnus Carlsen became [more inventive than ever](https://www.wsj.com/articles/magnus-carlsen-ian-nepomniachtchi-world-chess-championship-computer-analysis-11639003641).

- en: Our potential is greater than we realize. Even in highly competitive domains,
    like chess and GO, performance can be operating far below the limit of what is
    possible. *Perhaps* AI will give us a way to push through these limits in more
