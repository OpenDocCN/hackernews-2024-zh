    [a handy command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py) for
    downloading a subset of the Overture dataset. Usage is simple:'

- en: With the new tool, I wanted to revisit the exercise of creating a POI database
    with Overture. [Last time](https://gist.github.com/dbreunig/bd13dd99d6d708560bfcca9f45c9fb29),
    it took us 162 lines of wrangling with the `aws-cli` and `duckdb` to get us something
    usable. How many lines will it take us this time?

    data, outputting `geojsonseq` (or new-line delimited GeoJSON), and removing the
    output arguments. With no output specified, place data is output to `stdout`,
    which we can pipe to Simon Willison’s [geojson-to-sqlite](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jan/31/geojson-sqlite/),
    taking care to specify we’re using new-line delimited GeoJSON and that the primary
    key is `id`.'

    to figure out the bounding box. Which is kind of a pain. Thankfully, LLMs are
    spookily good at producing bounding boxes for towns, cities, states, and regions.
    So lets incorporate Simon’s [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) tool to
    generate our bounding box (here, with OpenAI’s `gpt-3.5`), using command substitution:'
