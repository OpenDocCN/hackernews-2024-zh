    hint when it has determined that nowhere in the runtime system is there another
    reference to the tuple except for the reference used for the `update_record` instruction.
    In other words, from the **compiler’s** point of view, if the runtime system were
    to directly update the existing record without first copying it, the observable
    behavior of the program would not change. As soon will be seen, from the **runtime
    system’s** point of view, directly updating the record is not always safe.

    which is a divide-and-conquer multiplication algorithm invented in the 1960s.

    were modified to take advantage of a 128-bit integer data type on 64-bit CPUs
    when supported by the C compiler.

    That reduced the execution time for the `binary_to_integer/1` benchmark to about
    0.3 seconds.
