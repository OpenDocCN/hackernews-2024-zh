    "will be a waste of Japan's national assets" as the country sells its U.S. dollars
    to buy yen. Koll said the yen could further weaken to 200-220 against the greenback,
    if nothing fundamentally changes.

    as such unless the Fed signals that rate cuts are back on the table, thereby weakening
    the U.S. dollar, or if Ueda signals that domestic demand-pull inflation must be
    contained.
