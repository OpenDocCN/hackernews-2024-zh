    was even a real thing. The AI-powered, Teenage Engineering-designed device came
    out of nowhere to become [one of the biggest stories at CES](/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date),
    promising a level of fun and whimsy that felt much better than some of the more
    self-serious AI companies out there. CEO Jesse Lyu practically promised the world
    in this $199 device.

    I went to the swanky TWA Hotel in New York City, along with a few hundred reporters,
    creators, and [particularly enthusiastic R1 buyers](/2024/1/10/24033498/rabbit-r1-sold-out-ces-ai).
    After a couple of hours of photo booths, specialty cocktails, and a rousing keynote
    and demo from Lyu — in which he made near-constant reference to and fun of [the
    Humane AI Pin](/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review) — we all got our R1s to take home.
    I’ve been using mine ever since, and I have some thoughts. And some questions.'

    are the salient specs: it’s about three inches tall and wide and a half-inch thick.
    It weighs 115 grams, which is about two-thirds as much as the iPhone 15\. It has
    a 2.88-inch screen, runs on a 2.3GHz MediaTek MT6765 processor, and has 128 gigs
    of storage and four gigs of RAM. It has a speaker on the back, two mics on the
    top, and a SIM card slot on the side right next to the USB-C charging port. It
    only comes in one color, a hue Rabbit calls “leuchtorange” but is often known
    as “brilliant orange” or “luminous orange.” It’s definitely orange, and it’s definitely
    luminous.'

    Instead of sitting on top or in the back, the R1’s camera sits in a cutout space
    on the right side of the device, where it can spin its lens to face both toward
    and away from you.'

    nice. Not luxurious, or even particularly high-end, just silly and fun. Where
    Humane’s AI Pin feels like a carefully sculpted metal gem, the R1 feels like an
    old-school MP3 player crossed with a fidget spinner. The wheel spins a little
    stiffly for my taste but smoothly enough, the screen is a little fuzzy but fine,
    and the main action button feels satisfying to thump on.'

    it does a solid job with basic AI questions: it gave me lots of good information
    about this week’s NFL draft, found a few restaurants near me, and knew when Herbert
    Hoover was president. This is all fairly basic ChatGPT stuff, and there’s some
    definite lag as it fetches answers, but I much prefer the interface to the Humane
    AI Pin — because there’s a screen, and you can see the thing working so the AI
    delays don’t feel quite so interminable.'

    Hoover是总统的时间。这都是相当基础的ChatGPT内容，虽然在获取答案时有一定的延迟，但我更喜欢这种界面而不是Humane AI Pin — 因为有一个屏幕，你可以看到设备在工作，所以AI的延迟并不感到无法忍受。

- en: Almost immediately, though, I started running into stuff the R1 just can’t do.
    It can’t send emails or make spreadsheets, though Lyu has been demoing both for
    months. Rabbithole is woefully unfinished, too, to the point I was trying to tap
    around on my phone and it was instead moving a cursor around a half-second after
    every tap. That’s a good reminder that the whole thing is running on a virtual
    machine storing all your apps and credentials, which still gives me security-related
    pause.
  id: totrans-split-17

  zh: 不过，几乎立即我就开始遇到R1无法处理的事情。它无法发送电子邮件或制作电子表格，尽管Lyu已经演示了数月。Rabbithole也极不完善，以至于我试图在手机上点击，它却在每次点击后半秒钟内移动光标。这很好地提醒我，整个系统运行在虚拟机上，存储所有您的应用程序和凭据，这仍然让我对安全性感到担忧。
- en: 'Oh, and here’s my favorite thing that has happened on the R1 so far: I got
    it connected to my Spotify account, which is a feature I’m particularly excited
    about. I asked for “Beyoncé’s new album,” and the device excitedly went and found
    me “Crazy in Love” — a lullaby version, from an artist called “Rockabye Baby!”
    So close and yet so far. It doesn’t seem to be able to find my playlists, either,
    or skip tracks. When I said, “Play The 1975,” though, that worked fine and quickly.
    (The speaker, by the way, is very much crappy Android phone quality. You’re going
    to want to use that Bluetooth connection.)'

  zh: Oh，到目前为止，我在R1上最喜欢的事情就是：我成功将其连接到了我的Spotify账户，这是我特别激动的一个功能。我请求播放“碧昂丝的新专辑”，设备兴奋地找到了“疯狂的爱情”
    — 是摇篮曲版本，来自名为“Rockabye Baby!”的艺术家。如此接近又如此遥远。它似乎也无法找到我的播放列表，或者跳过曲目。但当我说“播放The 1975”时，却工作得很好且迅速。（顺便说一句，这个扬声器质量非常糟糕，像是劣质的安卓手机。你最好使用蓝牙连接。）
- en: The R1’s Vision feature, which uses the camera to identify things in the scene
    around you, seems to work fine as long as all you want is a list of objects in
    the scene. The device can’t take a photo or video and doesn’t seem to be able
    to do much else with what it can see.

  zh: R1的Vision功能利用摄像头识别周围场景中的物体，似乎可以正常工作，只要你想要的是场景中物体的列表。但设备无法拍照或录像，并且似乎不能利用其所见做任何其他事情。

- en: 'When you’re not doing anything, the screen shows the time and that bouncing
    rabbit-head logo. When you press and hold the side button to issue a command,
    the time and battery fade away, and the rabbit’s ears perk up like it’s listening.
    It’s very charming! The overall interface is simple and text-based, but it’s odd
    in spots: it’s not always obvious how to go back, for instance, and you only get
    to see a line or two of text at a time at the very bottom of the screen, even
    when there’s a whole paragraph of answer to read.'

  zh: 当你没有做任何事情时，屏幕显示时间和那只弹跳的兔子头标志。当你按住侧面按钮发出命令时，时间和电量会逐渐消失，兔子的耳朵会竖起来，就像它在倾听一样。这非常迷人！整体界面简单且基于文本，但在某些地方有些奇怪：比如，如何返回并不总是显而易见，而且即使有一整段答案可读，你一次也只能看到一两行文字，仅限于屏幕底部。
- en: 'Rabbit’s roadmap is ambitious: Lyu has spent the last few months talking about
    all the things the R1’s so-called “Large Action Model” can do, including learning
    apps and using them for you. During last night’s event, he talked about opening
    up the USB-C port on the device to allow accessories, keyboards, and more. That’s
    all coming… eventually. Supposedly. For now, the R1’s feature set is much more
    straightforward. You can use the device to play music, get answers to questions,
    translate speech, take notes, summon an Uber, and a few other things.'

    USB-C 端口，以允许配件、键盘等的连接。所有这些……最终都会到来。据说。目前，R1 的功能集更为直接。您可以使用设备播放音乐，获取问题的答案，进行语音翻译，记笔记，召唤
    Uber，以及其他一些功能。

- en: That means there’s still an awful lot the R1 can’t do and a lot I have left
    to test. (Anything you want to know about, by the way, let me know!) I’m particularly
    curious about its battery life, its ability to work with a bad connection, whether
    it heats up over time, and how it handles more complex tasks than just looking
    up information and ordering chicken nuggets. But so far, this thing seems like
    it’s trying to be less like a smartphone killer and more like the beginnings of
    a useful companion. That’s probably as ambitious as it makes sense to be right
    now — though Lyu and the Rabbit folks have a lot of big promises to eventually
    live up to and not a lot of time to do so.

  zh: 这意味着 R1 仍然有很多事情不能做，我还有很多测试工作要做。（顺便说一句，如果有什么想知道的，请告诉我！）我对它的电池续航能力特别感兴趣，以及它在网络连接不佳时的工作能力，它是否会随时间变热，以及它如何处理比简单查找信息和订购鸡块更复杂的任务。但到目前为止，这个东西看起来似乎并不试图成为智能手机杀手，而更像是一个有用的伴侣的开端。这可能是目前看起来合理的雄心壮志——尽管
    Lyu 和兔子团队有许多大承诺要兑现，但时间不多。
