    was even a real thing. The AI-powered, Teenage Engineering-designed device came
    out of nowhere to become [one of the biggest stories at CES](/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date),
    promising a level of fun and whimsy that felt much better than some of the more
    self-serious AI companies out there. CEO Jesse Lyu practically promised the world
    in this $199 device.

    I went to the swanky TWA Hotel in New York City, along with a few hundred reporters,
    creators, and [particularly enthusiastic R1 buyers](/2024/1/10/24033498/rabbit-r1-sold-out-ces-ai).
    After a couple of hours of photo booths, specialty cocktails, and a rousing keynote
    and demo from Lyu — in which he made near-constant reference to and fun of [the
    Humane AI Pin](/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review) — we all got our R1s to take home.
    I’ve been using mine ever since, and I have some thoughts. And some questions.'

    are the salient specs: it’s about three inches tall and wide and a half-inch thick.
    It weighs 115 grams, which is about two-thirds as much as the iPhone 15\. It has
    a 2.88-inch screen, runs on a 2.3GHz MediaTek MT6765 processor, and has 128 gigs
    of storage and four gigs of RAM. It has a speaker on the back, two mics on the
    top, and a SIM card slot on the side right next to the USB-C charging port. It
    only comes in one color, a hue Rabbit calls “leuchtorange” but is often known
    as “brilliant orange” or “luminous orange.” It’s definitely orange, and it’s definitely
    luminous.'

    of a smartphone: it has most of the same parts, just laid out really differently.
    Instead of sitting on top or in the back, the R1’s camera sits in a cutout space
    on the right side of the device, where it can spin its lens to face both toward
    and away from you.'

    nice. Not luxurious, or even particularly high-end, just silly and fun. Where
    Humane’s AI Pin feels like a carefully sculpted metal gem, the R1 feels like an
    old-school MP3 player crossed with a fidget spinner. The wheel spins a little
    stiffly for my taste but smoothly enough, the screen is a little fuzzy but fine,
    and the main action button feels satisfying to thump on.'

    asked me to sign up for an account at Rabbithole, the R1’s web portal. I did that,
    scanned a QR code with the R1 to get it synced up, and immediately did a software
    update. I spent that time logging in to the only four external services the R1
    currently connects to: Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney.'

    it does a solid job with basic AI questions: it gave me lots of good information
    about this week’s NFL draft, found a few restaurants near me, and knew when Herbert
    Hoover was president. This is all fairly basic ChatGPT stuff, and there’s some
    definite lag as it fetches answers, but I much prefer the interface to the Humane
    AI Pin — because there’s a screen, and you can see the thing working so the AI
    delays don’t feel quite so interminable.'

    It can’t send emails or make spreadsheets, though Lyu has been demoing both for
    months. Rabbithole is woefully unfinished, too, to the point I was trying to tap
    around on my phone and it was instead moving a cursor around a half-second after
    every tap. That’s a good reminder that the whole thing is running on a virtual
    machine storing all your apps and credentials, which still gives me security-related
    pause.

    it connected to my Spotify account, which is a feature I’m particularly excited
    about. I asked for “Beyoncé’s new album,” and the device excitedly went and found
    me “Crazy in Love” — a lullaby version, from an artist called “Rockabye Baby!”
    So close and yet so far. It doesn’t seem to be able to find my playlists, either,
    or skip tracks. When I said, “Play The 1975,” though, that worked fine and quickly.
    (The speaker, by the way, is very much crappy Android phone quality. You’re going
    to want to use that Bluetooth connection.)'

    around you, seems to work fine as long as all you want is a list of objects in
    the scene. The device can’t take a photo or video and doesn’t seem to be able
    to do much else with what it can see.

    rabbit-head logo. When you press and hold the side button to issue a command,
    the time and battery fade away, and the rabbit’s ears perk up like it’s listening.
    It’s very charming! The overall interface is simple and text-based, but it’s odd
    in spots: it’s not always obvious how to go back, for instance, and you only get
    to see a line or two of text at a time at the very bottom of the screen, even
    when there’s a whole paragraph of answer to read.'

    all the things the R1’s so-called “Large Action Model” can do, including learning
    apps and using them for you. During last night’s event, he talked about opening
    up the USB-C port on the device to allow accessories, keyboards, and more. That’s
    all coming… eventually. Supposedly. For now, the R1’s feature set is much more
    straightforward. You can use the device to play music, get answers to questions,
    translate speech, take notes, summon an Uber, and a few other things.'

    to test. (Anything you want to know about, by the way, let me know!) I’m particularly
    curious about its battery life, its ability to work with a bad connection, whether
    it heats up over time, and how it handles more complex tasks than just looking
    up information and ordering chicken nuggets. But so far, this thing seems like
    it’s trying to be less like a smartphone killer and more like the beginnings of
    a useful companion. That’s probably as ambitious as it makes sense to be right
    now — though Lyu and the Rabbit folks have a lot of big promises to eventually
    live up to and not a lot of time to do so.
