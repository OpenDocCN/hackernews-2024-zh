- en: About two years ago the term “quiet quitting” was added to the workplace vocabulary.
    It refers to employees who are no longer willing to go the extra mile for an employer
    and it was widely considered a knock-on effect of the pandemic.

  zh: 大约两年前，“安静辞职”这个术语被添加到职场词汇中。它指的是那些不再愿意为雇主付出额外努力的员工，广泛被认为是大流行的副作用。
- en: In fact, quiet quitting is not new. Employees have always had the option to
    reduce their effort if they felt undervalued or overworked. What the pandemic
    did was bring this resistance right out in the open as many resented the extent
    to which work had seeped into their personal lives during lockdown. Once a semblance
    of normality returned, they started kicking back.

  zh: 实际上，安静辞职并不新鲜。员工一直有减少工作量的选择，如果他们感到被低估或过度工作。大流行所做的是将这种抵抗情绪公之于众，因为许多人对封锁期间工作侵入其个人生活的程度感到不满。一旦正常生活恢复，他们开始反抗。
- en: What employers have found since is that quiet quitting is worse than the inconvenience
    of having an employee leave. Quiet quitters are hard to handle, both on the job
    and in performance reviews, because they continue to complete their assigned workload
    to the same (often high) standard, giving their managers an uneasy feeling but
    nothing specific to complain about.

  zh: 雇主们发现，安静地辞职比忍受员工离职的不便更糟糕。安静的辞职者很难处理，无论是在工作中还是在绩效评估中，因为他们继续按照同样（通常是高）的标准完成分配给他们的工作量，这让他们的经理感到不安，但却找不到具体的抱怨点。
- en: Quiet quitting is subtle, unspoken and slippery to tie down, but a straw poll
    of managers suggests it is a lot more prevalent post-pandemic. “You always had
    those who did their 9-5 but not a minute more and never chipped in if there was
    a crisis. But it’s become like a creeping malaise with a sort of passive-aggressive
    undercurrent that’s really exhausting,” says one manager in charge of a large
    finance team in a busy multinational business.

  zh: 安静辞职是微妙的、无言的，难以捉摸，但经理们的一项小范围调查表明，它在大流行后更为普遍。“你总是有那些按时完成工作但不会多做一分钟的人，如果有危机，他们也不会插手。但现在它变成了一种潜在的被动攻击性，真的很令人筋疲力尽，”一位负责繁忙跨国企业大型财务团队的经理说。
- en: “Their attitude also has an impact on colleagues who are affected by the downbeat
    vibe and having to pick up the slack. Post-Covid, people are definitely less prepared
    to start early or work late and less willing to put their hand up if there’s something
    extra to be done.”

    their employment obligations to the letter if not the spirit and if an organisation
    is constantly relying on employees to put in extra hours to make the business
    model work, it is going to be in big trouble when that goodwill runs out and it
    can hardly be surprised that it does.

- en: Job creep, where people end up doing tasks outside the original scope of their
    role, is a fact of life. However, part of the problem now is that many employers
    failed to “recalibrate for more normal times” when the pandemic was over, say
    organisational behaviour expert Prof Anthony C Klotz, from UCL School of Management
    in London and Mark C Bolino, professor of international business at the University
    of Oklahoma’s Price College of Business.

- en: Writing in the Harvard Business Review, the duo say that, “after more than two
    years of pandemic-fuelled firefighting, during which more and more activities
    that might once have been considered ‘above and beyond’ have become expected parts
    of workers’ jobs, the benefits of citizenship behaviour may increasingly feel

- en: '“Going above and beyond can come at a cost for employees,” they add. “In a
    healthy organisation, these costs are typically counterbalanced by benefits such
    as increased social capital, wellbeing and career success. The quiet quitting
    trend suggests that employees are increasingly feeling that this exchange has
    become unbalanced: employers are demanding additional effort from workers without
    investing in them enough in return.”'

- en: Klotz and Bolino say that employers need to review employees’ responsibilities
    and decide what is core and what is extra. They also suggest that the withdrawal
    of effort may be linked to fatigue because employees don’t feel supported – something
    that could be tackled relatively easily by asking them (individually) what supports
    would help. Being flexible is important here as people have different needs depending
    on age, responsibilities outside work and life stage.

  zh: Klotz 和 Bolino 表示，雇主需要审查员工的责任，并决定什么是核心内容，什么是额外的内容。他们还建议，员工的努力撤退可能与疲劳有关，因为他们感觉没有得到支持——通过询问他们（个别地）什么支持会有所帮助，可以相对轻松地解决这个问题。在这里灵活是很重要的，因为人们根据年龄、工作之外的责任和生活阶段有不同的需求。
- en: “As a manager in my 50s, I’ve been around the block a few times and I have a
    certain sympathy for the quiet quitters,” the finance manager says. “But it’s
    hard to deal with while keeping everyone else engaged. In particular it’s a challenge
    to ensure that the first job employees on the team don’t assume this behaviour
