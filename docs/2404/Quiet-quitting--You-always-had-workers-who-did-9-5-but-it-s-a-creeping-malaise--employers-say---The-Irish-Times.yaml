- en: About two years ago the term “quiet quitting” was added to the workplace vocabulary.
    It refers to employees who are no longer willing to go the extra mile for an employer
    and it was widely considered a knock-on effect of the pandemic.

    reduce their effort if they felt undervalued or overworked. What the pandemic
    did was bring this resistance right out in the open as many resented the extent
    to which work had seeped into their personal lives during lockdown. Once a semblance
    of normality returned, they started kicking back.

    of having an employee leave. Quiet quitters are hard to handle, both on the job
    and in performance reviews, because they continue to complete their assigned workload
    to the same (often high) standard, giving their managers an uneasy feeling but
    nothing specific to complain about.

    of managers suggests it is a lot more prevalent post-pandemic. “You always had
    those who did their 9-5 but not a minute more and never chipped in if there was
    a crisis. But it’s become like a creeping malaise with a sort of passive-aggressive
    undercurrent that’s really exhausting,” says one manager in charge of a large
    finance team in a busy multinational business.

    vibe and having to pick up the slack. Post-Covid, people are definitely less prepared
    to start early or work late and less willing to put their hand up if there’s something
    extra to be done.”

    their employment obligations to the letter if not the spirit and if an organisation
    is constantly relying on employees to put in extra hours to make the business
    model work, it is going to be in big trouble when that goodwill runs out and it
    can hardly be surprised that it does.

    role, is a fact of life. However, part of the problem now is that many employers
    failed to “recalibrate for more normal times” when the pandemic was over, say
    organisational behaviour expert Prof Anthony C Klotz, from UCL School of Management
    in London and Mark C Bolino, professor of international business at the University
    of Oklahoma’s Price College of Business.

    years of pandemic-fuelled firefighting, during which more and more activities
    that might once have been considered ‘above and beyond’ have become expected parts
    of workers’ jobs, the benefits of citizenship behaviour may increasingly feel
    outweighed by the costs”.

    healthy organisation, these costs are typically counterbalanced by benefits such
    as increased social capital, wellbeing and career success. The quiet quitting
    trend suggests that employees are increasingly feeling that this exchange has
    become unbalanced: employers are demanding additional effort from workers without
    investing in them enough in return.”'

- en: Klotz and Bolino say that employers need to review employees’ responsibilities
    and decide what is core and what is extra. They also suggest that the withdrawal
    of effort may be linked to fatigue because employees don’t feel supported – something
    that could be tackled relatively easily by asking them (individually) what supports
    would help. Being flexible is important here as people have different needs depending
    on age, responsibilities outside work and life stage.

    certain sympathy for the quiet quitters,” the finance manager says. “But it’s
    hard to deal with while keeping everyone else engaged. In particular it’s a challenge
    to ensure that the first job employees on the team don’t assume this behaviour
    is the norm.

    they go off like firecrackers if there’s any suggestion that something like the
    hybrid working arrangements might change. It’s more related to the pressures they’re
