  prefs: []

- en: The number of skilled pragmatists in any given company is much larger than people
    realize and, therefore, represents a HUGE opportunity. But almost by definition,
    they are less visible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Skilled pragmatists are too smart to wade into conflicts or political maneuvering.
    They work within the system. They are *under-challenged *and *bored *at workbut
    are resourceful enough to scratch those itches in other ways. They aren't lazy—doing
    the bare minimum and stopping—but they also don't go "above and beyond" because
    they are inherently skeptical that it is worth it. They are very reliable, but
    to the point where they are conveniently (to them) invisible. Occasionally, they
    show flashes of brilliance to remind people they've got the chops, but not so
    often that it throws them into the lion's den.

- en: Importantly, these employees resist managerial efforts to "engage and challenge"
    them. They don't need to be engaged—they are fairly balanced. And they'd love
    to be challenged if working within the existing system wasn't so difficult. "I
    have my projects outside of work to be challenged; thank you very much." So, the
    normal playbook doesn't work. It feels condescending and paternalistic.

    the privilege of being ABLE to be somewhat detached yet still earn a living. Many
    people do not enjoy the privilege of fading into the background and are subject
    to much more scrutiny, stress, gaslighting, and doubt.)*'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very clear to Maria that her team is spinning in circles. She watches
    with mild amusement as managers struggle in vain to push back on reactive feature
    requests. She's skilled and makes decent progress with the spaghetti codebase
    the team inherited, but she knows she could be a lot more productive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At standups, Maria doesn't waste energy calling out things beyond her (and the
    team's) immediate control. Yes, software engineering is her passion, but she's
    not about to burn a lot of social capital by rocking the boat—she sees what happens
    to *those *people. She has some co-workers who have extremely strong careerist
    tendencies. In some cases, they game the performance management system to the
    Nth degree to the detriment of customer outcomes. She knows moving up takes a
    bit longer, but she has also had good luck shifting companies every couple of
    years to get a raise and promotion. It's almost like new hiring managers sense
    she has been under-utilized.

    savvy enough to navigate the system—which has the byproduct of perpetuating whatever
    dysfunctions exist. Why change things when the people in power positions are adept

    is it to be paid to be a problem/puzzle solver and build/make things with other
    similarly curious people that can impact humans? That's incredible. Sometimes
    I have to pinch myself.

    Many companies are filled with talented people who love to solve problems, yet
    we're only scratching the surface regarding harnessing their potential.

    sure why—maybe humans will be human, maybe it is power and money, maybe it is
    the natural entropy of companies and products—but many of the problems we face
    at work are very addressable. Yet, for whatever reason, it has to be difficult.
