    With each element in the periodic table containing at least one electron, you
    can therefore safely assume there are at least 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
    electrons in the observable universe as well.

    who outlined his thoughts in a conversation with fellow physicist [Richard Feynman](https://www.iflscience.com/feynmans-reversed-sprinkler-puzzle-finally-has-a-solution-72685),
    there is only one electron – it just looks like there are a lot more because it
    is moving forward and backward in time.

    electrons. Electrons, like other elementary particles, are indistinguishable from
    each other. They have the same negative charge, the same mass, and the [same spin](https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2011/mar/17/1#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20the%20mass%20of,it%20has%20this%20particular%20mass.).
    Swap one electron for another, and you [won't be able to tell](https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics/Advanced_Quantum_Mechanics_(Kok)/12%3A_Multiple_Particle_States/12.1%3A_Indistinguishable_Particles).

    identical in their charge, mass, and spin. Strangely, they are identical to electrons,
    aside from their positive charge. It was these factors that led Wheeler to suggest
    that electrons and positrons were actually just one particle, negatively charged
    as it goes forward in time, and positively charged as it goes backward in time.

    Professor Wheeler, in which he said, ''Feynman, I know why all electrons have
    the same charge and the same mass''," Feynman said in his 1965 [Nobel Lecture](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/feynman/lecture/).'

    telephone, ''suppose that the world lines which we were ordinarily considering
    before in time and space – instead of only going up in time were a tremendous
    knot, and then, when we cut through the knot, by the plane corresponding to a
    fixed time, we would see many, many world lines and that would represent many
    electrons, except for one thing. If in one section this is an ordinary electron
    world line, in the section in which it reversed itself and is coming back from
    the future we have the wrong sign to the proper time – to the proper four velocities
    – and that’s equivalent to changing the sign of the charge, and, therefore, that
    part of a path would act like a positron''.”'

    a truly incomprehensible number of times. While this would be a fun way to explain
    why electrons and positrons share properties, it is incredibly unlikely to be
    correct. As Feynman points out, there are not nearly as many positrons as electrons
    in the universe, and there is [more](https://theconversation.com/cern-discovery-sheds-light-on-the-great-mystery-of-why-the-universe-has-less-antimatter-than-matter-147226#:~:text=Scientists%20believe%20that%20in%20the,preference%20to%20matter%20over%20antimatter.)
    matter than antimatter. If positrons and electrons were the same elementary particle
    going forward and backward in time, you'd expect there to be an even number.

    was the explanation that Wheeler offered, pretty unconvincingly. Though a thought
    experiment, and likely not [supposed to be taken seriously](https://interestingengineering.com/science/could-every-electron-in-the-universe-be-the-same-one),
    the phone call had a lasting impact on Feynman, writing a [paper](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429493249-10/theory-positrons-feynman)
    on how positrons can be described as if they are electrons moving backward in
    time.'

    as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented
