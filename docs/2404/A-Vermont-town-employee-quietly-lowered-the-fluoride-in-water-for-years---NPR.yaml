- en: RICHMOND, Vt. — Residents of a small community in Vermont were blindsided last
    month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride
    levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children's dental
    health and transparent government — and highlighting the enduring misinformation
    around water fluoridation.

    said at a water commission meeting this week that her dentist recently found her
    two kids' first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar, but noted
    that her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town's
    water should be doing the trick.

    its addition to municipal water can amount to an unwanted medication; some communities

    its recommended amount](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/04/27/402579949/feds-say-its-time-to-cut-back-on-fluoride-in-drinking-water)

    decay by about 25%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
    which reported in 2018 that 73% of the U.S. population was served by water systems
    with adequate fluoride to protect teeth. So for some people in Richmond, it was
    a shock to hear their water wasn't meeting the standard.
