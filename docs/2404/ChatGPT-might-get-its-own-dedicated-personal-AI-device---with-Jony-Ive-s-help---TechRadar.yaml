- en: Sam Altman, the CEO of [ChatGPT](https://www.techradar.com/sg/tag/chatgpt) developer
    [OpenAI](https://www.techradar.com/sg/tag/openai), is reportedly seeking funding
    for an AI-powered, personal device – perhaps not unlike the [Humane AI Pin](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/humanes-ai-pin-is-a-screenless-wearable-smartphone-thats-straight-out-of-black-mirror)
    – and ex-Apple design guru Jony Ive is apparently getting involved as well.

    (via [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/jony-ive-sam-altman-ai-device/)),
    and the rumor is that Altman and Ive have started a "mysterious company" together
    to make the device a reality. The report doesn't mention much about the hardware,
    except to say it won't look like a smartphone.

    having an AI assistant running on a device means you don't necessarily need a
    display and traditional apps – the artificial intelligence engine can do everything
    for you, no tapping or scrolling required.

    is clearly a major undertaking we're talking about. It's not clear how much involvement
    OpenAI would have, but its ChatGPT bot would most likely be used on the new device.

    Times](https://www.ft.com/content/4c64ffc1-f57b-4e22-a4a5-f9f90a7419b7) reported
    that Altman and Ive were "in talks" to get funding for a new project from SoftBank,
    a Japanese investment company.'

    which might be tapped to provide components for the hardware – which can't run
    entirely on AI cloud magic of course. All this is speculation for the time being,
    however.

    a [Samsung](https://www.techradar.com/sg/tag/samsung) chip factory, so all the
    indications are that he's planning something in terms of physical hardware. It
    remains to be seen just how advanced this hardware is though.

    led the design teams responsible for the iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook, so whatever
    is in the pipeline, we can expect it to look stylish. We can also expect to hear
