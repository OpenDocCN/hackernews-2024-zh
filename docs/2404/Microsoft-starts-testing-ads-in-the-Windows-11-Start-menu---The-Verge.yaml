    shows file recommendations, to suggest apps from the Microsoft Store.

    will not apply to commercial devices (devices managed by organizations),” says
    [Microsoft in a blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/04/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3495-beta-channel/).

- en: The app promotions can be disabled in the Settings section of Windows 11, but
    it appears that Microsoft will enable these by default. Microsoft is seeking feedback
    on the changes, so it’s possible the company could decide to ditch these ads in
    development builds of Windows 11 if there’s enough feedback that suggests they’re
    not going to be a popular addition.

- en: Microsoft started testing [ads inside the File Explorer of Windows 11](/2022/3/15/22979251/microsoft-file-explorer-ads-windows-11-testing)
    last year before disabling the experiment in beta versions of Windows 11\. Microsoft
    has been experimenting with ads inside Windows for more than 10 years. There are
    already promotional spots [on the Windows 10 lock screen](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8514345/windows-spotlight-lock-screen-with-ads) and [in
    the Start menu](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/16/11682164/microsoft-windows-10-promoted-apps-start-menu-anniversary-update),
    so it’s not exactly surprising to see them appear in Windows 11, too.

    Microsoft might be forced to not include these ads on shipping versions of Windows
    11\.
