    complex system that [maintains a balance in real time](https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-what-electric-grid)

    spike in power use as devices in many homes turn back on. The grid also needs

    state’s public utility commission [approved them in 2012](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/psps/)
    as a way to mitigate the potential impacts of utility equipment-induced wildfires,
    and it has issued regulations guiding when utilities can de-energize power lines.

    detailed reports within 10 days after each planned blackout.
