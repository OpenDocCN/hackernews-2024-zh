    instance of my Apple ID mysteriously being locked. First, my iPhone wanted me
    to enter the password again, which I thought was the “normal” thing it has done
    every few months, almost since I got it. But after doing so it said that my account
    was locked.

    I had Stolen Device Protection enabled, and I was not at one of my familiar locations.
    *I was at home.* But I went to **Settings ‣ Privacy & Security ‣ Location Services
    ‣ System Services ‣ Significant Locations** to check, and for some reason the
    *only* location in the list was the grocery store that I go to once every two
    weeks. It didn’t figure out the location of the home/office where the phone spends
    nearly all its time and which is identified as Home in Apple Maps, Contacts, and
    Find My.

    unlocking didn’t work. It had me enter the password, texted a code to my phone,
    and then wanted me to enter the password again, but the sheet was broken. I typed
    the password and clicked **Sign In**, and the button stayed grayed out, showed
    a spinner, and then stopped, but it neither accepted the password nor showed an
    error. It just got stuck with **Sign In** disabled. Isn’t the new System Settings
    great?

    the exact same procedure as before to unlock my account, but this time it let
    me do so using my Mac’s password instead of sending a code to the iPhone. And
    this time the final sheet asking for my Apple ID password worked.

    consequences. You cannot use iCloud email, IMessage, or FaceTime without this
    account. You cannot access personal or even work documents if you store them on
    iCloud. And you cannot use third-party apps that depend on iCloud, such as a calendar

    address as the login for any important accounts. This also makes me think twice
    about using Apple Passwords as my authenticator (actual passwords are in PasswordWallet).
    Hopefully, I would still be able to use the authenticator if my account were locked

    to discard cached data for seemingly no reason.

    owe users open communication at the very least. Equally as important, Apple owes
    its own tech support personnel open and better communication on these problems.

    can find those specifics in blog posts [here](https://warnercrocker.com/2023/10/05/time-for-apple-to-come-clean-about-icloud/),
    [here](https://warnercrocker.com/2023/05/09/apple-icloud-migraines/), [here](https://warnercrocker.com/2023/07/25/a-possible-answer-to-those-apple-migraines/),
    and [here](https://warnercrocker.com/2023/05/22/apple-icloud-migraines-continue/).
    That said, having to re-log into Messages after this event leads me to continue
    to believe that Apple has deeply rooted issues with iCloud. I’ve been fighting
    these issues (and Apple) for well over a year.

    Yesterday, I tried to send a message from my mac.com email address, which is my
    Apple ID, using Apple’s servers, in MailMate. Because Apple BARELY supports (very
    begrudgingly) third-party mail clients, you need to define not one, but TWO app-specific
    passwords for MailMate, one for receiving mail and one for sending mail.'

    my Apple ID password. I then enter my NEW password (the one I reset last week),
    and… it tells me it’s the wrong password! I try again and again and… same thing.

    time logging in with my Apple ID and the (same) new password (instead of the passkey).
    It works (wait, didn’t you just say the password was wrong?), but… now Apple says
    my account has been locked again!
