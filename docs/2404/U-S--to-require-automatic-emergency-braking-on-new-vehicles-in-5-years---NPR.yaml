- en: DETROIT — In the not-too-distant future, automatic emergency braking will have
    to come standard on all new passenger vehicles in the United States, a requirement
    that the government says will save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of
    injuries every year.

- en: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration unveiled the final version
    of the new regulation on Monday and called it the most significant safety rule
    in the past two decades. It's designed to prevent many rear-end and pedestrian
    collisions and reduce the roughly 40,000 traffic deaths that happen each year.

    and is likely to help curb some of the problems that have surfaced with driver-assist

- en: Although about 90% of new vehicles have the automatic braking standard now under
    a voluntary agreement with automakers, at present there are no performance requirements,
    so some systems may not be that effective. The new regulations set standards for
    vehicles to automatically stop and avoid hitting other vehicles or pedestrians,
    even at night.

    of roadway deaths that we just lived with for my entire lifetime is through these
    kinds of technologies," said Buttigieg, who is 42\. "We need to make sure we set
    high performance standards."'

- en: The regulation, which will require additional engineering to bolster software
    and possibly add hardware such as radar, won't go into effect for more than five
    years. That will give automakers time to bolster their systems during the normal
    model update cycle, NHTSA said.

    in 2020 dollars, or $82 per vehicle. But Buttigieg said it will save 362 lives
    per year, prevent about 24,000 injuries and save billions in property damage.

    of them at speeds up to 62 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour). Also they
    must apply the brakes automatically at up to 90 mph (145 kph) if a collision with
    vehicle ahead is imminent.

    stop and avoid a pedestrian at 31 mph to 40 mph (50 kph to 64 kph) depending on
    the pedestrian's location and movement.

    have to meet the requirements. That's up to the automakers. But in testing of

    — met the standards.
