- en: DETROIT — In the not-too-distant future, automatic emergency braking will have
    to come standard on all new passenger vehicles in the United States, a requirement
    that the government says will save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of
    injuries every year.

- en: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration unveiled the final version
    of the new regulation on Monday and called it the most significant safety rule
    in the past two decades. It's designed to prevent many rear-end and pedestrian
    collisions and reduce the roughly 40,000 traffic deaths that happen each year.

    a voluntary agreement with automakers, at present there are no performance requirements,
    so some systems may not be that effective. The new regulations set standards for
    vehicles to automatically stop and avoid hitting other vehicles or pedestrians,
    even at night.

    and possibly add hardware such as radar, won't go into effect for more than five
    years. That will give automakers time to bolster their systems during the normal
    model update cycle, NHTSA said.

    per year, prevent about 24,000 injuries and save billions in property damage.

    vehicle ahead is imminent.
