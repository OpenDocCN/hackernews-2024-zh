- en: Updated Will Roku TVs of the future throw up targeted ads on the screen whenever
    you pause a video? We hope not but...
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Roku-assigned [patent application](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230388589A1/en),
    filed in the US as 20230388589A1 and titled "HDMI customized ad insertion," outlines
    a fairly convoluted system that ultimately shows adverts on your telly or some
    other display whenever some kind of pause in playback is detected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The proposed patent, published at the end of last year and spotted now, describes
    a display device that can show advertising after identifying a pause in the video
    content from an HDMI-connected media device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Crucially, it says the display and media hardware can be the same device, ie:
    a smart TV like that from Roku. There are two ways of looking at this design:
    A way for standalone televisions, monitors, and projectors to show their own ads
    during a pause, and a way for integrated smart displays to do the same.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would presumably also mean ads can run in the middle of a gaming session
    or a video being played via a PC, if the monitor or TV in use were to adopt this
    tech.
  prefs: []

- en: Roku even helpfully attached a flow chart to the patent application that outlines
    all the cases where an ad would be played. These include not only the detection
    of a pause button press but also instances where the TV infers a pause from various
    criteria.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These criteria include checking whether new frames are being created, if there's
    any audio, and even if a pause symbol is on the screen. In those instances, the
    TV or display will then begin serving an ad that goes right on top of whatever
    is on the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The patent does not specify whether these ads will be in the form of still images,
    audio, or video, though Roku does detail that they will be served based on whatever
    content is playing on the screen. The patent details lots of ways it will analyze
    content to determine what ad to show, such as video metadata, watermarks, and
    the audio. Checking the source device and even the software application running
    are options too, perhaps coming in handy when the device in question is a gaming
    console or some other purpose-made device with a specific name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The draft patent never mentions artificial intelligence when discussing content
    recognition, so its detection may be pretty rudimentary. However, since the TV
    likely has to communicate with some outside server to get the ad, any AI-powered
    part of the process may be done in the cloud away from this design seeking patent
    protection.
  prefs: []

- en: While this kind of ad injection isn't something that currently happens with
    smart TVs, it's technically already possible. Back in 2015, Samsung accidentally
    set its Australian TVs to play [muted Pepsi commercials over and over](https://www.theregister.com/2015/02/11/samsung_fixes_advert_interruption_problem/)
    on top of movies played through Plex Media Server. Although the ads were clearly
    a bug, it does indicate that Samsung was working on something similar to what
    is outlined in the Roku patent.

- en: Of course, this is all at the patent application stage, it may never happen,
    and plenty of patents never make it to actual products. We've asked Roku to comment
    on whether the feature could become reality. ®
