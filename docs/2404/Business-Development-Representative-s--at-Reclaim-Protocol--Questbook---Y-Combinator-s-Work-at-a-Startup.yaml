    only make decisions, but also make them fast and execute on it.

    a lot. At any point of time there are atleast 3 projects that are in the research

    will skip this and will get away with it", you'd be in the wrong place.

    interact with the Reclaim Protocol, we use appclips. Appclips are a feature in
    phones that are oft overlooked. Making an app that opens instantaneously without
    having to install a new app by visiting the store unlocks a whole new design space.
    Ours is an appclip - which means there are strict limits on package size. So,
    we're not only optimizing the run time of the zkproofs, but we are also trying
    to optimize the package size at the same time.
