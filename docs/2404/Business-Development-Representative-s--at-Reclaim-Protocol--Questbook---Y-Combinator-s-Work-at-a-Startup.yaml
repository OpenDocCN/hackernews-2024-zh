    Typically, there is only one person working per project at the company. So, you're
    expected to make tough decisions on the go with little help from colleagues. Not
    only make decisions, but also make them fast and execute on it.

    top of the latest greatest, even if it means not all of us have clarity all the
    time. The problem statements at the company are often vague and open ended. You
    are expected to look for clarity, ask questions, do research and eventually come
    up with a solution. Fast.

    The team is an ultra tech aware one. So, we're always trying to use the super
    powers of the latest greatest technology out there. That means reading through
    a lot of shitty documentation and being many times the first to use a certain
    tech/library.

    I've written has been purged. Everyone at the company will have an outrageous
    amount of code that has been trashed. We build fast and trash faster. We experiment
    a lot. At any point of time there are atleast 3 projects that are in the research
    phase and might never make it to production. If you're on the project that didn't
    move the needle, it will be trashed. And there's no room to feel bad about it.
    It happens all the time.

    Not just that, if you feel there are parts of the development stack that are beneath

    Our customers have a long tail of requirements. Products that satisfy just the
    top 20% customers will not get us 80% of the revenue. We often have to go over
    and beyond to serve our customers. We don't settle easy. If you often think "I
    will skip this and will get away with it", you'd be in the wrong place.

    interact with the Reclaim Protocol, we use appclips. Appclips are a feature in
    phones that are oft overlooked. Making an app that opens instantaneously without
    having to install a new app by visiting the store unlocks a whole new design space.
    Ours is an appclip - which means there are strict limits on package size. So,
    we're not only optimizing the run time of the zkproofs, but we are also trying
    to optimize the package size at the same time.
