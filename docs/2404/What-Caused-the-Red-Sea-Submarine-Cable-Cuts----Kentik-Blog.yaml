    major submarine cables in the Red Sea were cut last month likely as a result of
    attacks by Houthi militants in Yemen on passing merchant vessels. In this post,
    we review the situation and delve into some of the observable impacts of the subsea
    cable cuts.

    EIG, and AAE-1) disrupting internet traffic for service providers from East Africa
    to Southeast Asia. For a variety of factors, the Red Sea has been a dangerous
    place for submarine cables over the years, but with a hostile party firing missiles
    at nearby seafaring vessels, it has recently become even more so.

    Sea and go into the internet impacts and timings of the submarine cable cuts.
    This work has been done in collaboration with WIRED magazine who is [simultaneously

    began firing missiles and armed drones at ships transiting the nearby [Bab al-Mandab

    affiliation with Israel, Britain, or the United States.

    YemenNet suffered a [multi-hour outage](https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1723016723459125292),

    calling for greater transparency within the submarine cable industry, because,
    according to cable owner GCX, the YemenNet outage was caused by scheduled maintenance.

    Days before the three subsea cable failures, a Belize-flagged, United Kingdom-owned
    cargo ship [was struck by missiles](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3680410/feb-18-summary-of-red-sea-activities/)
    fired from Yemen. The crew dropped anchor and abandoned the crippled ship, the
    MV Rubymar. Afterwards, the Rubymar began to drift, dragging its anchor — one
    of the top causes of submarine cable cuts according to the [International Cable
    Protection Committee](https://www.iscpc.org/). On March 2, the derelict vessel
    finally [sank](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-rubymar-sinks-red-sea-fb64a490ce935756337ee3606e15d093),

    to see an impact from its loss in Internet measurement data, but the losses of
    Seacom and AAE-1 were observable. In fact, due to the different geographies of
    these cables, I believe I have been able to infer the timings of each cable cut.
    There were two clear clusters of disruptions occurring at 09:46 UTC and again
    around 09:51 UTC — about five minutes apart.

    has been Tata’s preferred way to provides international transit to its customers
    in East Africa. Disruptions in East Africa, often involving the loss of Tata transit,
    occurred at 09:46 UTC. Therefore, I believe that is when Seacom suffered its failure.

    along the path of AAE-1 from the Red Sea to Asia, although we also saw impacts
    in East Africa. Therefore, I believe AAE-1 suffered its failure several minutes
    after the Seacom cut.
