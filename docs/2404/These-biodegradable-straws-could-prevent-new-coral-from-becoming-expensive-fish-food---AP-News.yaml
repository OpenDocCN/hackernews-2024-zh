- en: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — South Florida researchers trying to prevent predatory
    fish from devouring laboratory-grown coral are grasping at biodegradable straws
    in an effort to restore what some call the rainforest of the sea.

- en: Scientists around the world have been working for years to address the decline
    of coral reef populations. Just last summer, reef rescue groups in South Florida
    and the Florida Keys were trying to save coral from [rising ocean temperatures](https://apnews.com/article/coral-bleaching-rescue-florida-keys-ocean-heating-207cb6914deb0d588f29c3b27763b316).
    Besides working to keep existing coral alive, researchers have also been growing
    new coral in labs and then placing them in the ocean.

    marine species is not easy. Even more challenging is making sure that coral grown
    in a laboratory and placed into the ocean doesn’t become expensive fish food.

- en: Marine researcher Kyle Pisano said one problem is that predators like parrot
    fish attempt to bite and destroy the newly transplanted coral in areas like South
    Florida, leaving them with less than a 40% survival rate. With projects calling
    for thousands of coral to be planted over the next year and tens of thousands
    of coral to be planted over the next decade, the losses add up when coral pieces
    can cost more than $100 each.

    the small biodegradable cage that’s made in part with drinking straws boosts the
    survival rate of transplanted coral to over 90%.

- en: Fortunately the fish eventually lose interest in the coral as it matures, but
    scientists need to protect the coral in the meantime. Stainless steel and PVC
    pipe barriers have been set up around transplanted coral in the past, but those
    barriers needed to be cleaned of algae growth and eventually removed.

- en: Pisano had the idea of creating a protective barrier that would eventually dissolve,
    eliminating the need to maintain or remove it. He began conducting offshore experiments
    with biodegradable coral cages as part of a master’s degree program at Nova Southeastern
    University. He used a substance called polyhydroxyalkanoate, a biopolymer derived
    from the fermentation of canola oil. PHA biodegrades in ocean, leaving only water
    and carbon dioxide. His findings were published last year.

    brand drinking straws, made by Atlanta-based WinCup Inc. The device doesn’t have
    a top, Pisano said, because the juvenile coral needs sunlight and the parrot fish
    don’t generally want to position themselves facing downward to eat.

- en: Dotson, a retired aerospace engineer, met Pisano through his professor at Nova
    Southeastern, and the two formed Reef Fortify Inc. to further develop and market
    the patent-pending Coral Fort. The first batch of cages were priced at $12 each,
    but Pisano and Dotson believe that could change as production scales up.

- en: Early prototypes of the cage made from phade’s standard drinking straws were
    able to protect the coral for about two months before dissolving in the ocean,
    but that wasn’t quite long enough to outlast the interest of parrot fish. When
    Pisano and Dotson reached out to phade for help, the company assured them that
    it could make virtually any custom shape from its biodegradable PHA material.

- en: Boba straws are wider and thicker than normal drinking straws. They’re used
    for a tea-based drink that includes tapioca balls at the bottom of the cup. For
    Pisano and Dotson, that extra thickness means the straws last just long enough
    to protect the growing coral before harmlessly disappearing.

  zh: 珍珠奶茶吸管比普通饮用吸管更宽更厚。它们用于一种基于茶的饮料，杯底放有木薯球。对于皮萨诺和道森来说，这种额外的厚度意味着吸管能够在保护生长中的珊瑚之前恰好持续足够长的时间，然后无害地消失。

- en: Rich Karp, a coral researcher at the University of Miami, said they’ve been
    using the Coral Forts for about a month. He pointed out that doing any work underwater
    takes a great deal of time and effort, so having a protective cage that dissolves
    when it’s no longer needed basically cuts their work in half.

  zh: 迈阿密大学的珊瑚研究员里奇·卡普表示，他们已经使用珊瑚堡垒约一个月了。他指出，在水下进行任何工作都需要大量的时间和精力，因此当保护笼在不再需要时溶解，基本上可以把他们的工作量减少一半。

    amount of work, two times the amount of bottom time,” Karp said. “And it’s not
    really scalable.”
