    that looked to nature for improved efficiency. Switzerland's ABB Marine has also
    been inspired by "the dynamic motions of a whale's tail" for its multi-blade Dynafin
    propulsion concept.

    sixth largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. The International Maritime
    Organization has set a target of 50% reductions of global emissions by 2050, compared
    to levels in 2008, and now the race is on to find and use cleaner fuels and technologies
    to help meet these goals.

    consuming less energy," said ABB''s Janne Pohjalainen. "ABB has long been at the
    forefront of propulsion innovation, having undertaken a major step with the launch
    of the first generation Azipod system in the 1990s, which changed the way ship
    operate today... Now it''s time to take the next big leap with our latest innovation
    that is inspired by the movement perfected by evolution."'

- en: The Dynafin concept has been more than a decade in research and development,
    and is described as essentially a cycloidal propeller – where vertical blades
    are mounted to a spinning circular plate to provide thrust. It's not a new idea,
    the [Cyclogyro](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/cyclotech-cyclogyro-evtol-voith-schneider/)
    from and few years back took the setup to eVTOLs while [Voith Schneider props](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voith_Schneider_Propeller)
    have seen use by the US and French Navies.

    of a ship or boat, which spins at between 40 and 80 revolutions per minute as
    needed. The concept shows five independently controllable blades mounted below
    the disc, sitting equidistant along the circular edge – though the setup can run
    from four to six modules.

    to that of the tail of dolphin or whale. An onboard control system can rotate
    each blade around its own axis in real-time for simultaneous propulsion and steering
    of the vessel without needing to install a rudder.

    and superior maneuverability, and is aiming for an open-water efficiency of up
    to 85%. The modular concept can also be optimized for different operator needs,
    different ship types and hull types.

    improvement in efficiency that could lead to significant savings on fuel costs
    for combustion engine vessels, with fewer emissions as an added bonus. The system
    boasts a relatively low component count too, which should make for reduced maintenance
    costs.

    ABB noting that this could be of particular significance for vessels running electric,
    fuel-cell or hybrid systems where large battery banks can take up valuable cargo
    space.

    being housed within the host vessel's hull for reduced underwater noise, combined
    with the relatively "low-pressure pulses and blade-tip speeds" creating less turbulence.

    to existing ships and boats, or at what price to owners, though it could open
    up a world of new possibilities for designers of new builds.

    of development at the moment. ABB reports that successful simulations and scale-model
    testing have been undertaken, and contact made with ship designers "to validate
    the feasibility of the concept."

    from the bottom of the ship. Each blade can rotate both around the global axis
    of a main wheel and around its own local axis, which acts as a pivot point for
    enforcing a prescribed pitch motion. The thrusting blades’ trajectories resemble
    those of the tails of whales and dolphins."'

    and medium-sized passenger or work vessels, though larger vessels such as cruise
    ships could host multiple units – and plans already call for the technology to
    be incorporated in a new 450-ft superyacht called [Aeolis](https://www.oceancoyacht.com/designs/aeolus/)
