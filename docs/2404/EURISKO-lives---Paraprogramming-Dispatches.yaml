    there hardly was an expectation of a follow-up. The system was a dusty legend
    with some cynical minds arguing whether it existed in the first place.

- en: However, Lenat’s death in August last year has unlocked his [SAILDART archives](https://www.saildart.org/%5B*,DBL%5D/)
    account. This has led to a [thrilling discovery](https://white-flame.com/am-eurisko.html)
    of both AM and EURISKO sources by *WhiteFlame*. In a further development, *seveno4*
    has managed to [adapt EURISKO to run](https://github.com/seveno4/EURISKO) on Medley
    Interlisp.

    ever running EURISKO myself as a possibility. Truly an Indiana Jones finding the
    Lost Ark moment. Yet this very low probability event has indeed happened, as documented
    in the video below. Rewind to 8:20 for the Medley run.
