- en: 'Tor, one of the most important and misunderstood technologies of the digital
    age, is best known as the infrastructure underpinning the so-called Dark Web.
    But the real “dark web,” when it comes to Tor, is the hidden history brought to
    light in this book: where this complex and contested infrastructure came from,
    why it exists, and how it connects with global power in intricate and intimate
    ways. In *Tor: From the Dark Web to the Future of Privacy*,Ben Collier has written,
    in essence, a biography of Tor—a cultural and technological history of power,
    privacy, politics, and empire in the deepest reaches of the internet.'

- en: The story of Tor begins in the 1990s with its creation by the US Navy's Naval
    Research Lab, from a convergence of different cultural worlds. Drawing on in-depth
    interviews with designers, developers, activists, and users, along with twenty
    years of mailing lists, design documents, reporting, and legal papers, Collier
    traces Tor's evolution from those early days to its current operation on the frontlines
    of global digital power—including the strange collaboration between US military
    scientists and a group of freewheeling hackers called the Cypherpunks. As Collier
    charts the rise and fall of three different cultures in Tor's diverse community—the
    engineers, the maintainers, and the activists, each with a distinct understanding
    of and vision for Tor—he reckons with Tor's complicated, changing relationship
    with contemporary US empire. Ultimately, the book reveals how different groups
    of users have repurposed Tor and built new technologies and worlds of their own
    around it, with profound implications for the future of the Internet.
