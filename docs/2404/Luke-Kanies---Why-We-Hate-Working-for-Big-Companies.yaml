    in funding](https://lukekanies.com/writing/im-often-asked/) at a software company.
    This journey forced me to wrestle with existential questions about my true beliefs,
    and how they intersected my life as an entrepreneur. One’s work is rarely a pure
    reflection of ideology, but companies need a clear and authentic strategy, which
    requires a tight alignment between company operations and the founder’s philosophy.
    I have discovered more about those differences between what I believe and the
    best ways to grow a corporation while studying economics - that is, how money
    is made and exchanged - than any other area.

    of the twentieth century. The United States’ ideological battle was the central
    drama of my childhood, and it was with a combination of glee, pride, and “told

    dissolve shortly thereafter. I expect few would deny that the US is the standard
    bearer for capitalism.

    My parents did not earn money for their labor, and we didn’t have personal property.
    My family left the Farm when I was 8, and as I matured, my ideological roots were
    in conflict with the US’s nonstop pro-capitalism message. As I joined the workforce
    and eventually started [my own company](https://puppet.com/), I found myself attached
    to neither the communal roots of my childhood nor the Wolf of Wall Street world
    I moved into. I grew slowly in convictions, as I encountered problems in the course

    worse would be informed by a deep dip in economics. One of the core principles
    of the free market is that central planning committees can never be as efficient
    or as effective as the people doing the work. By definition a free market economy
    lacks a decision-making hierarchy; the ‘free’ means every agent (individual or
    corporation) can decide for themselves, without needing permission from a manager
    above.

    If you’re a farmer, you can decide what to grow, how much to grow, and when to
    work to develop your crop. Heck, you can even choose not to be a farmer any more.
    Success is merely dependent on your finding a buyer for your work at a price you

    schedules across the United Kingdom, or run a telegraph network around the whole

    a top-down plan to accomplish them, then drew information from the front line
    to see where it needed change. We called this a bottom-up plan, but it was only
    bottom-up from the perspective of numbers - how much money we’d have, what our
    costs were, etc. - rather than from the bottom of the organization. We could see
    no way to have a system where the people doing the work built a plan for the organization.

    exactly the amount of money it was worth, the corporations that employ them would
    have a much harder time making money. Instead, in modern corporations the shareholders
    and the executive team - again, the central planning committee we so despise -
    make the majority of the money, while the front line does all the work and makes
    very little. This is true even at the big tech firms; software developers might
    be well paid relative to hotel workers, but they’re paid a pittance compared to
    the founders and executives. This might speak to why we have no solution yet -
