  zh: 如何在非等级公司内处理经济问题可能会让一些人想到使用区块链代币作为内部货币。但这在今天是不可能的，超出了[区块链世界主要是关于欺诈和黑市销售](https://amzn.to/2Gv1yQz)这一事实之外。最大的问题是，[我们不知道如何评估大多数人所做的工作的价值](https://lukekanies.com/writing/where-does-your-work-live/)。我的意思是，我们可能知道开发人员应该得到多少年工作的报酬，但这项工作价值多少？现代公司中的大部分工作都极难评估，这也是公司如此低效并做出如此多错误决策的部分原因。
- en: That brings up an even bigger problem - companies today hire workers to make
    money from their labor. In other words, they generate profit because they pay
    their employees less than they’re worth. If everyone could trade their labor for
    exactly the amount of money it was worth, the corporations that employ them would
    have a much harder time making money. Instead, in modern corporations the shareholders
    and the executive team - again, the central planning committee we so despise -
    make the majority of the money, while the front line does all the work and makes
    very little. This is true even at the big tech firms; software developers might
    be well paid relative to hotel workers, but they’re paid a pittance compared to
    the founders and executives. This might speak to why we have no solution yet -
    free market corporations would tend to reduce concentrations of wealth, which
    would be terribly disruptive to the current system.

  zh: 这带来了一个更大的问题 - 如今的公司雇佣员工是为了从他们的劳动中获利。换句话说，他们通过支付员工低于其价值的报酬来获取利润。如果每个人都能以其劳动换取确切价值的金钱，雇佣他们的企业将更难盈利。相反，在现代公司中，股东和执行团队
    - 再次提到的中央规划委员会，我们如此鄙视 - 获得大部分的钱，而一线工人做了大部分工作，收入却微薄。即使在大型科技公司也是如此；软件开发人员相对于酒店工作人员可能薪酬较高，但与创始人和高管相比，他们的薪酬微不足道。这可能解释了为什么我们还没有解决方案
    - 自由市场公司倾向于减少财富的积聚，这对当前体制将是极其破坏性的。
- en: Like I said, I don’t have a solution. But at least now I know what makes the
    current system so painful, and it gives me some hope that we actually can come
    up with a better answer. I know I’ll be working harder in the future to manage
    the downsides of what we have today.
