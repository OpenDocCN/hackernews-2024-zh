    This article will explain why you should not use iPerf3 on Windows for synthetic
    network benchmarking and testing.  Followed by a brief explanation of why you
    should use ntttcp and ctsTraffic instead.

    calls.

    on Windows. You can read more about Cygwin in their [FAQ](https://www.cygwin.com/faq.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The iPerf3 calls are sent to Cygwin, which translates them to Windows APIs calls.
    Only then does the Windows network stack come into play. The iPerf3 on Windows
    maintainers do an excellent job of making it all work together, but, ultimately,
    there are potential issues with this approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not all the iPerf3 features will work on Windows. The basic options work well,
    but advanced capabilities needed for certain network testing may not be available
    on Windows or may behave in unexpected ways.
  prefs: []

- en: Emulation tends to have a performance penalty. The emulation overhead on a latency
    sensitive operation, such as network testing, can result in lower than expected
    throughput.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, iPerf3 uses uncommon Windows Socket (winsock) options versus native
    Windows applications. For generic throughput testing this is fine. For application
    testing the uncommon socket options will not mimic real-world Windows-native application
    behavior.

    that contains a bug which limits the socket buffer to 1MB. This will cause poor
    performance on high speed-high latency and high bandwidth networks because iPerf3
    will not be capable of putting enough data in-flight to saturate the link, resulting
    in inaccurate testing.

    a native Windows application does.'

    a separate codebase built for Linux that is compatible with ntttcp for Windows,
    but it is not identical to the Windows counterpart.

    Microsoft support customers. So, I am tuning ntttcp and ctsTraffic to better match
    iPerf3’s default single connection, 128KB buffer length behavior. While this is
    not a perfect comparison, this does make it a better comparison.

    not perform multi-threaded transfers. Bandwidth and maximum throughput testing
    should be multi-threaded with large buffers, but that is a topic for a different

    than iPerf3, but not quite as fast as ntttcp. The two primary reasons why ctsTraffic
    is slower are data integrity checks and the use of the recommended overlapped
    IO model. This means ctsTraffic uses a single pending receive versus pre-posting
    receives like ntttcp.
