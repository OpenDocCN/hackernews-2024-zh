- en: NAS vendor iXsystems has been busy this year, but apart from some statements
    in online user communities, it hasn't been talking about the big news. Back in
    2022, we [covered TrueNAS CORE 13](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/11/truenas_13_released/),
    the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS for NAS servers, and in that article
    we mentioned its new product, the Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing
    storage for Kubernetes users.

    meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD offering.

    for [Customers' Choice](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/truenas-enterprise-customers-choice-for-primary-storage-in-2024/)
    in storage. With some VMware users [feeling uncomfortable about Broadcom's takeover](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/broadcom_moves_to_reassure_vmware/)
    and assessing alternatives, many TrueNAS customers [told the company](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/new-survey-ranks-top-hypervisor-options-as-users-seek-vmware-alternatives/)
    that they were considering KVM.

    the pun, its *core* offering? It's called TrueNAS CORE 13 because it's based on
    [FreeBSD 13](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/announce/) … but that came
    out in April 2021, and earlier this month, the developers released the latest
    update, [FreeBSD 13.3](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.3R/announce/). TrueNAS
    CORE 13 users – including this vulture – are still waiting for the 13.1 release,
    which is still shown as an "Unstable Build" on the company's [Software Releases
    page](https://www.truenas.com/docs/truenasupgrades/), and with nary a hint on
    the [status page](https://www.truenas.com/software-status/).

    FreeNAS [first appeared](https://web.archive.org/web/20080313190212/http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2007-01.php)
    in 2005, based on the [m0n0wall firewall](https://m0n0.ch/wall/index.php) with
    a web GUI written in PHP. Under iXsystems, FreeNAS [got a whole new UI in version
    11](https://www.theregister.com/2017/06/15/freenas_11/), which is still used today.
    A fork of the original FreeNAS, updated with current FreeBSD components, continues
    as the [XigmaNAS project](https://xigmanas.com/xnaswp/).

- en: There is an upgrade path. Because of the way TrueNAS works, the OS is kept on
    its own, dedicated drive – the company recommends a fast SSD – that is not shared
    with the network, and indeed cannot be. Thanks to ZFS snapshots, it's possible
    to do an [in-place migration](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/migrate/migratingfromcore/),
    although it's a one-way process. Both the FreeBSD and Linux editions use the same
    OpenZFS file system so the new OS can pick up and migrate the settings from the
    old one. What it can't bring across is VM appliances. TrueNAS CORE [plugins](https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/jailspluginsvms/plugins/)
    run in FreeBSD Jails or under the [bhyve hypervisor](https://bhyve.org/), whereas
    the VMs you can create in [TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/apps/) run inside
    the Linux kernel's KVM. These are not interchangeable.

    BSD vendor, [Berkeley Software Design, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Design),
    which sold [BSD/386](http://gunkies.org/wiki/BSD/386), the first commercial BSD-based
    OS for commodity hardware. We described the early history of BSD when we [looked
    at FreeBSD 13.1](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/20/freebsd_131/). The company
    has a long and [complex history](https://www.ixsystems.com/history/) involving
    multiple mergers, sell-offs, and re-acquisitions, including Walnut Creek CD-ROM.

    its various names, the company has a long history of divestments, acquisitions,
    and, indeed, shutting products down. After merging with Walnut Creek, it [sold

    its OS division to Wind River, which then [sold off](https://www.macworld.com/article/152246/freebsd.html)
    the FreeBSD part of the business as the FreeBSD Mall, which [iXsystems acquired](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/ixsystems-announces-acquisition-of-freebsd-mall/)

    into [Open Media Vault](https://www.openmediavault.org/). iXsystems stepped up
    and [took over FreeNAS development](https://lwn.net/Articles/366886/). It also
    continued work on its desktop version, which in 2016 it renamed TrueOS. In 2020,
    it [discontinued TrueOS](https://www.truenas.com/trueos-discontinuation/), and
    [combined FreeNAS with its TrueNAS line](https://www.truenas.com/blog/freenas-truenas-unification/).

    *The Reg* FOSS desk remains skeptical about whether most of its users actually
    *need* Kubernetes, it remains popular and adoption continues to grow. Many companies
    have hitched their future to this bandwagon and got rich. For iXsystems, it seems
    to us like a small fish choosing to jump into a big pond, and we are concerned
    what might happen if the wave of microservices hype crests and dissipates.

    Like XigmaNAS, it installed onto a USB key, meaning that upgrading was as simple
    as writing a new image to a new key. In our briefings with the company, we've
    repeatedly reminded iXsystems of this, and requested the return of that feature,
    but the company's representatives didn't seem to understand why it was desirable.

    its cache must remain separate from the Linux kernel's own cache, which is a [key
    advantage for bcachefs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/linux_kernel_67/).
    We have no fewer than three old HP Microservers around, with a grand total of
    22 GB of RAM between them. That means TrueNAS SCALE is little use to us – and,
    we suspect, many other small deployments.
