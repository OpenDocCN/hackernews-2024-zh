    based on the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They argue that Meta's
    pay-or-consent model breaches data protection principles of the law, including
    the principles of purpose limitation, data minimization, fair processing, and
    transparency, with said processing enabling the company to "infer private details
    about the consumer." ®
