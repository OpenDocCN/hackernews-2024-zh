    the version number? We've all been there. Managing releases for open-source projects
    can feel like a tedious, error-prone process, especially when done with a mix
    of manual and automated steps. This article introduces an approach that turns
    your changelog into the ultimate source of truth for releases, making your project's
    releases fully automated

- en: 'Imagine a changelog that serves not just as a history, but also functions as
    a source of truth for releases. This is precisely the approach I adopted for [utt](https://github.com/larose/utt),
    an open source project I maintain. The changelog is kept in reverse chronological
    order, with the most recent version at the top. Here''s a glimpse:'

    marker. This allows grouping multiple changes before publishing them together.

    [utt's workflow](https://github.com/larose/utt/blob/e31c7340cd4c151b7a5bfa004b676ca72149978f/.github/workflows/publish.yml)),
    the concepts are adaptable to most programming languages and CI/CD tools.

- en: The core workflow involves a script that parses the changelog on push events
    to the master branch. If the latest entry is not `(unreleased)`, the script automatically
    updates the version number in relevant project files (e.g., pyproject.toml, version.txt).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, if the version is not `(unreleased)`, the script attempts to publish
    the new version to PyPI, if it's not already on PyPI. If the version already exists,
    the script skips the publish step to prevent attempting the same version again.
