    charging money for some of my plugins](/blog/money). Sadly, one year later I've
    reached a point where I'm just not willing to continue the way I did before.

- en: Ever since I first started to use Linux I was fascinated by the idea of open
    source. Almost everything I built on my own is open source, and I'm still contributing
    to upstream projects I'm using if I encounter things I can improve.

- en: I sponsored an open source project for the first time over ten years ago when
    I was still in university, because I always held the belief that if a project
    is valuable for me, it's worth supporting it. And if I don't have the time to
    contribute to it myself, I should at least support the people that do.

    but if they do, I'm happy to help. Working on an open source project is still
    work, and if you're doing a good job, you should be rewarded for it. I also always
    believed that if you ever started a project that is valuable for companies, they
    would support you in return, at least that's the reason why my own company is
    a monthly sponsor of [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) and why I sponsored maintainers
    of libraries I'm relying on.

- en: So, due to these naive believes, I started to work on nut.js under Apache-2.0
    license, because I thought that if companies and individuals alike are able to
    permissively use my software, they would also be willing to support me in return.
    Now, before you start judging me that I'm only in for the money, wouldn't you
    agree that it sounds awesome to work on an open source project full time, and
    still be able to pay your bills?

    into the core of nut.js, and that they were forced to use certain compatible versions
    of node or Electron. Then they started complaining that the image search plugin
    was not compatible with Apple Silicon. Which I made clear I would not be able
    to fix without a machine to test on. So if nobody is willing to lend me a machine
    or sponsor me, so I could get one myself, it's not going to happen.

    is, it certainly is not free. Someone is paying a price for it, and if it's not

    over decades, and now we're at a point where it's hard to turn back. Publishing
    source code for the greater good is a noble cause, but to be honest, I think that
    over the years, using "open source" has become an excuse to avoid paying for software.
