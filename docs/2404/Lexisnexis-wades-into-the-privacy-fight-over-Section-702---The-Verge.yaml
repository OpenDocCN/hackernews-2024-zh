- en: Congress has been trying to crack down on data brokers — and the data brokers
    are fighting back. In late March, the House [unanimously passed a bill](/2024/3/20/24106991/house-data-broker-foreign-adversaries-bill-passes)
    that would prevent Americans’ data from being sold to foreign adversaries. And
    an amendment on data collection is mixed up in the bill reauthorizing Section
    702of the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act](/2023/12/16/24004356/section-207-reauthorized-until-april-fisa-national-defence-cyber-surveillance)
    (FISA), the controversial statute that authorizes the National Security Agency,
    which expires later this month.

- en: Lawmakers’ negotiations over FISA’s reauthorization became so contentious that
    House Speaker Mike Johnson withdrew the bill from consideration in February. The
    biggest source of conflict was an amendment introduced by Rep. Warren Davidson
    (R-OH) that would prohibit data brokers from selling consumer data to law enforcement
    and would require a warrant to access Americans’ information, *Politico*’s *Influence*
    newsletter [reported in February](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/02/14/lawmakers-weigh-blacklist-for-firms-lobbying-for-chinese-military-linked-companies-00141525).
    National security hawks in Congress and local law enforcement groups joined forces
    to kill the amendment, with the National Sheriffs’ Association claiming it would
    “kneecap law enforcement” in a [letter](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=0000018d-a9ab-dda8-abff-b9bffc240000)
    to Congress.

    the letter read, “but on this one, we will keep score and know who our friends
    are by their votes against Congressman Davidson’s amendment, which empowers the
    cartels and further erodes the rule of law in our nation.”

- en: With FISA set to expire at the end of the month, Congress will no doubt take
    the issue up again. Some legislators have implied they’re unlikely to vote for
    the bill without the privacy amendments included. “We have to have these amendments.
    Like, there’s no way we’re not going to have them,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the
    chair of the House Judiciary Committee, [told *Politico*](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/14/congress/spy-powers-fight-is-back-johnson-jordan-00141435)

- en: Data brokers appear to be wading into the fight, too. Relx, the United Kingdom-based
    parent company of data analytics firm LexisNexis, hired the lobbying firm Venable
    earlier this year as the amendment was being debated in the House, [*Politico*’s
    *Influence* newsletter](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/04/04/lexisnexis-parent-company-lobbied-up-amid-fisa-fight-00150669)
    reported. Other Relx subsidiaries have recently come under fire for their data
    collection and distribution practices as well. In March, [*The* *New York Times*
    reported](/2024/3/22/24109057/gm-will-no-longer-sell-your-driving-data-to-third-party-companies)
    that several automakers were sharing information about their customers’ driving
    habits with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which, in turn, sold that information to
    insurance companies.
