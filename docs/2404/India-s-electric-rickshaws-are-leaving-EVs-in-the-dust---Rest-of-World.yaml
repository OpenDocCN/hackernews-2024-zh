    2017 as a helper — dusting, cleaning, and organizing items. A year later, he got
    the opportunity to upskill and get trained in welding by Chinese engineers. Nearly
    80% of Baran’s 200 co-workers have followed a similar trajectory. “[They] taught
    us all the work,” Baran told *Rest of World.* “They taught us welding — how to

    Sanjeev Pahwa’s cycle-rickshaw company and a traditional *tuk-tuk* manufacturer.
    The founders took advantage of the Indian government’s push for local manufacturing
    around the time, and set up two assembly units in Noida and Kolkata. They started
    manufacturing in Sonipat by 2016\. “I had the network, and, more importantly,
    I knew what cycle-rickshaw drivers need,” Kakkar said.

- en: A favorable policy environment has been crucial for the three-wheeler EV revolution
    in India, according to Lizbeth Jibi Godwin, research associate at the Center for
    Public Policy and Research (CPPR). “The subsidies and exemptions from obtaining
    permits for EVs have made electric three-wheelers an attractive option,” Godwin
    told *Rest of World*. “Additionally, the increasing demand for last-mile connectivity
    in public transport, such as buses and metro services, has led to a rise in electric

    minerals for the battery, have to come from China because they do not naturally
    occur in India, Sudip Banerjee, the company’s planning and strategy head, told

    like a cycle rickshaw. So whatever changes were done [to the vehicle], YC Electric
    did it first,” Kakkar said. For instance, he said, the company customized the
    vehicle’s tire size and improved its suspension to meet the requirements of Indian
    roads. “We got the first-mover advantage. And then we took another step — to collaborate

    instance, YC’s next champion product — a high-speed electric auto like the ones
