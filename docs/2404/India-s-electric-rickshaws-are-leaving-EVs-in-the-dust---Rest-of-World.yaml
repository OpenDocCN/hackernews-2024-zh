- en: At a small factory just north of Delhi, a welder named Ram Baran spends several
    hours each day training his coworkers in metal cutting, molding, and shaping bodies
    of three-wheeler electric vehicles.

- en: Baran is not an engineer by education. He started working at the factory in
    2017 as a helper — dusting, cleaning, and organizing items. A year later, he got
    the opportunity to upskill and get trained in welding by Chinese engineers. Nearly
    80% of Baran’s 200 co-workers have followed a similar trajectory. “[They] taught
    us all the work,” Baran told *Rest of World.* “They taught us welding — how to
    put the parts and cut them*.* Over time, I picked up the work and got promoted.
    Now, our people can also teach these things.”

    New Delhi — produces bodies and chassis for nearly 5,000 three-wheeler EVs, locally
    known as e-rickshaws, for the New Delhi-based YC Electric, India’s second-largest
    manufacturer in the segment. In 2023, YC Electric alone sold over 40,600 e-rickshaws,
    while [82,500electric cars](https://www.smev.in/statistics) were sold in the country.

    like Baran are powering an EV revolution in the country. In the last decade, around
    1.73 million three-wheeler EVs have [been sold](https://cleanmobilityshift.com/ev-dashboard/)
    in India. Just last month, around 500 manufacturers — most of them homegrown —
    sold over 44,000 e-rickshaws, compared to less than 6,800 electric cars sold during
    the month.

    popular brands like Tata, Ola, and Ather Energy, three of the top five brands
    in the e-rickshaw segment — YC Electric, Dilli Electric Auto, and Saera Electric
    — have little to no brand recall.

    director, Pawan Kakkar, told *Rest of World.* “They know it’s not their segment.

    Sanjeev Pahwa’s cycle-rickshaw company and a traditional *tuk-tuk* manufacturer.
    The founders took advantage of the Indian government’s push for local manufacturing
    around the time, and set up two assembly units in Noida and Kolkata. They started
    manufacturing in Sonipat by 2016\. “I had the network, and, more importantly,
    I knew what cycle-rickshaw drivers need,” Kakkar said.

    in India, according to Lizbeth Jibi Godwin, research associate at the Center for
    Public Policy and Research (CPPR). “The subsidies and exemptions from obtaining
    permits for EVs have made electric three-wheelers an attractive option,” Godwin
    told *Rest of World*. “Additionally, the increasing demand for last-mile connectivity
    in public transport, such as buses and metro services, has led to a rise in electric
    three-wheelers.”

    company’s former Chinese import partners Jiang Li and Xue Jian Nan, who hold a
    49% stake in the facility. *“*The link [with the Chinese suppliers] became so
    good that they also believed in us, invested money with us, and shared technology
    with us*,*” Kakkar said. Chinese engineers stayed “for days” to train welders
    like Baran when the factory first opened, he said.

    vehicles locally, but some parts, like the natural magnet for the motor and critical
    minerals for the battery, have to come from China because they do not naturally
    occur in India, Sudip Banerjee, the company’s planning and strategy head, told
    *Rest of World*.He said that things could slowly change as [more lithium reserves](https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/economy/story/jharkhand-emerges-as-the-latest-hub-of-lithium-reserves-in-india-400491-2023-10-03)

    like a cycle rickshaw. So whatever changes were done [to the vehicle], YC Electric
    did it first,” Kakkar said. For instance, he said, the company customized the
    vehicle’s tire size and improved its suspension to meet the requirements of Indian
    roads. “We got the first-mover advantage. And then we took another step — to collaborate
    with the Chinese.”

    instance, YC’s next champion product — a high-speed electric auto like the ones
    its larger rival Mahindra makes — is stuck after border conflicts soured relations
    between the two neighbors. The development of the new vehicle — which *Rest of
    World* snuck a peek at while it was being tested at the Sonipat factory — has
    been stunted because “people are not able to come from [China]. Business visas
    are also not being given,” Kakkar said. India has reportedly put a [strict visa
    approval process](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/visa-delays-for-chinese-professionals-hit-india-businesses/articleshow/100834085.cms?from=mdr)

    in steel manufacturing, have organized training sessions for workers at the plant,
