    that magic is more popular than ever. We enjoy performances where skilled magicians
    make lemons or elephants appear and disappear before our eyes. Not many academic
    philosophers discuss magic, however, five centuries ago, prominent Renaissance
    philosophers, such as Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499), Giovanni Pico della Mirandola
    (1463–1494), and Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), wrote extensive treatises on the
    topic. They conceived of magic as the ability to work wonders, and as such it
    merited close philosophical attention.

    technology that harnesses our sense of wonder. Magic connects to wonder in two
    ways. First, it is the ability to do wondrous things, and hence a kind of power.
    The word “magic” derives ultimately from the Proto-Indo European word for “power.”
    Second, magic is passive: it denotes our amazement at wonders we don’t fully understand.
    The word *thaumaturgy* ultimately derives from the Greek root *thaumazein, *which
    means to wonder. Magic relies on both these aspects: active power and passive
    wonder.'

    widespread and was already mentioned in a letter by Seneca. A ball seemingly vanishes
    from the magician’s closed fist to reappear under a cup. This is repeated until
    eventually, the magician makes a lemon or some other object appear (in lieu of
    a ball) under one of the cups. This trick relies on object permanence, our ability
    to track occluded objects. The magician uses misdirection (demonstrating the cup
    is empty) to maneuver the ball under it. We are also beguiled because we attribute
    intentionality to hand gestures. The sleight of hand used is the French drop,
    where an object is seemingly transferred while remaining in its original position.
    At a neural level, there is a clear difference between surprise and wonder: a
    surprise action, such as a hand swiping a coin away, elicits a different response
    from a magical action, where a coin disappears into thin air. Adam Smith already
    theorized about this difference between surprise and wonder in his *History of
    Astronomy *(1795): we *expect *the ball to disappear and reappear in the cups
    and balls magic trick; we are not surprised, but we “will still wonder, though
    forewarned of what we are to see.”'

    magic, magical performances are a more encompassing art that strive to create
    beauty and a compelling narrative. As stage magician and philosopher Larry Hass
    explains, witnessing magic can be empowering because as the audience you get to
    share in the idea that we can achieve the impossible. Stage magician Teller describes
    magic as a kind of playful epistemology, “the heaviest philosophical ideas you
    can possibly have, dealt with in the silliest way.”

    philosophers have speculated that magical practices lie at the origin of science.
    Consider a philosopher such as Giordano Bruno. According to Frances Yates’s classic
    monograph *Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition* (1964), he was not burned
    at the stake for his acceptance of heliocentrism but because he dabbled in hermetic
    magic. For Bruno, there was no clear dividing line between early science and magic.
    Consider his definition of natural magic from his *On magic *(1584)*: *

    between things, for example, the pushes, motions and attractions due to magnets
    and such things, when all these actions are due not to active and passive qualities
    but rather to the spirit or soul existing in things. This is called “natural magic”
    in the proper sense.

    natural materials and observe the effects of their manipulations. Like many other
    Renaissance magicians, Bruno saw magic as entirely natural: phenomena such as
    magnetism and electricity were bizarre but not of supernatural origin. By contrast,
    natural philosophers tried to airbrush strange phenomena away. The origin of science,
    accordingly, lies in recognizing that strange phenomena are natural and that we
    can gain control over them.'

    to science. Otto Neurath (1882–1945) is now best known as one of the co-founders
    of the Vienna Circle (*Wiener Kreis*) in 1924, and of the associated philosophical
    movement known as logical positivism. His philosophy of science is intimately
    related to his cosmopolitan, progressive political ideas. Neurath wanted to present
    an ideological alternative to the fascism which was growing in his home country
    Austria in the 1920s. To stop the far right, he argued that we should aim for
    clarity of thought, practicality, and improving the lives of people who were hard-hit
    by the financial crisis of the 1920s. In their 1929 Vienna Circle manifesto, he,
    together with Hans Hahn and Rudolph Carnap insisted that “the scientific world-conception
    knows no *unsolvable riddle*.” Their vision of science was connected to their
    concern with collective human life, including improving the lives of the working
    class, public education, and social reform. They presented magic as the intellectual
    ancestor of science: we should be “returning, after a metaphysical interlude,
    to a unified picture of this world which had, in a sense, been at the basis of
    magical beliefs, free from theology, in the earliest times.”'

    practical thinking that motivates modern science. Science is not elitist, but
    the opposite: it is a range of practices that people use to help improve their
    lives. He saw working-class people as resembling Indigenous people, striving to
    solve concrete problems that their natural and social environments pose. As he
    explains in *Empirical sociology *(1931) magicians, like scientists, try to find
    causal connections in opaque phenomena:'

    to primeval systematic orderliness as found in magic. The scientific tendency
    to link everything with everything else, to regard nothing as indifferent, clearly
    already belonged to the age of magic.

    climate of fascism and eventually the murder of one of its members (Moritz Schlick).
    But Neurath points out an important aspect of magic: magic shows our ambition
    to deal with the wondrous and not shy away from it, to find connections in a causally
    opaque universe, and to come up with practical solutions based on those connections.'

    with wonders we can’t explain, but we try our best to figure them out. When you
    watch a magic show, you can’t but help wonder at the secrets behind each sleight
    of hand, and a big subgenre of magical performance consists of revealing how classic
    tricks are accomplished. Wonder is thus not the endpoint of knowledge, but a starting
    point. As Adam Smith puts it, “Who wonders at the machinery of the opera-house
    who has once been admitted behind the scenes? In the wonders of nature, however,
    it rarely happens that we can discover so clearly this connecting chain.” Thus,
    wonder prompts us to continue to look for hidden connections and to try to untangle
    how things are done.'
