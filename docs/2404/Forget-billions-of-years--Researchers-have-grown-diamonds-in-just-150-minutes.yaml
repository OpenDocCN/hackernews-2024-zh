- en: Did you know that 99% of synthetic diamonds are currently produced using high-pressure
    and high-temperature (HPHT) methods?[2] A prevailing paradigm is that diamonds
    can only be grown using liquid metal catalysts in the gigapascal pressure range
    (typically 5-6 GPa, where 1 GPa is about 10,000 atm), and typically within the
    temperature range of 1300-1600 °C. However, the diamonds produced using HPHT are
    always limited to sizes of approximately one cubic centimeter due to the components
    involved. That is—achieving such high pressures can only be done at a relatively
    small length scale. Discovering alternative methods to make diamonds in liquid
    metal under milder conditions (particularly at lower pressure) is an intriguing
    basic science challenge that if achieved could revolutionize diamond manufacturing.
    Could the prevailing paradigm be challenged?

  zh: 你知道吗？目前99%的合成钻石是通过高压高温（HPHT）方法生产的？[2] 一个普遍的范式是，钻石只能在吉卜斯压力范围内（通常为5-6 GPa，1 GPa约为10,000大气压），通常在1300-1600°C的温度范围内，使用液态金属催化剂生长。然而，使用HPHT方法生产的钻石由于涉及的组分问题，其尺寸始终限于大约一个立方厘米。也就是说，只能在相对较小的尺度上实现如此高的压力。在较温和条件下（尤其是在较低压力下）发现制造液态金属中的钻石的替代方法，是一个引人入胜的基础科学挑战，如果实现，可能会彻底改变钻石制造业。是否可以挑战现有的范式？

    Carbon Materials (CMCM) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), including
    graduate students at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST),
    have grown diamonds under conditions of 1 atmosphere pressure and at 1025 °C using
    a liquid metal alloy composed of gallium, iron, nickel, and silicon, thus breaking
    the existing paradigm. The discovery of this new growth method opens many possibilities
    for further basic science studies and for scaling up the growth of diamonds in

    breakthrough was the result of human ingenuity, unremitting efforts, and the concerted
    cooperation of many collaborators.” Researchers led by Ruoff conducted a series

- en: Ruoff notes “We had been running our parametric studies in a large chamber (named
    RSR-A with an interior volume of 100 liters) and our search for parameters that
    would yield growth of diamond was slowed due to the time needed to pump out air
    (about 3 minutes), purge with inert gas (90 minutes), followed by pumping down
    again to vacuum level (3 minutes) so that the chamber could then be filled with
    1 atmosphere pressure of quite pure hydrogen/methane mixture (again 90 minutes);
    that is over 3 hours before the experiment could be started! I asked Dr. Won Kyung
    SEONG to design & build a much smaller chamber to greatly reduce the time needed
    to start (and finish!) the experiment with the liquid metal exposed to the mixture
    of methane and hydrogen.” Seong adds, “Our new homebuilt system (named RSR-S,
    with an interior volume of only 9 liters) can be pumped out, purged, pumped out,
    and filled with methane/hydrogen mixture, in a total time of 15 minutes. Parametric
    studies were greatly accelerated, and this helped us discover the parameters for
    which diamond grows in the liquid metal!”

    李补充道：“我们的新自制系统（名为RSR-S，内部容积仅为9升）在总共15分钟内可以抽空、置换、抽空，并填充甲烷/氢气混合物。参数研究大大加速，这有助于我们发现液态金属中生长金刚石的参数！”

- en: Ruoff elaborates, “The presence of such a high concentration of carbon ‘dissolved’
    in a gallium-rich alloy could be unexpected, as carbon is reported to be not soluble
    in gallium. This may explain why this region is amorphous—while all other regions
    of the solidified liquid metal are crystalline. This sub-surface region is where
    our diamonds nucleate and grow and we thus focused on it.”

- en: Researchers exposed the Ga-Fe-Ni-Si liquid metal to the methane/hydrogen for
    short periods of time to try to understand the early growth stage—well prior to
    the formation of a continuous diamond film. They then analyzed the concentrations
    of carbon in the subsurface regions using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
    depth profiling. After a 10-minute run, no diamond particles were evident but
    there were ~65 at% carbon atoms present in the region where the diamond typically
    grows. Diamond particles began to be found after a 15-minute run, and there was
    a lower subsurface C atom concentration of ~27 at%.

    10 分钟的运行，未见金刚石颗粒，但亚表面区域存在约 65% 的碳原子。金刚石颗粒开始在 15 分钟后被发现，亚表面 C 原子浓度下降至约 27%。
- en: Ruoff explains, “The concentration of subsurface carbon atoms is so high at
    around 10 minutes that this time exposure is close to or at supersaturation, leading
    to the nucleation of diamonds either at 10 minutes or sometime between 10 and
    15 minutes. The growth of diamond particles is expected to occur very rapidly
    after nucleation, at some time between about 10 minutes and 15 minutes.”

    10 分钟到 15 分钟之间。”

    an attachment to the growth chamber having an array of nine thermocouples that
    was designed and built by Seong. The central region of the liquid metal was found
    to be at a lower temperature compared to the corners and sides of the chamber.
    It is thought that this temperature gradient is what drives carbon diffusion towards
    the central region, facilitating diamond growth.

- en: The team also discovered that silicon plays a critical role in this new growth
    of diamond. The size of the grown diamonds becomes smaller and their density higher
    as the concentration of silicon in the alloy was increased from the optimal value.
    Diamonds could not be grown at all without the addition of silicon, which suggests

  zh: 研究团队还发现，在这种新型金刚石的生长中，硅起着关键作用。当合金中硅的浓度从最佳值增加时，生长的金刚石尺寸变小，密度更高。没有硅的添加，金刚石根本无法生长，这表明硅可能参与了金刚石的初期成核过程。
- en: This was supported by the various theoretical calculations conducted to uncover
    the factors that may be responsible for the growth of diamonds in this new liquid
    metal environment. Researchers found that silicon promotes the formation and stabilization
    of certain carbon clusters by predominantly forming sp3 bonds like carbon. It
    is thought that small carbon clusters containing Si atoms might serve as the ‘pre-nuclei’,
    which can then grow further to nucleate a diamond. It is predicted that the likely
    size range for an initial nucleus is around 20 to 50 C atoms.

    metal is fascinating and offers many exciting opportunities for more basic science.
    We are now exploring when nucleation, and thus the rapid subsequent growth of
    diamond, happens. Also ‘temperature drop’ experiments where we first achieve supersaturation

- en: Ruoff concludes, “Diamond might be grown in a wide variety of relatively low
    melting point liquid metal alloys such as containing one or more of indium, tin,
    lead, bismuth, gallium, and potentially antimony and tellurium—and including in
    the molten alloy other elements such as manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt and so
    on as catalysts, and others as dopants that yield color centers. And there is
    a wide range of carbon precursors available besides methane (various gases, and
    also solid carbons). New designs and methods for introducing carbon atoms and/or
    small carbon clusters into liquid metals for diamond growth will surely be important,
    and the creativity and technical ingenuity of the worldwide research community
    seem likely to me, based on our discovery, to rapidly lead to other related approaches
    and experimental configurations. There are numerous intriguing avenues to explore!”
