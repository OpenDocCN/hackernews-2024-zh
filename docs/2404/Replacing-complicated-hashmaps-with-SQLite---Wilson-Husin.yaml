- en: In a recent project, I was working on a command line application with tricky
    data manipulation scenario. Imagine if you were moving members from mailing lists
    (e.g. Google Groups) to group chat service (e.g. Slack), where the goal is for
    members of the mailing list will find a new home in group chat channels.

    out and run it for each of the groups” and I agree — surely it’s a thing that
    a few HTTP calls and hashmaps can solve?

    service can lookup users by email, but need the user ID for API calls to link

    2 lookup keys (hashmaps) for the same value kind.

    a single SQL query.”'

    debugging. Of course I would have to change the setup from `:memory:` to a file
    path that exists in file system.

    worked out better for the rest of the project to access database connection from
