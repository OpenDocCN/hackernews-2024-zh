    island of significant size, Kauai is home to around 70,000 residents and 30,000
    tourists at any given time. Renewable energy accounts for 70 percent of the energy
    produced in a typical year—a proportion that’s among the highest in the world
    and that can be hard to sustain for such a small and isolated grid. During the
    day, the local system operator, the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, sometimes
    reaches levels of 90 percent from solar alone. But on 2 April, the 26-MW generator
    was running near its peak output, to compensate for the drop in solar output as
    the sun set. At the moment when it failed, that single generator had been supplying
    60 percent of the load for the entire island, with the rest being met by a mix
    of smaller generators and several utility-scale solar-and-battery systems.

    of the generators feeding the grid. Fortunately, the kinetic energy stored in

    produces a high-frequency AC signal that is filtered by capacitors and other components

    is determined by the physical and electrical characteristics of the generator.

    Both can inject current into the grid during a disturbance. Also, both types of
    inverters can support the voltage on a grid by controlling their reactive power,
    which is the product of the voltage and the current that are *out of* phase with
    each other. Both kinds of inverters can also help prop up the frequency on the

    mainly software. GFM inverters are controlled by code designed to maintain a stable
    output voltage waveform, but they also allow the magnitude and phase of that waveform
    to change over time. What does that mean in practice? The unifying characteristic
    of all GFM inverters is that they hold a constant voltage magnitude and frequency
    on short timescales—for example, a few dozen milliseconds—while allowing that
    waveform’s magnitude and frequency to change over several seconds to synchronize
    with other nearby sources, such as traditional generators and other GFM inverters.

    achieve this response by mimicking the physical and electrical characteristics
    of a synchronous generator, using control equations that describe how it operates.
    Other GFM inverters are programmed to simply hold a constant target voltage and
    frequency, allowing that target voltage and frequency to change slowly over time
    to synchronize with the rest of the power grid following what is called a [droop
    curve](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8662197). A droop curve is a formula
    used by grid operators to indicate how a generator should respond to a deviation
    from nominal voltage or frequency on its grid. There are many variations of these

    ground or a generator trips due to a lightning strike. (Such problems typically
    occur multiple times a week, even on the best-run grids.) The key advantage of
    a GFM inverter in such a situation is that it does not need to quickly sense frequency
    and voltage decline on the grid to respond. Instead, a GFM inverter just holds
    its own voltage and frequency relatively constant by injecting whatever current
    is needed to achieve that, subject to its physical limits. In other words, a GFM
    inverter is programmed to act like an AC voltage source behind some small impedance
    (impedance is the opposition to AC current arising from resistance, capacitance,
    and inductance). In response to an abrupt drop in grid voltage, its digital controller
    increases current output by allowing more current to pass through its power transistors,
    without even needing to measure the change it’s responding to. In response to
    falling grid frequency, the controller increases power.

- en: GFL controls, on the other hand, need to first measure the change in voltage
    or frequency, and then take an appropriate control action before adjusting their
    output current to mitigate the change. This GFL strategy works if the response
    does not need to be superfast (as in microseconds). But as the grid becomes weaker
    (meaning there are fewer voltage sources nearby), GFL controls tend to become
    unstable. That’s because by the time they measure the voltage and adjust their
    output, the voltage has already changed significantly, and fast injection of current
    at that point can potentially lead to a dangerous positive feedback loop. Adding
    more GFL inverters also tends to reduce stability because it becomes more difficult
    for the remaining voltage sources to stabilize them all.

- en: Increasing the maximum current flow is possible, but it requires increasing
    the capacity of the power transistors and other components, which can significantly
    increase cost. So most inverters (both GFM and GFL) don’t provide current surges
    larger than about 10 to 30 percent above their rated steady-state current. For
    comparison, a synchronous generator can inject around 500 to 700 percent more
    than its rated current for several AC line cycles (around a tenth of a second,
    say) without sustaining any damage. For a large generator, this can amount to
    thousands of amperes. Because of this difference between inverters and synchronous
    generators, the protection technologies used in power grids will need to be adjusted
    to account for lower levels of fault current.

    include creating standard GFM specifications so that inverter vendors can create
    products. We also need accurate models that can be used to simulate the performance
    of GFM inverters, so we can understand their impact on the grid.

    for example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) recently
    published a recommendation that *all* future large-scale battery-storage systems
    have grid-forming capability.

    some countries, including Australia, Finland, and Great Britain. In the United
    States, the Department of Energy recently backed a consortium to tackle building
    and integrating inverter-based resources into power grids. Led by the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Texas at Austin, and the Electric
    Power Research Institute, the Universal Interoperability for Grid-Forming Inverters
    [(UNIFI) Consortium](https://unificonsortium.org/) aims to address the fundamental
    challenges in integrating very high levels of inverter-based resources with synchronous
    generators in power grids. The [consortium](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/unifi-consortium)
    now has over 30 members from industry, academia, and research laboratories.

    at 150 megawatts and 194 megawatt-hours. Hornsdale, along with another facility
    called the Riverina Battery, are the country’s two largest grid-forming installations.

    their performance in large-scale systems. Without such verification, grid operators
    won’t trust the performance of new GFM technologies. Using GFM models built by
    the UNIFI Consortium, system operators and utilities such as the Western Electricity
    Coordinating Council, American Electric Power, and ERCOT (the Texas’s grid-reliability
    organization) are conducting studies to understand how GFM technology can help
    their grids.

    a question naturally arises: Will *all* inverters need to be grid-forming? No.
    Several studies and simulations have indicated that we’ll need just enough GFM
    inverters to strengthen each area of the grid so that nearby GFL inverters remain
    stable.'

- en: How many GFMs is that? The answer depends on the characteristics of the grid
    and other generators. Some initial studies have shown that a power system can
    operate with 100 percent inverter-based resources if around 30 percent are grid-forming.
    More research is needed to understand how that number depends on details such
    as the grid topology and the control details of both the GFLs and the GFMs.

- en: Ultimately, though, electricity generation that is completely carbon free in
    its operation is within our grasp. Our challenge now is to make the leap from
    small to large to very large systems. We know what we have to do, and it will
    not require technologies that are far more advanced than what we already have.
    It will take testing, validation in real-world scenarios, and standardization
    so that synchronous generators and inverters can unify their operations to create
    a reliable and robust power grid. Manufacturers, utilities, and regulators will
    have to work together to make this happen rapidly and smoothly. Only then can
    we begin the next stage of the grid’s evolution, to large-scale systems that are
    truly carbon neutral.
