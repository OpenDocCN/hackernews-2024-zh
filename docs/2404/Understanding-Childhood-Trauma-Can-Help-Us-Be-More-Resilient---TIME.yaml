- en: In 2022, the World Health Organization estimated that [1 billion children](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-children)
    were maltreated each year around the globe. Maltreatment such as neglect and abuse
    are types of adverse childhood experiences, or [ACEs](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/adverse-childhood-experiences-international-questionnaire-(ace-iq)).
    But they often say little about how children respond, which can either be traumatic
    or resilient. Now, revolutionary new findings in the sciences help us understand
    how different dimensions of adversity can leave different signatures of trauma
    and how we can use this knowledge to help children recover and build resilience
    against future harms.

    two children that I worked with as an educator and researcher of trauma in schools.
    Ethan was abandoned by his mother at birth and placed in an orphanage in Eastern
    Europe, his home for the next six years. He was deprived of the fundamental needs
    of safety, nutrition, and human contact. He had books, but there was no one to
    read to him. He had caretakers, but they rarely comforted him when he was upset.

- en: Kevin, on the other hand, witnessed his father physically and emotionally abusing
    his mother for the first ten years of his life. Around his sixth birthday, Kevin
    directly experienced his father's abuse. For entertainment, and to teach him that
    life is tough, Dad put Kevin and his older sister Joani into the outdoor dog cage,
    threw food in, and forced them to compete for their nightly dinner. If they refused,
    he beat them until they entered the dinner arena.

- en: Ethan and Kevin were both traumatized by their maltreatment, but that doesn't
    capture what was happening inside of them. Ethan had no motivation, was numb to
    rewards, struggled with school and couldn't maintain social relationships. Kevin
    was an emotional maelstrom, frightened, hypervigilant, running away from unfamiliar
    men and hurting himself when he heard noises. Ethan and Kevin presented different
    traumatic responses or “signatures”—unique identifiers of the mental distortions
    created by their adverse experiences. Identifying these traumatic signatures enables
    caretakers, teachers, doctors, and counselors to sculpt a path to resilience that
    is specific to the child's harms and needs and gives them the best hope for recovery,
    whether in childhood or later in life.

    but the scientific evidence leading to it is not. We have known for decades that
    different environmental experiences [shape](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35285791/)
    development, including how and when our emotions, thoughts, and actions mature.
    When the environment is harsh and unpredictable, threatening survival, the timing
    of development tends to speed up, leading to individuals who mature quickly—recognizing
    and responding appropriately to danger as youngsters. In contrast, when the environment
    is impoverished, with individuals deprived of essential experiences and resources,
    development tends to slow down, [resulting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35256038/)
    in delays in the attainment of independence, dedicated social roles, and sexual
    behavior.

    [types of ACEs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9635069/;%20https:/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34491864/)
    — deprivation and abuse, respectively — during different [time periods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32101708/)

    functions](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/what-is-executive-function-and-how-does-it-relate-to-child-development/#:~:text=The%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Cexecutive%20function%E2%80%9D%20refers,focused%20despite%20distractions%2C%20among%20others.)—attention,
    short-term working memory, self-regulation, and planning. The executive functions
    form the bedrock to all learning and decision-making, but they are also essential
    in supporting more specialized cognitive functions such as language, social thinking,
    math, music, and morality. Children with weak executive functions [fare poorly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11899554/;%20https:/www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0005)

    threats, accompanied by hypervigilance, emotional turbulence, and out of control
    behavior. The root cause is a hyperactive amygdala, a brain region that plays
    an essential role in emotional processing, and its connection to a frontal lobe
    region that controls our feelings, thoughts, and actions. This constellation of
    changes to the nervous system leaves the child in a heightened state of fear,
    either fleeing or fighting to cope with an [unsafe world](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact).
    Such was Kevin's traumatic response.

    timing. In [studies](https://www.bucharestearlyinterventionproject.org/) of orphans
    living in austere, institutionalized settings — such as the orphanage that Ethan
    grew up in—those deprived of essential experiences for more than the first few
    years of life showed deficits in executive functioning, social relationships,
    and attachment. In contrast, orphans who were placed in foster care by their second
    birthday, largely recovered from their deprivation in the years that followed.
    Children who are abused [earlier in life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271092/;%20https:/www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2016.111),
    typically before puberty—such as Kevin—show greater emotional dysregulation, weaker
    control over their thoughts and actions, and more rapid biological aging.

    signatures. But ultimately, they also define how we help children recover and
    sculpt their resilience. Each child's genetic architecture positions them somewhere
    on a spectrum of responses to adversity that runs from vulnerable to [resilient](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-081219-120307).
    Those who land on the resilient end are handed greater immunity to adversity because

    Environmental experiences can displace individuals onto different sections of
    this spectrum, either enhancing their resilience or magnifying their vulnerability.

    care started with Julie, his adoring adoptive mother. At age 10, Kevin''s father
    was incarcerated and his parents divorced, thereby ending his tenure of exposure
    to abuse and starting a more promising life with his mother Kate who desperately
    tried to provide for him despite her own struggles with mental health. Ethan and
    Kevin were both on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) that documented their
    disabilities and guided the work carried out in their schools. Both of their schools
    were trauma-informed, meaning that they adhered to the [4Rs](https://www.nctsn.org/resources/creating-supporting-and-sustaining-trauma-informed-schools-system-framework):
    **r**ealizing that traumatic experiences are common, **r**ecognizing that traumatic
    experiences are associated with specific symptoms or signatures, **r**esponding
    to a child''s trauma by integrating knowledge of what happened with what can be
    done to help, and **r**esisting re-traumatizing both students and staff. Both
    schools were also aware of Ethan''s and Kevin''s life experiences and recognized
    that they would require different approaches for aiding recovery and building
    resilience.'

    the early years of their lives, required an approach that reassured him of receiving
    unwavering, predictable care while providing strategies to enhance his ability
    to learn and develop healthy relationships. His care included access to a visual
    schedule that showed the timing of activities, including when meals and snacks
    were provided. Predictable access to meals and snacks, both at home and in school,
    rapidly helped reduce his obsession and hoarding of food. The unwavering support
    provided by Julie as well as the school staff, eventually melted away Ethan's
    distrust of others, enabling healthy relationships to grow. The visual schedule
    helped reduce the load on his short- term working memory, while helping him prepare
    and plan for transitions between activities. Stubbornly resistant to change, however,
    was Ethan’s capacity to associate or link actions with consequences. For Ethan,
    as for other children who have been severely deprived of experiences early in
    life, associative learning was heavily compromised, awaiting the addition of new
    tools to the trauma-informed toolkit.

    medication for aggression, impulsivity, and hyperactivity—along with cognitive
    behavioral therapy to help him find alternative ways of thinking about and coping
    with his trauma. His teachers intervened further, providing him with frequent
    breaks to manage his frustration and burn off some energy. These approaches reduced
    Kevin’s outbursts and violent attacks on peers and staff, but he was still highly
    impulsive and fidgety. Kevin’s team decided to start him on [neurofeedback](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32658503/),
    a method that enabled him to consciously modify the pattern of brain activation,
    shifting toward greater calm, focus, and control over his emotions. Eventually,
    Kevin developed good friends, healthy relationships with teachers, and an after-school
    job where he was learning to be a car mechanic. He also learned to trust other
    men, including me, one of his teachers, who deeply cared about him and cheered
    on his successes.

    equipped with skills to manage future adversity. Both lucked out with relatively
    resilient genetic architectures that were joined by nurturing environments, ones
    filled with people who cared for them. Many other children, perhaps the majority
    of the 1 billion who are maltreated each year, are less fortunate, more vulnerable
    by nature and nurture. While it is highly unlikely that we will ever flatten the
    landscape of harm, we can do far more to nurture recovery and build resilience
    if we recognize how traumatic signatures unfold—and how to create action plans
    to work through them.
