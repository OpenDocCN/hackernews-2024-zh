    gems, they exist in myriad bright colors: shiny blue, red, orange, leaf green
    and transparent flecked with gold. They’re members of a group of 40,000 species
    of leaf beetles, the Chrysomelidae, one of the most species-rich branches of the
    vast beetle order, Coleoptera. “You have your weevils, longhorns, and leaf beetles,”
    she says. “That’s really the trio that dominates beetle diversity.”'

    has long wondered why the kingdom of life is so skewed toward beetles: The tough-bodied
    creatures make up about a quarter of all animal species. Many biologists have
    wondered the same thing, for a long time. “Darwin was a beetle collector,” Chaboo
    notes.'

    And that’s just the beetles described so far. Scientists typically describe thousands
    of new species each year. So — why so many beetle species? “We don’t know the
    precise answer,” says Chaboo. But clues are emerging.

    long. “Beetles are 350 million years old,” says evolutionary biologist and entomologist
    [Duane McKenna](https://www.duanemckenna.com/) of the University of Memphis in
    Tennessee. That’s a great deal of time in which existing species can speciate,
    or split into new, distinct genetic lineages. By way of comparison, modern humans
    have existed for only about 300,000 years.

    have more species. Some very old groups have [very few species](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2018/master-teller-fish-stories).
    Coelacanth fish, for example, have been swimming the ocean for approximately 360
    million years, reaching a maximum of around 90 species and then declining to the
    two species known to be living today. Similarly, the lizard-like reptile the tuatara
    is the only living member of a once globally diverse ancient order of reptiles
    that originated about 250 million years ago.

- en: Another possible explanation for why beetles are so rich in species is that,
    in addition to being old, they have unusual staying power. “They have survived
    at least two mass extinctions,” says [Cristian Beza-Beza](https://entomology.umn.edu/people/cristian-beza-beza),
    a University of Minnesota postdoctoral fellow. Indeed, a 2015 study using fossil
    beetles to explore extinctions as far back as the Permian 284 million years ago
    concluded that [lack of extinction](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.0060)
    may be at least as important as diversification for explaining beetle species
    abundance. In past eras, at least, beetles have demonstrated a striking ability
    to shift their ranges in response to climate change, and this may explain their
    extinction resilience, the authors hypothesize.

    of the beetle family tree have many more species than others. For example, dung
    beetles, which spend their lives rolling deftly crafted balls of excrement, are
    only modestly diverse. “This family is around 8,000 species, so it’s not a huge
    group,” says community ecologist[Jorge Ari Noriega](https://unsm-ento.unl.edu/workers/JNoriega.html)

    one explanation holds very well for any one group,” says McKenna. Still, among
    plant-eating beetles — which make up roughly a quarter of all beetle species —
    a clear pattern is emerging. Based on genetic analyses of different beetle lineages,
    McKenna and his colleagues have found evidence that a major factor spurring beetle
    diversity was the [diversification of flowering plants](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/new-history-tropical-forests-americas)
    during the Cretaceous period.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the Cretaceous period, which started around 145 million years ago, an
    explosion of new flowering plant species spread across the Earth’s surface, colonizing
    many different habitats. Today, plants make up about 80 percent of the mass of
    Earth’s life. Making the most of plants as food is an ecological strategy that
    has helped fuel the radiation of not only beetles but also herbivorousspecies
    including ants, bees, birds and mammals.

- en: In the case of herbivorous beetles, their most species-rich lineages carry a
    fascinating assortment of genes that permit the digestion of plants, McKenna has
    found. Many of these genes code for enzymes that help to break down plant cell
    walls, allowing access to sugars stored in hard-to-digest compounds like cellulose,
    hemicellulose and pectin. “The lineages that have these genes were the ones that
    are so incredibly successful,” McKenna says.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These genes were ingenious adaptations that turned indigestible plant parts
    into food. They allowed herbivorous beetles to eat more and different kinds of
    plants, which in turn enabled the insects to move into new habitats and occupy
    new ecological niches. As plant-eating beetles spread out geographically and adopted
    different diets and lifestyles, the genetic differences between them grew, resulting
    in new species.

    genes as they evolved, including a gene coding for pectinase, an enzyme that enables
    the breakdown of pectin. Evolutionary ecologist [Hassan Salem](https://www.phd.tuebingen.mpg.de/5292/hassan-salem)
    at the Max Planck Institute for Biology in Tübingen, Germany, explains that to
    compensate, some beetles evolved a different strategy for eating plants: They
    forged relationships with bacterial partners — called symbionts — that also aid
    plant digestion.'

- en: 'For some beetles, these special symbiotic microbes became an alternate tool
    for keeping plants on the menu, expanding the number of habitats where new species
    could evolve and thrive. For example, in the vast majority of tortoise leaf beetle
    species, the group Salem studies, it’s not a genetically encoded enzyme that breaks
    down pectin, but a bacterial symbiont. The beetles get the bacteria from their
    mothers: Every time a female deposits an egg, she also leaves behind a capsule
    containing the microbes. The tortoise beetle embryo develops inside the egg, then
    burrows into the capsule to digest the symbiont about a day before it emerges.'

    says Salem. When Salem and his team have experimentally removed the microbe caplets
    from developing larvae, the adult, germ-free beetles that emerge have a high mortality
    rate because they can’t access pectin in the plant cell.

- en: In addition to making plants easier to digest, some plant-associated microbes
    may have paved the way for beetle diversification because they provide beetles
    with predator protection. In the tortoise leaf beetle *Chelymorpha alternans,*
    for example, a fungus called *Fusarium* — often found in crops like bananas and
    sweet potatoes — grows on the surface of beetle pupae during metamorphosis. “We’ve
    demonstrated that if you remove the fungus, then ants readily find them and feed
    on them,” says [Aileen Berasategui](https://www.berasateguilab.com/), an evolutionary
    biologist at the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment in the Netherlands.
    *Fusarium*, in other words, may be shielding the beetles from harmful predators,
    further expanding beetle territory and enabling diversification.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Berasategui adds that plenty of bark beetles, like ambrosia beetles, also benefit
    from *Fusarium*fungi, but in a different way. The beetles carry the fungi from
    tree to tree in specialized pockets called mycangia. Once the tree’s fungal infection
    is underway, the beetles indulge in a fungi feast.

- en: Adapting to conduct this kind of agriculture — sowing spores that will grow
    into food — has also helped beetle species to exploit new habitats. “From their
    own nest, they take a little piece, and then … fly to a new tree where they start
    their own nest, they sow the new fungus, they generate this new garden,” says
    Berasategui. Called fungiculture, the approach has independently evolved in ambrosia
    beetles seven times. The evolution of new beetle species is thought to have been
    shaped by mutually beneficial relationships with these fungi — part of [a 50-million-year
    history](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626)
    in which insects such as ants, termites and ambrosia beetles have independently
    evolved to farm fungi, according to a 2005 article published in the *Annual Review
    of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics*.

    to speciate more than other beetle groups. In the leaf beetles that Chaboo studies,
    for example, the emergence in the fossil record of defensive fecal shields — structures
    built from a beetle’s own excretions and sloughed-off skin — “coincide with massive
    species radiations,” she says. Most beetle shield-users are solitary species,
    but some live in groups, arranging themselves in formations that protect them
    from predators. Fecal shield protection may have helped the beetles move into
    more open habitats, Chaboo says.
