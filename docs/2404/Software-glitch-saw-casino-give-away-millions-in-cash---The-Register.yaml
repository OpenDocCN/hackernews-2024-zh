    give away millions in cash without realizing it – for weeks.

    which has had years of compliance troubles that led to a finding that its operators
    were unsuitable to hold a license.

    use to redeem barcoded receipts for slot machine winnings.

    [PDF] given on Monday to the inquiry, casino manager Nicholas Weeks explained
    that it is possible to insert two receipts into TICO machines. That was a feature,
    not a bug, and allowed gamblers to redeem two receipts and be paid the aggregate
    amount.

    and allow it to be re-used – the barcode it bore was not recognized as having
    been paid.

    that news of the free cash got around and 43 people used the TICO machines to
    withdraw money to which they were not entitled – at least one of them a recovering
    gambling addict who fell off the wagon as the "free" money allowed them to fund
    their activities.

    face the courts is accused of association with a criminal group. (The first inquiry
    into The Star, two years ago, found it may have been targeted by organized crime
    groups.)

    in relation to the level of rigor through which controls are followed, the level
    of care in which work is conducted, and the desire from people in the business
    to drill down on things in circumstances where they don't appear that they are
    correct."

- en: The fresh inquiry into Star Casino was called after its response to earlier
    probes was felt to have fallen short. Testimony this week has also revealed that
    the casino's analysts don't get enough info to do their jobs well, and that facial
    recognition systems don't include images of some who should have completed source
    of wealth checks designed to detect possible money laundering. Those who did not
    complete their checks could therefore still enter the casino and gamble large
    sums of money. ®
