    to [browse parts of the web anonymously](https://www.popsci.com/article/technology/end-anonymity/).
    Over a dozen states, including [Texas](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-wins-after-pornography-companies-sued-texas-over-age-verification#:~:text=HB%201181%20requires%20purveyors%20of,injunction%20from%20a%20district%20court.)
    and [Louisiana](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/08/1147762020/louisianas-new-porn-law-carries-user-privacy-risks),
    have enacted legislation forcing Pornhub and other purveyors of streaming online
    adult videos to verify the identities of its users to ensure children and teens
    aren’t accessing “sexual material harmful to minors.” Elsewhere, in states like
    [Florida](https://www.flgov.com/2024/03/25/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-children-and-uphold-parental-rights/),
    lawmakers have introduced so-called [online parental consent laws](https://gizmodo.com/9-states-kids-social-media-block-age-gate-social-media-1850567724#:~:text=The%20law,%20called%20the%20Securing,under%20the%20age%20of%2018.)
    that would limit or ban underage users from accessing social media services over
    [claims they cause psychological harm](https://gizmodo.com/surgeon-general-kids-social-media-warning-instagram-1850465452).
    In each case, lawmakers want online platforms to collect government-IDs from users
    or have them submit to third-party age verification methods to ensure they are
    indeed adults.

    means platforms have no choice but to verify the ages of all users accessing their
    sites, minor or otherwise. Adult porn viewers, who could previously dip in and
    out of websites with a relative degree of anonymity, may now fear having their
    government name and photograph at arms length away from their last Pornhub search
    query. At the same time, critics of the new laws worry some far-right, religiously
    conservative lawmakers [could broadly interpret](https://x.com/heritage/status/1660111875818790913?s=61)
    “adult” material to include content from LGBTQ+ creators or other people from
    [marginalized groups who rely on the internet for a sense of community](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/law-should-not-require-parental-consent-all-minors-access-social-media).
    In that scenario, teens from abusive or difficult family structures could find
    themselves shut out from support structures online.

    blocked materials. Leading VPN provider Top10 VPN claims demand from VPN services
    [jumped 275% on March 15](https://www.top10vpn.com/research/vpn-demand-statistics/),
    the same day Pornhub cut off access in Texas. The site says demand for [VPNs](https://www.popsci.com/technology/how-does-a-vpn-work/)
    similarly surged by 210% the day after a similar law took effect in Louisiana
    last year. ExpressVPN, another popular VPN provider, told *PopSci* it saw increased
    web traffic to its site the day anti-porn, online age verification bills took
    effect in seven out of eight states.

    data and can make it appear as if their computer is based in a different geographical
    location. Digital streaming viewers often use this VPN masking technology to access
    shows restricted in certain markets and [blacked out sports events](https://cybernews.com/how-to-use-vpn/how-to-get-around-espn-blackout/#workaround-with-a-vpn).
    Others view VPNs as useful tools for adding layers of security to private communications.
    That same technology has, for years, been used by whistleblowers, journalists,
    and political dissidents worldwide to bolster their anonymity online, especially
    in authoritarian countries.

    use by Americans to sidestep domestic content restrictions feels “relatively new.”
    That sudden shift, Jain said, owes itself partly to the language of these new
    laws which would have previously struggled to stand up to legal scrutiny. Jain,
    whose organization [signed onto an amicus’s brief](https://cdt.org/insights/cdt-and-rights-groups-file-amicus-brief-in-texas-online-age-verification-case/)
    calling on a court to block the Texas law, said he wasn’t surprised users from

    have passed some form of legislation relying on age-verification to prevent minors
    from accessing pornographic material. Nearly all of these so-called “age-gating”
    bills are copy-cat versions of a [pioneering Louisiana legislation](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1146933317/louisiana-new-porn-law-government-id-restriction-privacy),
    which passed in 2022 and took effect early last year. *The Verge* [estimates](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/29/23849375/kosa-child-safety-free-speech-louisiana-utah-parental-consent)
    the Louisiana bill inspired at least 17 copycat bills, a handful of which are
    on their way to becoming laws. In Texas, sites found in violation of its law [could
    face penalties of up to $10,000 per day](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/leading-adult-entertainment-website-blocks-service-in-texas/).

    from states with these new laws in order to avoid running afoul of the laws. Last
    month, internet users in Texas attempting to access the world’s largest purveyor
    of online adult video content were greeted instead with a 10 paragraph note from
    the company explaining its opposition to the state’s “ineffective, haphazard,
    and dangerous” law. Pornhub has similarly [restricted access to users from half
    a dozen other states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/14/porn-texas-shut-down/72976270007/)
    with similar age verification laws. In addition to wanting to steer clear of penalties,
    experts told *PopSci* platforms also oppose the laws because they don’t want to
    be responsible for collecting and maintaining torrents of sensitive users’ data
    that could pose a ripe target for cybercriminals.

    any site you access that features adult content,” Hendry Parsons said. “Combined
    with the data profiling social media companies create about their users, this
    treasure trove of personal information is a perfect target for bad actors.”

    In Montana, where lawmakers passed a first-of-its kind statewide TikTok ban, creators
    have been preparing to similarly use the technology to stay connected to their

    kinds will inevitably find themselves running into a VPN service willing to offer

    Internet users appearing to use VPNs to blatantly run afoul of new legislation
    could incentivize lawmakers to clamp down on the technology. Some of the anti-porn
    laws, [like the one enacted in Utah](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/05/utahs-porn-crackdown-has-vpn-problem/),
    already possess language explicitly prohibiting online platforms from letting
    minors “change or bypass restrictions on access.” Digital rights activists fear
    other recently proposed legislation aimed at limiting US user access to foreign
    apps may include provisions in it that would [criminalize the use of VPNs](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3ddb/restrict-act-insanely-broad-ban-tiktok-vpns).

    one of those laws could eventually make its way up to the Supreme Court.
