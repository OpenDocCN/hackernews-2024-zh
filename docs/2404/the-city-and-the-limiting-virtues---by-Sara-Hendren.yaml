- en: I sent my architecture students to Faro and two other nearby sites this spring
    — a scavenger hunt to find some of the “limiting virtues” embedded in buildings.
    I got inspired by David McPherson’s *[The Virtues of Limits](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-virtues-of-limits-9780192848536?cc=us&lang=en&)*,
    where he lays out humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness,
    and loyalty as virtues that constrain us in order to set us free.

  zh: 今年春天，我带我的建筑学生去了法罗和附近的另外两个地点 —— 一个寻找嵌入建筑中的“限制美德”的寻宝游戏。我受到了David McPherson的《*[The
    Virtues of Limits](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-virtues-of-limits-9780192848536?cc=us&lang=en&)*》的启发，他列出了谦逊、尊重、节制、满足、睦邻和忠诚作为限制我们以使我们自由的美德。
- en: All these virtues are laudable, surely, but not exactly high on the aspirational
    list in a culture more enamored of the active virtues, like courage and magnanimity.
    I wanted students to see where a built space takes away some freedoms — enforcing
    the **moderation** and **contentment** that mitigates all-screens-all-the-time,
    for example — and thereby opens up other freedoms. A no-laptops policy means you
    can’t get a certain kind of work done, but it does mean everyone present will
    be a little more eyes-up-and-talking, or maybe absorbed by a book or notebook.
    The activities will be at the speed of the body, one to another. Is it nostalgic
    and precious? Maybe. But it’s not the only café in town to make this move, and
    I think there’s some signal there. Faro started out with no-laptops only on weekends,
    and the policy was welcome enough to make it a daily norm. Over at [Zuzu’s Petals](https://www.zuzuspetalscambridge.com/),
    it’s no devices of any kind.

  zh: 所有这些美德无疑值得赞赏，但在一个更喜欢主动美德（如勇气和宽宏大量）的文化中，并不是高居渴望名单的东西。我希望学生们能看到建筑空间如何剥夺了一些自由 ——
    例如强调减少全时屏幕的**适度**和**满足**，从而打开其他自由。禁止笔记本电脑的政策意味着你无法完成某种类型的工作，但这确实意味着在场的每个人都会更多地抬头交谈，或者可能沉浸在一本书或笔记本中。活动的速度会随着身体而定，一人到另一人。这是怀旧和珍贵吗？也许是。但这并不是镇上唯一一个采取这一举措的咖啡馆，我认为这里有一些信号。法罗最初只在周末禁止使用笔记本电脑，而这一政策受到了足够的欢迎，使其成为每日的规范。在[Zuzu's
    Petals](https://www.zuzuspetalscambridge.com/)，任何设备都不能使用。

    as you are, but **reverence** is always encouraged — including in the weekday
    noon masses sung by a boys’ choir, complete with Elizabethan collars. (St. Paul’s
    has one of the only choir schools in the United States!) Sacred spaces aren’t
    a popular subject in architecture schools except as antiquarian study, I find.
    I suggested students visit either this great cavernous space in the middle of
    the bustling university square or the [Cambridge Insight Meditation Center](https://cambridgeinsight.org/)
    nearby, with its beautifully pared-down top floor of a grand old Victorian house.
    I could also have suggested a visit to the nearby monks’ dwelling at the [Society
    of Saint John the Evangelist](https://www.ssje.org/), whose exquisite stone chapel
    often features a sandwich board out front, enticing passersby not with lunch deals
    or storewide discounts but that rarest (limiting) thing: silence.'

    substrate of an “accepting-appreciating” stance toward the world, as opposed to
    the “choosing-controlling” stance that is the naturalized, invisible, and totalizing
    definition of 21st century technocratic freedom. No one wants life without choices,
    of course. But McPherson writes that the limiting virtue of **loyalty** — especially
    “loyalty to the given world” — is one way to cultivate this accepting-appreciating
    posture and to enjoy the freedom that it brings.

    century, Western societies have been defined by “a generalized culture of ‘authenticity,’
    or expressive individualism, in which people are encouraged to find their own
    way, discover their own fulfillment, ‘do their own thing.’” Taylor describes a
    phenomenon that’s all too easy to recognize in today’s pop psychology and the
    maundering of wellness influencers, but his concept doesn’t quite capture the
    extent to which this relentless quest for self-optimizing authenticity has infused
    our social and even political sensibilities.

    a whole panoply of richly imagined and specific spaces, containers built with

    with “enhanced autonomy”— a life with choices that are also informed by our **loyalty**
    to the given, unchosen world — what we might just call living with *obligations*.
