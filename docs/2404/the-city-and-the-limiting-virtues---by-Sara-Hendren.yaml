    and it’s got a no-laptops policy that is gently, but strictly, enforced.

    outlawed laptops — upright and rectangular cognitive anchors that suck all energy
    toward themselves. Multiplied across a room, laptops erect an office where a café
    had been. And Faro is trying to keep the office at bay.

    doors down in a couple directions and find some good ones. But Faro has their
    little manifesto printed and hung on one wall — unobtrusive, easy to miss — and
    they just want something else happening in the space.

- en: I sent my architecture students to Faro and two other nearby sites this spring
    — a scavenger hunt to find some of the “limiting virtues” embedded in buildings.
    I got inspired by David McPherson’s *[The Virtues of Limits](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-virtues-of-limits-9780192848536?cc=us&lang=en&)*,
    where he lays out humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness,
    and loyalty as virtues that constrain us in order to set us free.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these virtues are laudable, surely, but not exactly high on the aspirational
    list in a culture more enamored of the active virtues, like courage and magnanimity.
    I wanted students to see where a built space takes away some freedoms — enforcing
    the **moderation** and **contentment** that mitigates all-screens-all-the-time,
    for example — and thereby opens up other freedoms. A no-laptops policy means you
    can’t get a certain kind of work done, but it does mean everyone present will
    be a little more eyes-up-and-talking, or maybe absorbed by a book or notebook.
    The activities will be at the speed of the body, one to another. Is it nostalgic
    and precious? Maybe. But it’s not the only café in town to make this move, and
    I think there’s some signal there. Faro started out with no-laptops only on weekends,
    and the policy was welcome enough to make it a daily norm. Over at [Zuzu’s Petals](https://www.zuzuspetalscambridge.com/),
    it’s no devices of any kind.

    as you are, but **reverence** is always encouraged — including in the weekday
    noon masses sung by a boys’ choir, complete with Elizabethan collars. (St. Paul’s
    has one of the only choir schools in the United States!) Sacred spaces aren’t
    a popular subject in architecture schools except as antiquarian study, I find.
    I suggested students visit either this great cavernous space in the middle of
    the bustling university square or the [Cambridge Insight Meditation Center](https://cambridgeinsight.org/)
    nearby, with its beautifully pared-down top floor of a grand old Victorian house.
    I could also have suggested a visit to the nearby monks’ dwelling at the [Society
    of Saint John the Evangelist](https://www.ssje.org/), whose exquisite stone chapel
    often features a sandwich board out front, enticing passersby not with lunch deals
    or storewide discounts but that rarest (limiting) thing: silence.'

    The second floor features enclosed meeting spaces for groups on a first-come,
    first-serve basis, plus a *really really* quiet room for patrons wanting the moderation
    of all notifications off. The entire third floor is devoted to children — a beautiful
    raucous energy, with activity rooms, cozy nooks, and floor-to-ceiling windows
    on every side. A teen room in the old structure holds high-backed wing chairs
    and booths for semi-sedentary socializing, and a maker space occupies much of
    the basement. Things you *can* do and things you *can’t,* by design.'

- en: McPherson writes that the limiting virtues are grounded in the dispositional
    substrate of an “accepting-appreciating” stance toward the world, as opposed to
    the “choosing-controlling” stance that is the naturalized, invisible, and totalizing
    definition of 21st century technocratic freedom. No one wants life without choices,
    of course. But McPherson writes that the limiting virtue of **loyalty** — especially
    “loyalty to the given world” — is one way to cultivate this accepting-appreciating
    posture and to enjoy the freedom that it brings.

    or informal constraints — whether imposed by states, faith systems, or other people
    —should impede each of us from achieving personal growth. This attitude is *therapeutic*
    because it is invariably couched in self-help babble. And it is *libertarian*
    not only because it makes a cult out of personal freedom, but because it applies
    market logic to human beings. We are all our own start-ups. We must all adopt
    a pro-growth mindset for our personhood and deregulate our desires. We must all
    assess and reassess our own “fulfillment,” a kind of psychological Gross Domestic
    Product, on a near-constant basis. And like the GDP, our fulfillment must always
    increase.

    finds its account of polyamory not a breathless liberation but an anguished slog
    of misery, led by endless choices. Some philosophers would call this “radical
    autonomy” — the idea that a choice is automatically good just for having been
    chosen. Harper is skewering the particular alloy of individualism and therapy-speak

    of wealthy, elite culture in the 2020s, and a neat encapsulation of its flaws.
    This culture would have us believe that interminable self-improvement projects,
    navel-gazing, and sexual peccadilloes are the new face of progress. The climate
    warms, wars rage, and our country lurches toward a perilous election—all problems
    that require real action, real progress. And somehow “you do you” has become the
    American ruling class’s three-word bible.

- en: The philosopher Charles Taylor has argued that, since at least the late 20th
    century, Western societies have been defined by “a generalized culture of ‘authenticity,’
    or expressive individualism, in which people are encouraged to find their own
    way, discover their own fulfillment, ‘do their own thing.’” Taylor describes a
    phenomenon that’s all too easy to recognize in today’s pop psychology and the
    maundering of wellness influencers, but his concept doesn’t quite capture the
    extent to which this relentless quest for self-optimizing authenticity has infused
    our social and even political sensibilities.

    and all-choices box of a room isn’t always what’s called for. It *sounds* right
    — surely your client wants a space that could be anything you need it to be —
    but unprogrammed space is often tractionless, characterless. A city should contain
    a whole panoply of richly imagined and specific spaces, containers built with
    interior features for freedoms and limits alike. McPherson calls us to a life
    with “enhanced autonomy”— a life with choices that are also informed by our **loyalty**
    to the given, unchosen world — what we might just call living with *obligations*.
    I’d like to see designers take a renewed look at limits in their partnership for
    civic goods: rules that constrain and liberate.'

    film, start to finish, between January and this week — a partnership with my husband
    and co-producer, [Brian Funck](https://www.brianfunck.com/), who is a genius.
    It’ll premiere at the [Design for All?](https://museum-gestaltung.ch/en/ausstellung/design-fuer-alle-vielfalt-als-norm/)
    show at Museum für Gestaltung Zürich this summer and afterward in an online channel
    near you, I hope! Stay tuned. I’ve got the short film bug for sure; at least two
    others, also in dialogue with scientific ideas, are in the hopper.
