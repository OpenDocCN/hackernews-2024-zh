- en: The sight of Bill Boeing was a familiar one on the factory floor. His office
    was in the building next to the converted boatyard where workers lathed the wood,
    sewed the fabric wings, and fixed the control wires of the Boeing Model C airplane.
    there is no authority except facts. facts are obtained by accurate observation
    read a plaque affixed outside the door. And what could need closer observation
    than the process of his aircraft being built? One day in 1916, Boeing spotted
    an imperfectly cut wing rib, dropped it to the floor, and slowly stomped it to
    bits. “I, for one, will close up shop rather than send out work of this kind,”
    he declared.

    made a rare appearance on the shop floor in Seattle one day this past January,
    circumstances were decidedly different. Firmly a member of the CEO class, schooled
    at the knee of General Electric’s Jack Welch, Calhoun had not strolled over from
    next door but flown some 2,300 miles from Boeing’s headquarters in Arlington,
    Virginia. And he was not there to observe slipshod work before it found its way
    into the air—it already had. A few weeks earlier, the door of a Boeing 737 had
    [fallen out](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000009253435/alaska-airlines-emergency-landing.html)
    mid-flight. In the days following his visit, Calhoun’s office admitted that it
    still didn’t know quite what had gone wrong, because it didn’t know how the plane
    had been put together in the first place. The door’s restraining bolts had either
    been screwed in wrong, or not at all. Boeing [couldn’t say](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/boeing-admits-it-cant-find-work-records-for-panel-that-blew-out-on-alaska-airlines-flight),

- en: 'The two scenes tell us the peculiar story of a plane maker that, over 25 years,
    slowly but very deliberately extracted itself from the business of making planes.
    For nearly 40 years the company built the 737 fuselage itself in the same plant
    that turned out its B-29 and B-52 bombers. In 2005 it sold this facility to a
    private-investment firm, keeping the axle grease at arm’s length and notionally
    shifting risk, capital costs, and labor woes off its books onto its “supplier.”
    *Offloading*, Boeing called it. Meanwhile the tail, landing gear, flight controls,
    and other essentials were outsourced to factories around the world owned by others,
    and shipped to Boeing for final assembly, turning the company that created the
    Jet Age into something akin to a glorified gluer-together of precast model-airplane
    kits. Boeing’s latest screwups vividly dramatize a point often missed in laments
    of America’s manufacturing decline: that when global economic forces carried off
    some U.S. manufacturers for good, even the ones that stuck around lost interest
    in actually making stuff.'

  zh: 这两个场景讲述了一个特别的故事，一个飞机制造商在25年间，缓慢而有意识地退出了制造飞机的业务。几乎40年来，波音公司在同一工厂内生产737机身，这个工厂曾生产B-29和B-52轰炸机。2005年，公司将这个设施出售给一家私人投资公司，将润滑脂保持在一定距离之外，并将风险、资本成本和劳动问题概念上转移给了其"供应商"。波音称之为"卸货"。与此同时，尾翼、起落架、飞行控制及其他关键部件被外包到全球各地的工厂，并运送到波音进行最终装配，将创造喷气时代的公司变成了一个类似于高级模型飞机组装的公司。波音公司最近的错误生动地表现出一点，常常在抱怨美国制造业衰退时被忽略的一点：当全球经济力量永久带走一些美国制造商时，即使是那些留了下来的，也失去了对实际制造产品的兴趣。

    —— 但这是你指着说：“孩子们，那列火车上有一架波音飞机！”不对。车身侧面的商标清楚地写着：堪萨斯州威奇托的Spirit AeroSystems制造了这个机身，这不是来自波音的，而是要运送到波音去的。

    fall just might have provided that rush of clarity. You could be from the 12th
    century and still *know* that soap and cheesecloth aren’t for making flying machines.
    Boeing’s chief financial officer recently admitted that the company got “a little
    too far ahead of itself on the topic of outsourcing.” It is in talks to reacquire
    Spirit AeroSystems and is already making the composite wings of its next-gen plane,

    Moore’s Law (the doubling of computing power roughly every 18 months) flows not
    from above but from manufacturing advances it once dominated. It has undertaken
    a “[death march](https://www.wired.com/story/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-ai-comeback/),”
    in the words of CEO Pat Gelsinger, to regain its lost edge on the foundry floor.
    The CHIPS Act has put a powerful political wind at his back. Green and other incentives
    are powering a broader, truly seismic surge in spending on new U.S. factories,
    now going up at three times their normal rate. No other country is experiencing
    such a buildout.
