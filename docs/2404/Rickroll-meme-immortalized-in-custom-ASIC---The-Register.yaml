- en: The project is a product of Matthew Venn's [Zero to ASIC Course](https://zerotoasiccourse.com/),
    which offers prospective chip engineers the chance to "learn to design your own
    ASIC and get it fabricated." Since 2020, Zero to ASIC has accepted several designs
    that are incorporated into a single chip called a multi-project wafer (MPW), a
    cost-saving measure as making one chip for one design would be prohibitively expensive.

- en: 'Zero to ASIC has two series of chips: MPW and Tiny Tapeout. The MPW series
    usually includes just a handful of designs, such as the four on MPW8 [submitted](https://zerotoasiccourse.com/post/mpw8_submitted/)
    in January 2023\. By contrast, the original Tiny Tapeout chip included [152 designs](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt01/),
    and Tiny Tapeout 2 (which arrived last October) had 165, though could bumped up
    to 250.'

    may strike a chord: Design 145, or [the Secret File](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/145/),
    made by engineer and YouTuber Bitluni. His Secret File [design](https://github.com/bitluni/tt02-SecretFile)
    for the Tiny Tapeout ASIC is designed to play a small part of Rick Astley''s music
    video for Never Gonna Give You Up, also known as the Rickroll meme.'

    just three days before the submission deadline. He initially just made a persistence-of-vision
    controller, which was revised twice for a total of three designs.

    upload a meme project," Bitluni says [in his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdF_nzMW_i8)
    documenting his ASIC journey. His meme of choice was of course the Rickroll. One
    might even call it an Easter egg.'

    a ton of room for both the graphics processor and the file it was supposed to
    render, a short GIF of the music video. Ultimately, this had to be shrunk from
    217 kilobytes to less than half a kilobyte, making its output look similar to
    games on the Atari 2600 from 1977.

- en: Accessing the Rickroll rendering processor and other designs isn't simple. Bitluni
    created a custom circuit board to mount the Tiny Tapeout 2 chip, creating a device
    that could then be plugged into a motherboard capable of selecting specific designs
    on the ASIC. Unfortunately for Bitluni, his first PCB had a design error on it
    that he had to correct, but the revised version worked and was able to display
    the Rickroll GIF in hardware via a VGA port.

    that estimates pi to 1,000 decimal places. The chip is fabricated by Efabless's
    ChipIgnite shuttle program using the Skywater 130nm open source PDK.

    can serve as useful proofs of concept for aspiring chip designers who want to
    see their designs on real silicon. It's very expensive to fab a single wafer of
    chips, and far out of reach for the average student or hobbyist to do so.

    for the Zero to ASIC course is $650, far more expensive than $100 FPGAs that are
    capable of being programmed to do far more complicated things. That's certainly
    a big premium just so a chip can be considered custom-made.

    source and can be inspected by anyone, which means those of you interested in
    the low-level design of chips and hardware languages can dive in and check it
    all out.

    underway. In fact, Tiny Tapeout 3 to 6 have already closed submissions, and all
    are expected to arrive over the course of the year. Submissions for Tiny Tapeout
    7, 8, and 9 are open, with Tiny Tapeout 7 slated for a December launch, and 8
    and 9 for mid-2025.

    Tapeout 3](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt03/) won't be free of memes either.
    Design 16, Bad Apple, plays the Touhou-based Bad Apple song over a piezo speaker,
    and design 77 is an AI decelerator that is "guaranteed to slow down your AI model
    training." Tiny Tapeout 2's Rickroll design is also ported over to Tiny Tapeout
    3\. ®
