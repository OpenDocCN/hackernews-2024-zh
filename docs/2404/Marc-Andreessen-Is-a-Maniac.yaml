    beliefs. From a distance, the venture capitalist spouts your [standard brand of
    right-wing libertarianism](https://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/techs_toxic_political_culture_the_stealth_libertarianism_of_silicon_valley_bigwigs/),
    but he’s also somehow a [huge fan of the Pentagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lQWIFi0D4k).
    He’s a [big fan of “America”](https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/)
    but doesn’t seem to like most Americans very much. His VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz,
    has claimed that the U.S. government is being strangled by special interests and
    lobbying but, last year, he [spent an ungodly amount of money](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2024/04/19/gundo-bros-silicon-valley-military/?sh=150a428852c9)

    to his core beliefs they seem pretty simple. He’s a big fan of power. That is
    power for certain people—i.e., people like him. Rich people, in other words. I
    used to consider Andreessen to be something of a buffoon—a guy who has been so
    rich for so long that it’s effectively addled his brain. His love of investing
    [in bad ideas](https://fortune.com/2023/07/13/adam-neumann-why-marc-andreessen-invested-flow-wework/)
    had me convinced of this. Now, however, I think a more apt descriptor might be
    “maniac.” He seems like a zealous believer in anything that helps sustain or enhance
    the American elite’s power accumulation, all other considerations be damned.

    a storied timeline lays claim to a host of impressive historical events—the Wright
    brothers’ first flight, the invention of the transistor, the Manhattan Project,
    the moon landing—and frames them all as part of the American Dynamism “movement,”
    as if A16z had something to do with any of that stuff. “American Dynamism embodies
    the spirit of innovation, progress, and resilience that drives the United States
    forward. This powerful force is exemplified by groundbreaking achievements in
    technology and innovation, shaping both our nation and the global landscape,”
    the site says. A site visitor reading through this garbage might be distracted

    The attitude seems to be: throw anything at the wall, so long as it accelerates
    your money and power—deregulation, technological disruption, berzerk AI, missiles

    laid bare last year in his “[Techno-Optimist’s Manifesto,](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/)”
    which he published on his venture capital firm’s blog. Said “manifesto” is basically
    a spastic apology for corporate greed and wealth accumulation by a technocratic

    “I’m not saying we should have sweatshops in the US and I’m not saying we should
