    beliefs. From a distance, the venture capitalist spouts your [standard brand of
    right-wing libertarianism](https://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/techs_toxic_political_culture_the_stealth_libertarianism_of_silicon_valley_bigwigs/),
    but he’s also somehow a [huge fan of the Pentagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lQWIFi0D4k).
    He’s a [big fan of “America”](https://fortune.com/longform/andreessen-horowitz-beyond-silicon-valley/)
    but doesn’t seem to like most Americans very much. His VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz,
    has claimed that the U.S. government is being strangled by special interests and
    lobbying but, last year, he [spent an ungodly amount of money](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2024/04/19/gundo-bros-silicon-valley-military/?sh=150a428852c9)
    lobbying that same government.

- en: While Andreessen may be all over the place ideologically, when you burrow down
    to his core beliefs they seem pretty simple. He’s a big fan of power. That is
    power for certain people—i.e., people like him. Rich people, in other words. I
    used to consider Andreessen to be something of a buffoon—a guy who has been so
    rich for so long that it’s effectively addled his brain. His love of investing
    [in bad ideas](https://fortune.com/2023/07/13/adam-neumann-why-marc-andreessen-invested-flow-wework/)
    had me convinced of this. Now, however, I think a more apt descriptor might be
    “maniac.” He seems like a zealous believer in anything that helps sustain or enhance
    the American elite’s power accumulation, all other considerations be damned.

    about Andreessen Horowitz’s relatively new American Dynamism fund, which is populated

    feeding the American War Machine might be a bit taboo. But, no, he seems perfectly
    fine with it. The story focuses on the “Gundo Bros,” a gaggle of patriotic software
    developers attached to defense startups that are endorsed by a16z. Said “bros”
    sound like they mostly take their cues from 1980s action movies:'

    a storied timeline lays claim to a host of impressive historical events—the Wright
    brothers’ first flight, the invention of the transistor, the Manhattan Project,
    the moon landing—and frames them all as part of the American Dynamism “movement,”
    as if A16z had something to do with any of that stuff. “American Dynamism embodies
    the spirit of innovation, progress, and resilience that drives the United States
    forward. This powerful force is exemplified by groundbreaking achievements in
    technology and innovation, shaping both our nation and the global landscape,”
    the site says. A site visitor reading through this garbage might be distracted
    enough to forget that the fund is [promoting a host of private defense, surveillance,
    and weapons contractors](https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-50/) who will hoard
    breakthroughs for themselves.

    The attitude seems to be: throw anything at the wall, so long as it accelerates
    your money and power—deregulation, technological disruption, berzerk AI, missiles
    and bombs—it’s all good stuff! Some tenets of Andreessen’s belief system were
    laid bare last year in his “[Techno-Optimist’s Manifesto,](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/)”
    which he published on his venture capital firm’s blog. Said “manifesto” is basically
    a spastic apology for corporate greed and wealth accumulation by a technocratic
    elite. It reads like some weird mixture of Gordon Gekko and Steve Jobs’ keynote
    speeches with a little bit of Patrick Bateman rhetoric thrown in.'

    wouldn’t think fondly of the segments of society that don’t conform to his ubermensch-style
    aspirations. That is to say, The American Prospect published [a personal essay](https://prospect.org/power/2024-04-24-my-dinner-with-andreessen/)
    by the author Rick Perlstein last week that seems to provide further evidence
    of Andreessen’s hopelessly elitist outlook.

    fondness for anyone who doesn’t have a massive bank account. Among the charming
    things he’s reportedly said over the years is that the American middle class [was
    an “accident of history,”](https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-american-middle-class-an-accident-2014-10)
    that the American middle class “is a myth” and/or an “artifact” and [that it was

    “experiment [that] has been run and it was a catastrophic failure.” Another fun
    thing [Andreessen has said](https://qz.com/36368/eight-things-marc-andreessen-said-to-quartz-that-made-us-sit-up-and-listen):
    “I’m not saying we should have sweatshops in the US and I’m not saying we should

    in the US than it is to do business in a lot of places around the world.”'

    and the best thing that rural Americans can do is take painkillers and play video
    games, but the American war machine is totally awesome...it feels like you can
    draw a pretty clear picture of what Andreessen thinks about the majority of Americans
    and where he thinks our country should go. You’d be forgiven if you aren’t as
    excited about it as he is.
