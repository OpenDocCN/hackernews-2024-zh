- en: This article delves into Google’s dominance of the browser market, highlighting
    how Google’s Chrome browser is playing a critical role in asserting Google’s dominance
    in other markets. While Google perpetuates the perception that Google Chrome is
    a neutral platform built on open-source technologies, we argue that Chrome is
    instrumental in Google’s strategy to reinforce its dominance in online advertising,
    publishing, and the browser market itself. Our examination of Google’s strategic
    acquisitions, anti-competitive practices, and the implementation of so-called
    “privacy controls,” shows that Chrome is far from a neutral gateway to the web.
    Rather, it serves as a key tool for Google to maintain and extend its market power,
    often to the detriment of competition and innovation.

    publishing through practices such as coercion, self-preferencing, it also helps
    leverage its advertising clout to engage in a “pay-to-play” paradigm, which serves
    as a cornerstone in Google’s larger strategy of market control. We also discuss
    potential regulatory interventions and remedies, drawing on historical antitrust
    precedents. We propose a triad of solutions motivated from our analysis of Google’s
    abuse of Chrome: behavioral remedies targeting specific anti-competitive practices,
    structural remedies involving an internal separation of Google’s divisions, and
    divestment of Chrome from Google.'

    escaped antitrust scrutiny—a gap our article aims to bridge. Addressing this gap
    is instrumental to solve current market imbalances and future challenges brought
    on by increasingly hegemonizing technology firms, ensuring a competitive digital
    environment that nurtures innovation and safeguards consumer interests.
