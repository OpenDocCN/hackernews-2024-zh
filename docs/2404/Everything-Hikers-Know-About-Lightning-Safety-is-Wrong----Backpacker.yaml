    outdoors club, I was taught that assuming the “lightning position” was the best
    way to protect yourself in a thunderstorm (spoiler alert: it does bugger-all).
    If you managed to avoid this particular tidbit of backcountry lore, allow me to
    provide a refresher: the lightning position involves crouching down on a sleeping
    pad with your heels touching, your chest pressed against your knees, and your
    hands clamped over your ears. It’s supposed to limit your likelihood of getting
    electrocuted.'

    now saying the lightning position can only *slightly* mitigate risk and should
    only be used as a last resort. But many, including the National Outdoor Leadership
    School (NOLS), still suggest sitting on a sleeping pad as a worst-case-scenario
    way to help insulate your body from ground strikes once you’ve tried everything
    else (it doesn’t help). And others, including the Boy Scouts, say [touching metal](https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss03/)
    can increase your risk of getting struck (another myth).

    on a tall ridge, your head is that high point (not ideal). But standing under
    a tall or solitary tree can sometimes be worse. That’s because direct strikes—instances
    where people get hit directly by a bolt—only account for 3 to 5 percent of all
    lightning-related injuries. But ground strikes—instances where people are shocked
    by electricity traveling through the ground—account for up to 50 percent of injuries.

- en: If you’re standing under a tree, you could be at potentially greater risk than
    if you were standing out in the open. That’s because lightning is more likely
    to hit a 100-foot-tall tree than a 5-foot-tall person. And if it does, the hiker
    beneath it is first in line for the aftershock.

- en: '“If lightning hits the tree, the ground current will go down through the tree
    and then back up through the ground,” Calhoun explains. If you’re far from the
    trunk, the electricity may have time to disperse before it gets to you. But if
    you’re right next to it, you’ll get the brunt of the shock. Calhoun’s recommendation:
    find a large patch of shorter trees of uniform height to stand under instead.'

    But, paradoxically, lying down puts you in even more danger than standing up.
    That’s because when you’re lying down, you maximize your contact with the ground.

    arm or neck—arcing through your heart along the way.
