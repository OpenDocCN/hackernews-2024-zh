    clinical trial, demonstrating that the true cost of developing a medicine may
    be far less than the billions of dollars claimed by the pharmaceutical industry.

    about the cost of trials, which has always been shrouded in secrecy. Its own bill
    for landmark trials of a four-drug combination treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis
    came to €34m (£29m).

- en: Current estimates for research and development of new medicines range from €40m
    to €3.9bn. The extortionate cost of trials is used to justify high prices of new
    medicines, but companies do not publish either the topline or a breakdown of their
    spending. MSF says this opacity should end. It has produced a toolkit for drug
    trialists, which categorises each item of expenditure and allows the costs to
    be collated throughout the process, which can last for years.

    innovation actually costs and building a future where access to medicines and
    medical tools is not hindered by high prices.”'

- en: The two antimicrobial drugs that have been the staple treatment for TB for decades,
    isoniazid and rifampicin, no longer work as well as they did. The outlook for
    patients with drug-resistant TB has been bleak in middle and low-income countries.
    Even if alternative drugs were available, they had to be taken regularly for an

    was developed by Johnson & Johnson and, in 2012, became the first TB drug to be
    approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US in 40 years. But the cost
    was [prohibitive for many of the worst-affected countries](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/29/victory-over-big-pharma-opens-door-to-cheaper-tuberculosis-drugs-india).
    It took a long battle by campaigners to [get the price reduced](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/18/cheaper-tb-drugs-for-millions-after-global-deal-on-patent-rights-agreed).
    The cost of R&D was a key factor. Eventually, it was revealed by academics that
    the drug was developed thanks to public funding, which was [five times more](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239118)
    than private investment.
