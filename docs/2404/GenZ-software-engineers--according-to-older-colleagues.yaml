    Gen X youth included a proliferation of musical genres with strong social-tribal
    identity such as alternative rock, hip hop, punk, post-punk, rave, and heavy metal.
    (...) Video games, both in amusement parlors and in devices in Western homes,
    were also a major part of juvenile entertainment for the first time. Politically,
    in many Eastern Bloc countries, Generation X experienced the last days of communism
    and the transition to capitalism as part of its youth. In much of the Western

    spend time ensuring graduate colleagues feel unafraid to speak up when senior
    peers are in the room. Indeed, companies like Meta [got rid of titles of seniority](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/54316453/standout-differences-between-facebook-and-other-big-tech-companies)
    in order to encourage precisely this behavior. But it’s always good to bear in
    mind the thin line between directness and rudeness.

    flexibility of work, mental health, and diversity. They are more protective of
    free time, but friendlier and more personal in the office than older colleagues.
    *Survey responses from GenZ tech workers confirm these observations.*
