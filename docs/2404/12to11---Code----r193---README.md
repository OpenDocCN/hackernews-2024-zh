This is a tool for running Wayland applications on an X server, preferably with a compositing manager running.   It is not yet complete.  What is not yet implemented includes support for touchscreens, and device switching in dmabuf feedback.   It is not portable to systems other than recent versions of GNU/Linux running the X.Org server 1.20 or later, and has not been tested on window (and compositing) managers other than GNOME Shell.   It will not work very well unless the compositing manager supports the EWMH frame synchronization protocol.   Building and running this tool requires the following X protocol extensions:   Nonrectangular Window Shape Extension, version 1.1 or later MIT Shared Memory Extension, version 1.2 or later X Resize, Rotate and Reflect Extension, version 1.4 or later X Synchronization Extension, version 1.0 or later X Rendering Extension, version 1.2 or later X Input Extension, version 2.3 or later Direct Rendering Interface 3, version 1.2 or later X Fixes Extension, version 1.5 or later X Presentation Extension, version 1.0 or later   In addition, it requires Xlib to be built with the XCB transport, and the XCB bindings for MIT-SHM and DRI3 to be available.   Sometimes, it might be desirable to build with EGL, and use OpenGL ES 2.0 for i.e. YUV video format support.  To do so, uncomment the block of code for EGL support in 12to11.conf before running `xmkmf'.  This will additionally require the EGL and GLESv2 development files, and for the following EGL and GLES extensions to be present at runtime:   EGL_EXT_platform_base EGL_EXT_device_query EGL_KHR_image_base EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import EGL_EXT_buffer_age   GL_OES_EGL_image GL_OES_EGL_image_external GL_EXT_read_format_bgra GL_EXT_unpack_subimage   After building with EGL support, the renderer must be enabled by setting the environment variable "RENDERER" to "egl", or by setting the "renderer" resource (class "Renderer") to "egl".   The following Wayland protocols are implemented to a more-or-less complete degree:   'wl_output',                                  version:  4 'wl_compositor',                              version:  5 'wl_shm',                                     version:  1 'xdg_wm_base',                                version:  5 'wl_subcompositor',                           version:  1 'wl_seat',                                    version:  8 'wl_data_device_manager',                     version:  3 'zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1',                        version:  4 'zwp_primary_selection_device_manager_v1',    version:  1 'wp_viewporter',                              version:  1 'zxdg_decoration_manager_v1',                 version:  1 'zwp_text_input_manager_v3',                  version:  1 'wp_single_pixel_buffer_manager_v1',          version:  1 'zwp_pointer_constraints_v1',                 version:  1 'zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1',            version:  1 'zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1',                version:  1 'xdg_activation_v1',                          version:  1 'wp_tearing_control_manager_v1',		version:  1   When built with EGL, the following Wayland protocol is also supported:   'zwp_linux_explicit_synchronization_v1',      version:  2   When the X server supports version 1.6 or later of the X Resize, Rotate and Reflect Extension, the following Wayland protocol is also supported:   'wp_drm_lease_device_v1',                     version: 1   When the X server supports version 2.4 or later of the X Input Extension, the following Wayland protocol is also supported:   'zwp_pointer_gestures_v1',                    version: 3   This directory is organized as follows:   Imakefile     - the top level Makefile template 12to11.conf   - configuration *.xml         - Wayland protocol definition source *.c, *.h      - C source code *.awk         - scripts used to generate headers *.txt         - text data used to generate some headers, i.e. those containing MIME types or shaders   Building the source code is simple, provided that you have the necessary libwayland-server library, pixman, XCB, DRM, xshmfence, and X extension libraries installed:   xmkmf # to generate the Makefile make  # to build the binary   wayland-scanner is also required when building from the repository.   Running the binary should be simple as well:   ./12to11   Wayland programs will then run as regular X windows.   Be sure to configure your system so that idle inhibition is reported correctly.  For more details, see the description of the idleInhibitCommand resource in the manual page.
