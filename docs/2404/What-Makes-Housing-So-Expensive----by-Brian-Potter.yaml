    these costs. Discussions of housing policy often focus on issues of zoning, regulation,
    and other supply restrictions which manifest as increased land prices, but for
    most American housing, the largest cost comes from building the physical structure
    itself. However, in dense urban areas — the places where building new housing
    is arguably most important — this changes, and high land prices driven by regulatory
    restrictions become the dominant factor.

    This survey is periodically sent out by the NAHB to several thousand home builders.
    It divides home building into several dozen separate activities (framing, plumbing
    fixtures, drywall, etc.) and asks home builders about their typical costs for
    each task. Note that while the survey is based on the average costs of thousands
    of different home builders, it does not represent the costs of an average home.
    Because every home builder gets equal weight in the survey, it overweighs the
    costs from boutique, luxury home builders (who might build just a few homes a
    year) and underweighs larger volume economy builders (who might build hundreds
    or thousands of homes a year). The “average” home cost given by the survey is
    almost $100,000 higher than the average home cost indicated by the Census. But
    while absolute costs won’t necessarily be representative, I expect the relative
    proportions devoted to each task to vary less between the low and high ends of
    the market (and we’ll do a bit of checking to be sure this is the case).

    of potential savings from accelerated construction, is fairly low, just 1.9% of
    the total cost of a new home. Depending on the technology chosen, speeding up
    construction might have surprisingly little impact on this. Prefabrication, for
    instance, can reduce on-site construction time, but using prefabrication often
    requires the fabricator to begin work months beforehand. If you need to make a

    luxury builders. The National Construction Estimator (whose estimates are roughly
    in line with Census cost data, and thus probably a good average) suggests a much
    more modest 5% builders profit. Sales commission is also on the higher side, though

    2,200 square feet, which at then-current median construction costs would cost
    $293,000 to replace. Using 1.1% annual depreciation (roughly the depreciation
    rate [used by the BEA](https://apps.bea.gov/national/pdf/BEA_depreciation_rates.pdf)
    for single family homes), and a median home age of 40 years, this gets us a median
    replacement value of around $188,000 for US homes. Per the Census, the median
    homeowner during that period [valued their home around $282,000](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/HSG495222#HSG495222).
    Taking into account that homeowners systematically overvalue their homes by around
    7%, this gives a median home value of around $262,000. This means that for the
    median US home, 72% of the value is from the structure itself, leaving 28% for
    the land. This is less than the Federal Reserve estimate of an average 40% land
    fraction nationally, but still higher than the roughly 20% value from new construction.
    So while for new housing, land is about 20-25% of the cost of a home, for existing
    housing this is closer to 30-40%.

  zh: 我们可以尝试用美国住房调查数据另一种方式计算。根据2021年的美国住房调查，美国独立单户家庭住宅的平均面积约为2,200平方英尺，按照当时的中位数建造成本，重建成本大约为29.3万美元。使用1.1%的年折旧率（大致上是由美国经济分析局用于单户家庭的折旧率），以及一个40年的中位房龄，这给我们带来了大约18.8万美元的中位重建价值。根据人口普查，那段时期的中位房主估计他们的房屋价值约为28.2万美元。考虑到房主系统性地高估自己的房屋约7%，这给出了大约26.2万美元的中位房屋价值。这意味着对于美国的中位数住宅，72%的价值来自结构本身，留下28%用于土地。这比联邦储备估计的全国平均土地分数低，但仍高于约20%的新建筑价值。因此，尽管对于新住房而言，土地约占房屋成本的20-25%，但对于现有住房而言，这接近30-40%。

- en: 'To understand what''s driving the high cost of land, we can divide the price
    of land into two separate buckets. The first is the “hedonic” value of the land,
    the value people get from being able to enjoy the space itself. The second is
    the “permission slip” — the right to build a certain amount of housing that comes
    attached to the plot of land. As we’ve [noted previously](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-much-do-construction-costs-matter),
    empirically people do not particularly value having additional land all that much.
    It’s the “permission slip” that makes up the majority of the value of most residential
    land parcels:'

  zh: 要理解土地高昂的驱动力，我们可以将土地价格分为两个独立的部分。首先是土地的“享乐”价值，即人们能从空间本身中获得的价值。其次是“建设许可证” —— 即附属于土地地块的建造一定数量住房的权利。正如我们之前提到的，实际上人们并不特别重视额外的土地。大部分住宅土地的价值主要来自“建设许可证”：

    in early 2000 (by analyzing home price sales and estimating how much a larger
    lot added to the home’s value), he found that in 16 of them, the hedonic value
    was less than (inflation adjusted) $1.50 per square foot, or less than $12,000
    dollars for the median lot size of ~8,000 square feet…By comparison, the median

    of new housing, it's a much larger proportion of the cost of existing housing.
    And in dense metro areas (the places that need housing the most), it can be even
    higher, exceeding 70% of the cost of a home. This high cost of land, in turn,
    isn’t because people value having lots of space for their kids to play on — it's
