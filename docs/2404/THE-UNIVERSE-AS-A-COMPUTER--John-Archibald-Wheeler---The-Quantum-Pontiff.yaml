- en: John Archibald Wheeler is a bit of a hero for me (and also, like all good heroes
    a bit of a villain). Discovering his paper “[It from Bit](https://philpapers.org/archive/WHEIPQ.pdf)”
    was definitely a huge inspiration for me to get into the field. When I found Wheeler’s
    paper it led me to Bill Wootters work, and I immediately charged my parents hundreds
    of dollars to get a copy of very paper Bill had written (I mean who wouldn’t want
    to read “[Quantum mechanics without probability amplitudes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01882696)“)
    Amusingly these days I think many who claim the mantle of “it from bit” have not
    actually read the paper, which is quite radical, you should definitely stop reading
    this blog and read the paper if you have not.

    (company plug) around the other day and found out the the American Philosophical
    Society has a [collection](https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/taxonomy/term/7420) with
    papers, notes, etc from Wheeler. Among these is a typed up note that I don’t think
    ever made it into a paper, but which I really loved. The title of the note is
    “THE UNIVERSE AS A COMPUTER”, and is dated “[1980?]”. In it Wheeler first lists
    possible meanings for the expression “the universe as a computer” followed by
    possible implications for this metaphor. And by list, I don’t mean a small list,
    he puts down 48 possible meanings. I love it.

    only intuitively, vaguely, partially, ambiguously, and abstractly by their authors
    and users. They are apt to be polysemous–possessed of  multiple and complex meanings,
    both relevant and irrelevant. Moreover, in the present instance the utilitarian
    and natural meaning of the very words universe and computer is unknown to an indefinite
    degree! Physicists who are trying to conceive a new cosmology based in part on
    the metaphor of the universe as a computer may find the following list clarifying,
    heuristic, provocative, useful for self-criticism or discussion, &c. It is a partial
    list that needs to be extended, systematized, edited, explained, and illuminated
    by examples and corollaries.'

    39\. “39\. No one knows how simple, powerful, universal, natural, and/or complex
    computers might ultimately become–and it might be in these  ultimate senses that
    the universe is or resembles a ‘computer’.  (It might even be possible to devise
    revolutionary types of computers by studying and applying computational or computer-like
    properties of the universe.) ” If this is truly 1980, this is pretty amazing because
    it is at its heart a statement that the universe’s computation may be very powerful,
    and that this might lead us to more powerful computers. This is right around the
    time Manin is credited with mentioning the idea of quantum computation in his
    book *Computable and Uncomputable* and before the 1981 Physics of Computation
    conference, which I think is [rightfully](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00410-6)
    considered a good point to take as the starting time for quantum computing.

    an uninterrupted process of change or of cosmoplastic or cosmopoietic interadjustments
    and interchanges” I mean come on this is awesome who writes like that these days?
    Wheeler’s writing was so full of this crazy poetry, that it famously got parodied
    in “[Rasputin, Science, and the Transmogrification of Destiny](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3fc6ea60833afcfdf83cd92eb94273bdfbec5153)”

    When we completed that work, Ben was able to attend a conference in honor of Wheeler,
    and I believe he told him about our work. I’m sad I never got to meet him, but
    I hope he could recognize in Ben talking with him, the long echo of his impact
    on those of us who still dream more about computation and the universe.
