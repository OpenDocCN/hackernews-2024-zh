    Agency (DARPA) claim to have achieved a breakthrough in machine learning by demonstrating
    that AI software can fly a modified F-16 fighter jet in a dogfight against human
    pilots.

    VISTA, a plane built as a testbed as it can mimic the performance of other aircraft,
    and recognition of their work as one of four finalists for the National Aeronautic
    Association's 2023 Robert J. Collier Trophy, an annual award for exceptional feats
    of aeronautics or astronautics in America.

    but the reality has remained a distant dream up until now," [said](https://www.edwards.af.mil/News/Article-View/Article/3744695/usaf-test-pilot-school-and-darpa-announce-breakthrough-in-aerospace-machine-lea/)
    Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. "In 2023, the X-62A broke one of the
    most significant barriers in combat aviation. This is a transformational moment,
    all made possible by breakthrough accomplishments."'

    years. Its [Air Combat Evolution (ACE)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/air-combat-evolution)
    program dates back to 2020, when [AlphaDogfight trials](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2020-08-26)
    pitted human pilots in a flight simulator [against an AI opponent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdhIA2S35w&t=16793s).

    at speeds that would have overstressed a real aircraft and generated g-forces
    that would harm a human pilot.

- en: Heuristic or rules-based autonomy has been a common approach in military and
    space applications. These sorts of expert systems boil down to if-then statements
    that specify condition-based triggers that lead to specific actions. But this
    approach is less useful when there are too many variables and rules to account
    for.

    informed decisions for both present and future situations, often discovering insights
    that are imperceptible to humans or challenging to express through conventional
    rule-based languages," [explained](https://youtu.be/C8yjtaZfNCw?feature=shared&t=55)
    Daniella Rus, director of MIT CSAIL, in a DARPA video you can see below. "Machine
    learning is extraordinarily powerful in environments and situations where conditions
    fluctuate dynamically making it difficult to establish clear and robust rules."'

- en: Dogfights between military aircraft are very much a dynamic scenario. But machine
    learning has a downside that needs to be overcome. It needs to be explainable
    and verifiable enough that military personnel will trust it and that aviation
    authorities will certify systems that implement such code.

    X-62A, a first for AI piloting. Testing and improvements continued over the next
    few months, until in September 2023, the AI software flew the X-62A in a mock
    dogfight against a human-piloted F-16\. It did so without violating human safety
    norms, and without leading the on-board pilots to intervene and take control.

    to AlphaGo Zero's impact on Chess, Shogi and Go, as a validation of autonomous
    aviation for both military and commercial applications.
