    of midlife, but something happened which hijacked my thought patterns. Just over
    a week ago I appeared at the Oxford Literary Festival; I gave a talk about *Hagitude*.
    Just one man sat, attentive, on the edge of the sea of women. After forty-five
    minutes during which I wove together a series of stories populated by the funny,
    feisty older women in European myth and folklore who I love so much, he asked
    a question: ‘What about the men?’'

    to answer. In my nonfiction I’ve always been scrupulous about writing within the
    realms of my own lived experience as a woman, and I hate it more than I can say
    when I read books or listen to talks and performances by men who tell and ‘interpret’
    women’s stories, and who are kind enough then to suggest to us ways in which our
    lives as women might be improved. I’ve never wanted to do the same to them. But
    this Oxford session wasn’t the first in which I’d been asked such a question,
    and by the time I’d driven north for four and a half hours along endless, soulless
    motorways to reach home the next day, I was beginning to wonder whether it might
    finally be time to make a stab at expressing a more thoughtful – and less evasive
    – response to it. It’s easy to say, *Well, if the men want their stories, let
    them go and find them* – but the knowledge of psychology, myth and folklore that
    I’ve acquired over the past several decades isn’t restricted to women, and it
    seems a pity to hold back information and ideas that might be useful.

    It’s about stripping the material that’s being alchemised back to the bone: back
    to its essential core. Men too can ask the question I posed in this context in

    in previous incarnations. And so Tuan mac Cairill was a recluse who retained his
    memories from previous incarnations, going back to before the Great Flood. Through
    a series of animal transformations (stag, boar and salmon) he survived into Christian

- en: In old Irish traditions, the King was associated not only with the land, but
    with society. During the reign of a king favoured by Sovereignty, the goddess
    of the land, the land would be fertile and prosperous and the tribe would be victorious
    in war. But if the king didn’t match up to the goddess’ expectations, he didn’t
    last long. And what she expected more than anything was that the king – and through
    his example, the people – would cherish the land. So it was that the ancient rites
    of kingship in Ireland included a ceremonial marriage, the *banais ríghi*, between
    the king and the land, and those rites lasted into the sixteenth century. In this
    sacred marriage, the king swore to uphold the land and his people and to be true
    to both; in return Sovereignty granted him the gifts which would help him to keep
    his oath.

  zh: 在古老的爱尔兰传统中，国王不仅与土地有关，还与社会有关。在一位得到主权女神青睐的国王统治期间，土地将会肥沃繁盛，部落在战争中也将获得胜利。但是，如果国王不能达到女神的期望，他的统治也不会长久。女神最期望的是国王，通过他的榜样作用，珍惜土地。因此，爱尔兰古代的王权仪式包括一场仪式化的婚姻，被称为*banais
    ríghi*，即国王与土地的婚姻，这些仪式一直延续到16世纪。在这种神圣的婚姻中，国王发誓要维护土地和人民，并对两者忠诚；而主权女神则赐予他能够帮助他信守誓言的礼物。

    declared that a king who is not just and true would cause the collapse of society.
    In this context, in some Arthurian romances we find the character of the Fisher
    King, whose physical wounding might cause the land to become a Wasteland: the
    body of the King is associated with the body of the land.'

    this is how they disrupt (and remember that disruption – by whatever means – is
    at the heart of the Trickster archetype). Male tricksters usually disrupt in other
    ways – through malicious pranks and other forms of classic trickery, for example
    – and are more likely to be malign (such as Loki in Norse myth, who caused the
    end of the world). Hermes is often considered to be a Trickster: he’s the inventor
    of lying and the patron of thieves. In Irish folklore the leprechaun was a Trickster,
    and several characters in English folklore, such as Robin Goodfellow.'

    Goodfellow）等几个角色也是如此。

    the Sage. In Jung’s individuation process, the archetype of the Wise Old Man emerged
    late in life; it was thought of as reflecting the Self. It has some commonality

- en: '** In 1956, Zürich-based analyst Toni Wolff, lover and colleague of Carl Jung,
    described what she believed to be four key female archetypes: the Mother, the
    Hetaira, the Amazon and the Medial Woman.  Wolff argued that although every woman
    has the potential to embody all of these four archetypes at various stages of
    her life, one or more of them tends to be of primary importance to each of us.
    The woman who is most identified with the Mother, for example, finds her primary
    identity and fulfilment in nourishing life – usually, but not necessarily, in
    bearing and raising children. The word hetaira refers to a class of highly educated
    women in ancient Greece who were trained not only to provide sexual services to
    men, but also to provide them with long-term companionship. And so the Hetaira
    woman, according to Wolff, finds her primary identity and fulfilment in relationships;
    in some senses, she might be thought of as a muse. The Amazon is a capable, resourceful
    woman who finds her primary identity and fulfilment in the outer world; she excels
    in work and skills that are usually perceived to be the domain of men. The Medial
    Woman, unlike the other three archetypes, doesn’t define herself in relation to
    others. Instead, she finds her primary identity and fulfilment in cultivating
    relationship with Jung’s ‘collective unconscious’ – which is similar in many ways
    to the place that in many older European traditions might be called the Otherworld
    – and acting as a bridge between it and the human community. Medial Women are
    visionaries, psychics, healers and poets. In some cultures, they might be priestesses
    or prophetesses, shamans or oracles.*'

  zh: '**1956年，苏黎世分析师托尼·沃尔夫（Toni Wolff），卡尔·荣格的情人和同事，描述了她认为的四种关键女性原型：母亲、海泰拉、亚马逊和中间女性。
    沃尔夫认为，虽然每个女人在生命的不同阶段都有可能体现这四种原型中的一种或多种，但其中一种或几种往往对我们每个人来说尤为重要。 例如，最认同母亲角色的女性，通常但不一定是通过生育和抚养子女，找到她的主要身份和满足感。
    海泰拉一词指的是古希腊的一类受过良好教育的女性，她们不仅受过专门培训以向男性提供性服务，还受过培训以长期陪伴他们。 因此，根据沃尔夫的说法，海泰拉女性在关系中找到她的主要身份和满足感；在某些意义上，她可能被认为是灵感的来源。
    亚马逊是一个能干、足智多谋的女性，在外部世界中找到她的主要身份和满足感；她擅长被通常被认为是男性领域的工作和技能。 不同于其他三种原型的中间女性不通过与他人的关系来定义自己。
    相反，她通过培养与荣格的“集体无意识”的关系来找到她的主要身份和满足感——在许多旧欧洲传统中，这个地方可能被称为其他世界——并充当它与人类社区之间的桥梁。
    中间女性是有远见的、心灵的、治疗师和诗人。 在某些文化中，她们可能是女祭司或先知、萨满或神谕。*'
