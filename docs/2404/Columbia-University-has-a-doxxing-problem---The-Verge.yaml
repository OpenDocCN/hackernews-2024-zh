    before last week’s protests. Shortly after Hamas’ October 7th attack on Israel,
    a box truck covered in LED screens displaying the names and photos of dozens of
    Columbia students started circling a pro-Palestine protest near the university’s
    Morningside Heights campus. The truck, paid for by the conservative nonprofit
    Accuracy in Media, called the students “Columbia’s Leading Antisemites.”

  zh: 当天晚些时候，大约晚上10点，Shafik宣布午夜前与学生达成协议，以“清理西草坪并恢复校园的平静”。在与哥伦比亚大学阿巴拉伯分离协议小组的学生代表进行谈判期间，Shafik威胁要召集国民警卫队和纽约市警察局。学生团体在一份声明中称，仍留在草坪上的几百名学生开始准备被逮捕。
- en: By Wednesday, the media circus was in full swing. As I spoke off the record
    with two members of the encampment whose faces were covered by sunglasses and
    scarves, a man approached us and asked why we weren’t in class; off to the side,
    I noticed provocateur and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. A few hours later,
    House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) [held a press conference](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/mike-johnson-columbia-national-guard-00154199)
    on the other side of the quad. “This is dangerous. This is not the First Amendment.
    This is not free expression,” Johnson said amid boos and chants of “Mike, you
    suck.” Then he urged President Joe Biden to call in the National Guard.

  zh: 到了周三，媒体狂欢达到了高潮。当我与两名帐篷营地成员进行非正式交谈时，他们的脸部被墨镜和围巾遮挡，一个男人走过来问我们为什么不上课；在一边，我注意到煽动者和“自豪男孩”创始人加文·麦金尼斯。几个小时后，众议院议长迈克·约翰逊（R-LA）
    [召开了新闻发布会](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/mike-johnson-columbia-national-guard-00154199)，在广场的另一侧。“这是危险的。这不是第一修正案。这不是自由表达，”约翰逊在嘘声和“迈克，你糟透了”的呼声中说道。然后他敦促乔·拜登总统调集国民警卫队。

    early Friday deadline was swiftly approaching. That night, Shafik said there would
    be no arrests. “There is a rumor that the NYPD has been invited to campus this
    evening,” she wrote in an email sent to students at 11:08PM. “This rumor is false.”

- en: For Sofia, an undergraduate student who declined to give her last name, the
    university’s willingness to facilitate the arrest of its own students in the first
    place suggests that Shafik’s concerns about safety are largely rhetorical. The
    arrests, she told me on Monday, are “in and of themselves a doxxing event, because
    all of that becomes public record.” After the first wave of arrests on April 18th,
    some publications, including the *New York Post*, published the full names and
    other identifying information of some students.

    of elected officials suggesting that an encampment full of undergraduates making
    signs at their crafts corner and hosting Passover seders amounts to a national
    security emergency, the students who find themselves in handcuffs and zip ties
    will end up with targets on their backs. According to [the NYPD’s own chief of
    patrol](https://hellgatenyc.com/columbia-minouche-shafik-nypd-gaza-solidarity-encampment),
    the students arrested on April 18th “were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever.”
    Reports suggesting that the students pose a danger to their classmates only serve
    to inflame the harassment they’ve been victims of for months.

  zh: 如果哥伦比亚在未来某个时候再次选择派遣纽约市警察局，经过一周的选举官员暗示，一个由本科生在他们的手工艺角落制作标语和主持逾越节聚餐的帐篷营地构成了国家安全紧急情况，那么发现自己被手铐和束缚带捆绑的学生将成为众矢之的。根据
    [纽约市警察局巡逻总监自己的说法](https://hellgatenyc.com/columbia-minouche-shafik-nypd-gaza-solidarity-encampment)，4月18日被逮捕的学生“和平，完全没有任何抵抗”。有报道称，这些学生对同学构成威胁，只会加剧他们几个月来遭受的骚扰。
- en: Dalia, the first-year student, lamented the outsize attention she and her peers
    have received compared to the war they’re protesting in the first place. “As Palestinians,
    as Arabs, we have been inherently at risk,” she said. “However, I also think that
    there really is no comparison to the horrors that are happening in Gaza, the horrors
    that are happening in Palestine. No amount of student repression — no amount of
    doxxing — can be equated to that.”
