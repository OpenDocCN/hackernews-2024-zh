- en: It’s been 10 years since tiny development studio ustwo games released *Monument
    Valley*, a game that presented a radically different approach to mobile gaming,
    created a genre and inspired independent studios and game design around the world.
    The studio is tucked away in a converted warehouse in South London.

    filled with oversized plants and colourful shelves scattered with the detritus
    of modern culture, from plastic toys to stacks of board games. The company employs
    around 45 people, with everything brought together on this site, from level and
    character design to coding, sound and internal testing.

- en: Danny Gray, ustwo games’s Chief Creative Officer, explains how the game originally
    got off the ground. ‘We were a tiny team, part of ustwo’s London design agency,’
    he recalls. The agency, founded by Matt Miller and John Sinclair in 2004, had
    started to branch out into the relatively new world of mobile gaming. Working
    with lead designer and game director [Ken Wong](https://www.instagram.com/kenwong.art),
    Gray and his skeleton team devised games that looked as if they came from a design
    agency, not a typical gaming background.

- en: Tasked with developing a showcase for the agency as well as an intriguing game,
    the concept came together relatively quickly. ‘We started off with reams and reams
    of concept art,’ says Gray, ‘it was all very audience-led – we’d pin it up on
    the walls of the studio and invite comments. It was an isometric drawing of architecture
    that got the most attention.’ Almost straight away, this image led to a prototype
    of a single-screen game where you had to guide a character from ‘point A to point
    B.’ One key gameplay mechanism, however, arose out of a graphical glitch; one
    of the sliding blocks appeared to move ‘impossibly’, instantly introducing the
    element of optical illusion and inviting new ways to navigate the on-screen world.

- en: As anyone who’s ever played the two *Monument Valley* games will know, each
    level is meticulously constructed. ‘From that idea to launch was took less than
    a year,’ says Gray, ‘Just six people made the game from beginning to end.’ The
    team was aiming for a modest total of 100,000 downloads, hoping to raise its profile
    – it was treated like a piece of marketing. The main energy went into carefully
    composing the levels. ‘It had to be all killer, no filler, with each level having
    its own core mechanism like a specific type of rotation,’ Gray explains, ‘we started
    with 30 levels and whittled it down to 10\. We were all about polish, not size.’

    the name wasn’t even considered until the very end. ‘Right before launch we were
    going to be interviewed by [*Edge* magazine](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/edge/)
    – the morning of that day we hadn’t picked the name.’ *Monument Valley* was chosen
    as being familiar, yet unusual, implying a sense of mystery, grandeur and travel.

    ball rolling – people wanted to know how it played,’ says Gray. A couple of rounds
    of beta testing opened the game up to swathes of influential people in the design
    and gaming industries. ‘It helped to position the game in a more highbrow way,’
    Gray says, ‘the impossible angles blew people away – it was like a form of street
    magic.’

    weren’t especially supportive [of the Android version] as it didn’t have any of
    the traditional gaming elements like in-app purchases,’ says Gray, ‘Apple saw
    the value straight away. They flagged up in the App store and even used it in
    their own marketing material.’

    hard on its references to Dutch master artist and printmaker Maurits Cornelis
    Escher, but also dug deep into classic video game design, going right back to
    early arcade machines and 8-bit titles. Each of the ten levels is like a piece
    of fine furniture, built with invisible dovetail joints and inlaid with marquetry,
    stuffed with secret compartments and little design flourishes. Gray cites the
    world of theatre and stage design, as well as graphics, as important keystones
    in the way the levels were constructed. ‘Ken would always talk about flower arranging,
    and how you frame a silhouette of a level on the screen,’ he says.

- en: Another aspect of *Monument Valley* that feels ahead of its time was its calm,
    mindful pace, buoyed by the lavish graphics and soothing music. Everyone from
    Brian Eno to Steve Reich influenced the sound of the finished product. ‘Myself
    and Ken ended up sitting down and drafting a Spotify playlist. We ended up using
    a track by Chicago-based musician [Obfusc](https://obfusc.bandcamp.com/) for the
    trailer, and that set the tone,’ says Gray, ‘there were also a lot of sound tests,
    where we gave the game to different sound designer and asked them to comp in ideas.’
    The end result, with music by [Todd Baker](https://www.soundcirclemusic.com/),
    is a minimal, ethereal and synthetic soundscape, where ‘every level is in effect
    an audio-visual toy.’

    expansion, *Forgotten Shores*, which added in some of the omitted levels. ‘It
    was basically a full game again, which was a bad business decision, but gave it
    a huge spike in popularity,’ says Gray. Awards followed, including recognition
    from BAFTA, Apple and D&AD, and it became a pop cultural staple, a rare crossover
    from the gaming world. ‘It was featured in Netflix’s *House of Cards* as a key
    plot device – this gave us a whole new audience,’ Gray recalls.

    160 million installs. Even though it’s been well over six years, *Monument Valley
    3* is now in an advanced stage of production. ‘It takes a long time for that well
    of creativity to be replenished,’ Gray admits, ‘it’s not the kind of game you
    can just do with 100 similar-looking levels.’ These days, ustwo games is a totally
    separate company to the Shoreditch-based design agency. A new development team
    is also bringing a new perspective. ‘We’re taking the original concept in surprising
    and different ways,’ says Gray, ‘I always thought MV1 was quite pure and MV2 was
    very narrative driven. MV3 will have the best of both worlds.’'

    something that can be replayed, rather than the very linear models of the first
    two games. Dynamic lighting is also on the cards, thanks largely to increases
    in the computing power of our mobile devices. As mentioned, *Monument Valley*
    simultaneously harked back to early computer graphics and fine art, yet it also
    introduced a clean, minimalist style that has proved incredibly influential, especially
    in the indie gaming sphere.

    as well as a rare example of pure creativity and innovation receiving due commercial
    reward. ‘These days there’s less diversity and innovation [in gaming],’ he muses,
    ‘Something can’t just make a bit of money, it has to make all the money. It’s
    the antithesis of creativity. We have to allow ourselves to work on the things
    that exist in the gaps of the algorithm. *Monument Valley* was a bet on ourselves,
    one that came back 100-hold. Hopefully *Monument Valley 3* will hark back to a
    time when we could take these kinds of risks and be innovative.’
