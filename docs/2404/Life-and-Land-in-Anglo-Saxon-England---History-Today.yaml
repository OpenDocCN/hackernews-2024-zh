- en: 'This is a quotation from an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poem, preserved in an 11th-century
    manuscript, which gives advice to an unknown reader on living a good and moral
    life. The poem’s outlook is expressly Christian, but here it uses a metaphor taken
    from the secular world: it imagines death as like being evicted, forced to leave
    your ‘temporary dwelling’ and settle in a new home at the will of an inscrutable
    landlord. The reader is reminded that their life on earth is like a house that
    does not belong to them, which they will have to leave one day.'
