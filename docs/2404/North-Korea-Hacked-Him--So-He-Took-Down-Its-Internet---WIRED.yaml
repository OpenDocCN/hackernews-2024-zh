- en: P4x says he has largely automated his attacks on the North Korean systems, periodically
    running scripts that enumerate which systems remain online and then launching
    exploits to take them down. “For me, this is like the size of a small-to-medium
    pentest,” P4x says, using the abbreviation for a “penetration test,” the sort
    of whitehat hacking he's carried out in the past to reveal vulnerabilities in
    a client's network. “It's pretty interesting how easy it was to actually have
    some effect in there.”

  zh: P4x称，他已经大部分自动化了对朝鲜系统的攻击，定期运行脚本来列举仍然在线的系统，然后发动攻击来关闭它们。“对我来说，这就像一次中小规模的渗透测试，”P4x说道，使用了“penetration
    test”的缩写，这种白帽黑客过去曾经在客户网络中揭示漏洞。“事实上很容易在那里产生一些影响，这是非常有趣的。”
- en: Those relatively simple hacking methods have had immediate effects. Records
    from the uptime-measuring service Pingdom show that at several points during P4x's
    hacking, almost every North Korean website was down. (Some of those that stayed
    up, like the news site Uriminzokkiri.com, are based outside the country.) Junade
    Ali, a cybersecurity researcher who monitors the North Korean internet, says he
    began to observe what appeared to be mysterious, mass-scale attacks on the country's
    internet starting two weeks ago and has since closely tracked the attacks without
    having any idea who was carrying them out.

  zh: 这些相对简单的黑客方法产生了立竿见影的效果。来自Pingdom的运行时间测量服务的记录显示，在P4x进行黑客攻击的几个时间点，几乎每个朝鲜网站都宕机了。（一些保持在线的网站，如新闻网站Uriminzokkiri.com，是基于国外的。）网络安全研究员朱纳德·阿里表示，他开始观察到似乎是对朝鲜互联网的神秘大规模攻击，从两周前开始，并且一直密切跟踪这些攻击，但并不知道是谁在进行这些攻击。
- en: Ali says he saw key routers for the country go down at times, taking with them
    not only access to the country's websites but also to its email and any other
    internet-based services. “As their routers fail, it would literally then be impossible
    for data to be routed into North Korea,” Ali says, describing the result as “effectively
    a total internet outage affecting the country.” (P4x notes that while his attacks
    at times disrupted all websites hosted in the country and access from abroad to
    any other internet services hosted there, they didn’t cut off North Koreans’ outbound
    access to the rest of the internet.)

  zh: 阿里说，他看到国家关键路由器在某些时候宕机，导致不仅国内网站的访问中断，还有电子邮件和其他基于互联网的服务。“随着他们的路由器崩溃，数据实际上是无法路由到朝鲜的，”阿里描述说，这个结果“实际上是影响整个国家的完全互联网断网”。（P4x指出，尽管他的攻击有时会中断该国托管的所有网站以及来自外部的其他互联网服务的访问，但并未切断朝鲜人对外互联网的出站访问。）
- en: As rare as it may be for a single pseudonymous hacker to cause an internet blackout
    on that scale, it's far from clear what real effects the attacks have had on the
    North Korean government. Only a tiny fraction of North Koreans have access to
    internet-connected systems to begin with, says Martyn Williams, a researcher for
    the Stimson Center think tank's North Korea-focused 38 North Project. The vast
    majority of residents are confined to the country's disconnected intranet. Williams
    says the dozens of sites P4x has repeatedly taken down are largely used for propaganda
    and other functions aimed at an international audience.

  zh: 尽管一个匿名黑客可能导致如此规模的互联网停机事件并不常见，但这些攻击对朝鲜政府产生了什么实际影响仍不清楚。斯蒂姆森中心智库北韩专注的38 North项目的研究员马丁·威廉姆斯表示，朝鲜只有极少数民众可以接触到互联网连接的系统。绝大多数居民被限制在该国的内部网络中。威廉姆斯称，P4x多次关闭的几十个网站主要用于对外宣传和其他旨在国际观众的功能。
- en: While knocking out those sites no doubt presents a nuisance to some regime officials,
    Williams points out that the hackers who targeted P4x last year—like almost all
    the country's hackers—are almost certainly based in other countries, such as China.
    “I would say, if he's going after those people, he's probably directing his attentions
    to the wrong place,” says Williams. “But if he just wants to annoy North Korea,
    then he is probably being annoying.”

  zh: 尽管毫无疑问，关闭这些网站对一些政权官员来说确实是一个讨厌的事情，但Williams指出，去年针对P4x的黑客——几乎所有该国的黑客——几乎肯定是来自其他国家，比如中国。Williams说：“我想说，如果他在追踪那些人，那他可能把注意力集中在了错误的地方。”
    “但如果他只是想激怒朝鲜，那他可能正在变得烦人。”
- en: For his part, P4x says he would count annoying the regime as a success, and
    that the vast majority of the country's population that lacks internet access
    was never his target. “I definitely wanted to affect the people as little as possible
    and the government as much as possible,” P4x says.

  zh: 他本人P4x表示，他认为激怒政权是成功的一部分，而那些没有互联网接入的国家绝大多数人并不是他的目标。P4x说：“我确实希望尽可能少地影响人民，尽可能多地影响政府。”
- en: He acknowledges that his attacks amount to no more than “tearing down government
    banners or defacing buildings,” as he puts it. But he also says that his hacking
    has so far focused on testing and probing to find vulnerabilities. He now intends
    to try actually hacking into North Korean systems, he says, to steal information
    and share it with experts. At the same time, he's hoping to recruit more hacktivists
    to his cause with a dark website he launched Monday called the FUNK Project—i.e.
    “FU North Korea”—in the hopes of generating more collective firepower.

  zh: 他承认他的攻击只不过是“拆除政府横幅或污损建筑物”，正如他所说的那样。但他也说，他的黑客攻击到目前为止主要集中在测试和探测漏洞。他现在打算尝试真正入侵朝鲜系统，他说，以窃取信息并与专家分享。与此同时，他希望通过他周一启动的一个名为FUNK
    Project的黑暗网站——即“FU North Korea”——招募更多的网络活动人士，以期望产生更多的集体火力。
