    tasks, aims to contribute to the development of the widely-used OpenStreetMap
    project through gamification. The team recently initiated the development of an
    iOS version of their popular Android app. According to their GitHub page, the
    contributors seek volunteers to familiarize themselves with the code and help
    develop the app.
