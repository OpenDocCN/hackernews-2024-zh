- en: Proposal [P0137R1](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0137r1.html)
    introduces a new function into the C++ standard library called `std::launder`.
    Unfortunately, this proposal is hard to understand for mere mortals.

- en: Here we first initialize `u` with `1` (so `x.n` is set to 1, and `x` becomes
    the active member of the union). Next, 5 is assigned to `u.f` and `f` becomes
    active. Finally, we do a placement new and overwrite `u` with the new value 2\.
    The problem here is that `n` is const-qualified and the optimizer is allowed to
    assume that it will always remain equal to 1\. So, `std::launder` acts as an optimization
    barrier that prevents the optimizer from performing constant propagation.

    a real-life use case in his talk “C++17 in Breadth” from CppCon 2016\. He tells
    us that this function might be handy when dealing with containers of const-qualified
    elements.

- en: 'This example defines a class hierarchy consisting of two classes: `A` and `B`.
    `A` defines a virtual member function `f` which is overridden in `B`. Function
    `f` in `A` does a placement new on the `this` pointer and replaces the object
    with a newly created instance of `B` and then returns 1\. `f` in `B` does the
    opposite, i.e. replaces the object with an instance of `A` and then returns 2.'

    Note that the second call is performed on the “laundered” pointer.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example resembles the first one, but this time the mutated const value
    is the `vptr` of `a` (i.e., a pointer to the vtable of either `A` or `B`). GCC
    has an optimization called “devirtualization”, i.e. the optimizer tries to figure
    out the dynamic type of each object in each virtual call and if the type is known,
    the compiler replaces such virtual call with a direct call. This time the optimizer
    is overly optimistic and fails to recognize that even stack-allocated objects
    can now change their dynamic type.

    This one has been spotted and a [fix](https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2016-10/msg00194.html)
    already exists.
