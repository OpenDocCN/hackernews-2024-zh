- en: Deborah Mannis-Gardner doesn’t rap or produce, but you’ll likely spy her on
    more album credits than all of the 808 mafias combined. One of America’s leading
    clearance agents, Deborah has spent 20 years dodging red tape to acquire music
    for film, samples and video games. Her role includes hunting obscure records,
    checking artists get their dough and putting the G-Funk in *Grand Theft Auto.*

    almost every other private jet gaucho. She fights for superstars as well as minor
    artists and is fervently against clearance becoming solely a millionaire’s game.
    Deborah’s vocal about protecting the culture of sampling and despite the thirsty
    trend of litigation, is yet to be taken to court. The feisty Jewish woman, who
    loves rap, discussed her favourite unreleased track, urban artists being unfairly
    sued, repercussions from the “Blurred Lines” lawsuit and getting Diddy on the
    phone with Enya.

    it stands at this moment. I went to clear something recently and because of our
    timeline, we chose to pull it rather than chase it. I went to clear a prominent,
    big selling artist for a sample, who has relations with him. They reached out
    to him and his people said “we like your song, but we’re still going to deny you.”

    sampling it, because my clients range from Eminem to Michael Jackson. I’ve dealt
    with very large artists, Rihanna, to small artists like when Macklemore was nobody.
    I try to make it really clear that it’s about the sample, what they’ve used, how
    they’ve used it and the final outcome of the new song. It should be irrelevant
    who sampled it, especially with what the quote is, so if Marshall [Eminem] sampled
    something, it shouldn’t be a higher quote because it’s going to make a lot of
    money or a lower quote because you want to cut him a break.

    quote should be based on the use of the sample and that’s really important. I
    think sampling is an art and I think it’s incredible. When I first started, I
    was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it
    wasn’t going to be around. All of that horrible, negative stuff. I kept saying
    “well, a collage, that’s not real art? Jambalaya isn’t real food?” That’s a great
    meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that’s what sampling is. Remember
    when there was like six or seven samples in a song and they used pieces of things
    like spice, adding little sounds to make something great? What about the fact
    that sampling took music and made it relevant again? It brought James Brown back
    to life. I don’t care what anyone says, it brought attention to artists that people
    didn’t even remember.

    being really drunk. You can find them on YouTube, doing "Don't Go Breaking My
    Heart," which I had cleared and then they didn't release. I think it was released
    on illegal mixtapes. That was brilliant. That was great, one of my favourites.
    I'm going to go listen to that.

    or interpolated something or you didn’t. I don’t believe there’s such a thing
    as having the same feel or similarity. Inspiration is not copyrightable. I mean
    if you think about it, The Beatles were influenced by Chuck Berry. The Rolling
    Stones were influenced by Muddy Waters, and let’s talk about Marvin Gaye. Who
    influenced Marvin Gaye? Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra. They even said that Marvin
    Gaye had the same style as Sam Cooke. So where do we take this? That’s the whole
    basis of music.

    appealing the decision, which they have the right [to do]. I find the whole thing
    ludicrous and wrong. I think that there are consequences from what the Marvin
    estate has done. There have been other people, like I saw a YouTube clip of Stevie
    Wonder even disagreeing with the position of the Marvin Gaye estate, and he doesn’t
    even allow his stuff to be sampled anymore. I’m very disappointed in the whole
    situation. I wasn’t happy with the people that spoke on behalf of the Marvin Gaye
    side. The fact that they sequestered and did not allow Dr. Ferrara’s musicology
    report to be reviewed. He’s the pre-eminent musicologist that everyone uses in
    the hip-hop community whenever anyone questions anything. He’s the person that
    the Gaye Estate hired and then they withdrew his report. So obviously he proved
    that Robin Thicke’s people must have been innocent, right?

    In the late 80s/early 90s, we were able to do buyouts when you paid a one time
    fee. You didn’t owe any other money. We’d get some pretty good deals. We would
    do a $500 buyout for a James Brown “hey, hey” on a Me Phi Me song. But that period
    ended when they were like “oh, I guess this genre is here to stay.”

    progression and if it’s rap music, you run out and clear it. But if you hear that
    same progression in an alternative rock song that you’re listening to on Sirius
    Radio, they are like “oh yeah, I guess it sounds like The Violent Femmes, but
    I’m definitely not going to put a claim in on that. “ That’s rock and roll, they
    all have those same kinds of feelings or chord progressions, but once you flip
    it to this genre of music, it’s a “claim.” I’ve always said that, I think it’s
    very unfair.

    unpolished, before it was mastered. There were like five to seven producers on
    each song and the uses of the samples and the mixing and everything they did,
    gave me complete goosebumps. I didn’t like as much the finished product, because
    it was a little bit polished. I guess I liked it a little bit rougher, but it
    was goosebumps just listening to “King Kunta” and all of that. Every aspect of
    that was a thrill and it had been a while since I had gotten a thrill listening
    to something.

    he called a friend of mine, who is the manager of this band, and when he called
    himself he didn’t even introduce himself as Puff. He introduced himself by saying
    [shy, quiet voice] “hi… this is Sean Combs, also known as Puffy.” That’s how he
    introduced himself. He was very respectful, very polite. There’s another side
