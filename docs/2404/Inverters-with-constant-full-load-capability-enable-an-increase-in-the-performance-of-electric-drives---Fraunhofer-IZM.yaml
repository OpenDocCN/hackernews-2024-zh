    elements, from being damaged by heat build-up, conventional systems throttle their
    maximum output in continuous operation. This process is also known as “derating”:
    Chips made of silicon carbide allow a smaller cooling surface while maintaining
    the same performance, which means that semiconductor material can be saved compared
    to silicon chips, as more optimum cooling is provided.'

    which are more efficient and more temperature-resistant than pure silicon. Two
    of these silicon carbide transistors are applied directly to a ceramic substrate
    at Fraunhofer IZM using an innovative prepackaging process. These prepackages
    can then be flexibly embedded in conventional PCBs. Thanks to the thin design
    and a reduction in the materials required, less mechanical stress and more uniform
    deformation behavior occurs in case of heat exposure. In addition, the segmented
    ceramic substrates make optimum use of the limited space available to best meet
    the specific requirements of the automotive industry.

    to cool the individual components more efficiently. The better the cooling effect,
    the less expensive semiconductor material is required, as the chips can be arranged
    even more compactly. The researchers'' aim is to achieve a high level of thermal
    integration of the various semiconductor elements, as well as passive components
    such as capacitors and copper conductors. For this purpose, the temperature-critical
    components are connected directly to the cooling system via silver sintered connections
    and thermally integrated in the best possible way: Thanks to a parallel arrangement,
    the cooling liquid reaches all heat sinks and connected semiconductor elements
    simultaneously, and the thermal energy is dissipated evenly. Copper is also being
    used for the first time in a 3D printing process to manufacture the cooling elements,
    allowing the excellent thermal conductivity of copper to be combined with the
    full flexibility of 3D printing, instead of only being able to access aluminum
    heat sinks as before. Compared to CNC milling processes, 3D printing allows a
    great deal of freedom with regard to the design of the cooling channel and, in
    turn, optimum utilization of the limited installation space.'

- en: '**In addition to advances in materials and production processes, the scientists
    were also able to achieve greater modularity of the individual elements for the
    prototype. While the concept envisaged in the previous project was still based
    on a solution in which all components were permanently connected to each other,
    the elements of the inverter can now be replaced and repaired more easily as sub-modules.
    As a result, electric vehicles can be produced even more resource-efficiently
    and can also be operated longer. Especially in a resource-critical industry such
    as the automotive industry, low material costs are an important factor in being
    able to manage the energy transition cost-effectively.'

    and will ultimately undergo an extensive testing process at Porsche AG in order
    to one day find its way into series production. The Dauerpower project was successfully
    launched in 2021 and received funding of EUR 1.2 million from the German Federal
    Ministry of Economics under the reference number 19I21023C. In addition to Fraunhofer
    IZM, other project partners include Porsche AG and Robert Bosch GmbH.****
