    was the first big social-media IPO since Snap went public in 2017\. Reddit [closed

    开始了商业化探索，并努力成为互联网不只是前端的平台。
- en: And it’s not just the business of the site that’s changing. We’ve discovered
    that the nature of what goes viral on the platform has also shifted dramatically
    in just the past few months — in seemingly good ways. The most popular posts on
    Reddit have switched from reposted content from “karma farmers,” or engagement
    hackers, to nearly entirely original content from less popular Reddit users. Original
    content from smaller communities is now outperforming recycled evergreen content
    by a tremendous margin across the platform. As of October, none of the top five
    posts of the month on r/all were original. By March of this year, four out of
    five of these posts were original.

    Reddit 用户的原创内容。来自较小社区的原创内容现在在整个平台上都比重复的常青内容表现出色得多。截至十月，r/all 本月的前五名帖子中没有一篇是原创的。但到今年三月，其中四篇是原创内容。

    were happening organically, possibly because of a new post index system they’re
    testing out, which keeps feeds like r/all updated with fresher content. The increased
    number of upvotes, however, tell a different story. But to understand what’s changed
    and how, we first have to dig into how Reddit has functioned for the majority
    of its pre-IPO life.

    Reddit 在其 IPO 前大部分时间的运作方式。
- en: The best way to think about Reddit is as a nesting doll of smaller and smaller
    communities, or subreddits. You might follow a couple of them for a hobby — r/crochet
    has 1.1M members — or your favorite TV show — r/SVU has 62,000 — and never see
    the larger platform. These different communities can set their own rules, appoint
    moderators, and avoid dealing with everyone on the site as a single mass. Reddit’s
    IPO put a [huge spotlight](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/reddit-ipo-public-content-moderation.html)
    on how important these members, who are unpaid, are for maintaining the site —
    the company [gave](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/tech/reddit-ipo-users-can-buy-shares/index.html)
    long-time users stock.

  zh: 最好的方法是将 Reddit 看作是一组越来越小的社区或子社区的嵌套娃娃。您可能会追随一些以爱好为主题的社区 — 如 r/crochet 有 110 万成员
    — 或您最喜欢的电视节目 — 如 r/SVU 有 62,000 名成员 — 并且永远不会看到更大的平台。这些不同的社区可以制定自己的规则，任命管理员，并避免将整个站点的每个人视为一个单一的群体。Reddit
    的 IPO 使得这些长期未获报酬的成员对于维护网站的重要性成为焦点 — 该公司 [向他们赠送了](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/26/tech/reddit-ipo-users-can-buy-shares/index.html)
    股票。
- en: The content within subreddits is organized by a score redditors call “karma.”
    And in theory a post’s karma is the number of upvotes it receives minus the number
    of downvotes it receives within a certain amount of time. But in practice, attempts
    to artificially inflate karma are popular enough — both from people wanting attention
    on their posts and spammers who want to use the posts for marketing — that Reddit
    uses a variety of ways to control and obscure the numbers. A [2016 Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13862042/reddit-upvote-downvote-scoring-system-recalculation)mentions
    the last publicly announced change to the karma system before the website [closed
    its open-source repositories](https://betanews.com/2017/09/04/reddit-open-source-changes/)
    in 2017.

    karma 的尝试非常流行 — 无论是想在他们的帖子上引起注意的人，还是想要利用帖子进行营销的垃圾邮件发送者 — 以至于 Reddit 使用了各种方式来控制和模糊这些数字。一篇
    [2016 年的 Verge 文章](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13862042/reddit-upvote-downvote-scoring-system-recalculation)

- en: Reddit’s front page, r/all, is a list of posts with the most upvotes, or biggest
    karma, across every subreddit all at once. Which makes r/all a contentious feature
    among Reddit’s users, since a post from a smaller community reaching the top can
    attract a flood of new, uninformed voices to the subreddit. But r/all is also
    effectively the most important real estate on the site. Years ago, a link getting
    to the top of r/all would be referred to as the “[hug of death](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2jfelz/what_is_the_reddit_hug_of_death/),”
    because it would bring so much traffic to your website that it could crash.

    r/all 也实际上是该网站上最重要的地产。多年前，一个链接达到 r/all 的顶部曾被称为“[死亡拥抱](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2jfelz/what_is_the_reddit_hug_of_death/)”，因为它会给您的网站带来如此多的流量，以至于可能会导致崩溃。

    over the years, though, and up until recently, r/all was almost entirely populated
    by big, established subreddits like r/MadeMeSmile or r/facepalm. And usually the
    posts coming from these subreddits are low-hanging videos or screenshots taken
    from other platforms weeks or even years after they were originally created. The
    term for this kind of engagement hack is “karma farming,” or worse, “karma whoring.”
