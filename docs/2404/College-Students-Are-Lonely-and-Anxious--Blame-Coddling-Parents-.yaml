    that today''s college students are so lonely, sad, and socially anxious that they
    grab their dining hall food to go—preferring to eat in their rooms.'

    a college data company. Attendance at sporting events, clubs, and even dorm meetings
    is down too. The *Journal* quotes one residential adviser who said several students
    asked to attend her meeting by Zoom, even though they were down the hall.

    The changes include less class participation and more students handing in half-finished
    assignments. These same students are then shocked when they get Fs. They tell
    their professors: *Look, I tried.*'

    granular examples of a generation that seems to have arrived on campus undercooked.
    The authors found that at Wesleyan University, student government meetings used
    to begin with a walk around campus. Today, they still take a walk, but they hold
    onto a shared rope, preschool style.

    in seven students has considered suicide this past year, according to a Healthy
    Minds study cited by the *Journal*. In fact, so many students are demanding therapy
    that hundreds of colleges have contracted with a telehealth company that promises
    to find students a therapist within five minutes of their call.

    potential culprits: COVID-19 closures, political extremism, and even the advent
    of the "like" button. But could one unnoticed factor be the fact that this generation
    spent so little time unsupervised as kids?'

    found that the majority of parents of kids ages 9 to 11 will not let them walk
    to a friend's house, play at the park with a friend, or trick-or-treat unchaperoned.
    Only half will let their kids go to another aisle at the store by themselves.

    the neighborhood, or even drift over to the dairy section without anxious adults
    watching and assisting them…might just be unprepared for the real world—or even
    eating in the dining hall.

    I'm not talking about TikTok. I'm talking about the fact that nowadays when a
    kid's bike chain falls off, they can [instantly call Dad to come fix it](https://www.wsj.com/articles/raising-a-free-range-child-in-2020-try-a-smartwatch-11593509401).
    It's the same thing with their grades; teachers tell me kids are texting their
    parents from the school bathroom. The parents then turn around and call the school.

    skills: creativity, communication, compromise, compassion, and leadership. When
    they successfully complete tasks on their own, they understand that they are helpful,

    expand, they will arrive on campus unprepared—clinging to the rope like a toddler,
    because that's how they have been treated all their lives.
