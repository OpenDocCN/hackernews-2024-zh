    to be due to a haywire immune system that attacks the digestive tract—in my case,
    the end of the small bowel. Every Crohn’s patient experiences different symptoms.
    Some have daily mild belly aches and unruly diarrhea. I’ve always experienced
    near-normal health punctuated by periods of wild pain, nausea, and weight loss.
    The most common treatments are steroids, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant
    drugs, and, as a last resort, surgery to remove any bowel beyond repair. In my
    thirties, the combination of fresh inflammation and scar tissue from a teenage
    surgery had blocked up my bowel. Eating became like gambling—sometimes I won,
    but mostly I lost.

- en: It was Stanley Dudrick, a strong-minded surgical resident at the University
    of Pennsylvania, who would change that. One weekend in November 1961, Dudrick
    was left to look after three surgical patients. The patients had had different
    procedures, but over the weekend, all three died. Having watched his supervisor,
    Dr. Rhoads, a revered surgeon, perform technically flawless surgeries on each
    of them, Dudrick concluded their deaths were his fault. When he told Rhoads on
    Monday, he was assured the patients were all frail from their operations, and
    their gastrointestinal tracts were struggling to absorb enough nutrients to overcome
    the weakness. The patients didn’t die from his ineptitude—they died of malnutrition.

  zh: 是强有力的宾夕法尼亚大学外科住院医生 Stanley Dudrick 改变了这一切。1961 年 11 月的一个周末，Dudrick 独自照顾了三位外科患者。这些患者接受了不同的手术，但整个周末，这三人都去世了。在观察他的主管、备受尊敬的外科医生
    Rhoads 对每位患者进行技术上无懈可击的手术后，Dudrick 得出结论，他们的死是他的错。周一他告诉 Rhoads 时，后者告诉他，患者们都因手术而虚弱，他们的消化道无法吸收足够的营养以克服这种虚弱。患者们不是死于他的无能，而是死于营养不良。
- en: A fire was lit in Dudrick. He requested leave from his surgical internship and
    worked out of a small lab in the hospital’s basement, determined to find a solution.
    For years, he honed the composition for a nutrition formula that could be delivered
    via veins, avoiding the intestines. By the late ’60s, he had finally found a stable
    mixture of water, carbohydrates, proteins, trace elements, fats, salts, and multivitamins—everything
    you need from a balanced meal, just with the color and smell of Elmer’s glue.

  zh: 在Dudrick心中燃起了一团火。他请求离开外科实习，并在医院地下室的一个小实验室里工作，决心找到解决办法。多年来，他不断调整营养配方的成分，希望能够通过静脉输送，避开肠道。到了60年代末，他终于找到了一种稳定的混合物，包括水、碳水化合物、蛋白质、微量元素、脂肪、盐和多种维生素——这些组成了一个均衡饮食所需的一切，只是看上去和闻起来像艾尔默胶水一样。
- en: But the concentrated nutrients did burn. “I’ve actually put it in my own vein,”
    Dudrick told Dr. Rhoads, showing his forearm. “It burns like liquid fire.” To
    banish the blaze, he knew the formula would have to be injected close to the heart,
    to allow for fast dilution around the body. When he kept a beagle named Stinky
    alive, nourished only with the nutrient combination infused into his vena cava
    (a large vein that returns deoxygenated blood to the heart), Dudrick was convinced
    it would work for humans. He’d invented TPN. Since then, it has saved millions
    of lives.

    into an IV bag, prime the pump, and flush the PICC with saline. She explained
    the buttons and the beeps on the pump that squirted the mixture through the tubes

    in the brain by the vagus nerve, contributing to the feeling of fullness. Hormonal
    signals also act on the brain: leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, sends
    signals to the hypothalamus to inhibit hunger. In patients on TPN or enteral nutrition,

    a spittoon to spit out chicken like a confused cowboy wasn’t going to accomplish
    either. But now I begrudgingly admit she was on to something. Chewing food, even
    without swallowing, helps to activate the cephalic phase, triggering a partial
    sense of satiation. The doctor never explained this to me.

- en: Paul Smeets, a nutritional neuroscientist at the University Medical Center Utrecht
    in the Netherlands, told me that part of the problem is that patients on enteral
    and parenteral nutrition receive the infusion over such a long period. “They sneak
    nutrition into people so slowly that the brain is never aware it’s happening,”
    he told me. The homeostatic feedback produced from eating a meal, that allows
    the brain to feel satisfied, is missing. TPN and enteral nutrition are, in effect,
    a form of sensory deprivation. My hunger was a natural neurological reaction that
    could be traced back for millennia.

    a good day looked like. She ended up eating less. Family members of patients on
    artificial nutrition often feel guilty about eating, some even lose weight, I
    learned. This unearthly relationship with food wasn’t what I wanted to offer her,

    her concern. In the late ’70s, doctors learned that patients on TPN often experience
    several stages of adaptation, including grief—mourning the loss of food rather
    than the death of someone close. Watching cooking shows seemed like a form of
    remembering and searching for what I had lost. When I tried to stop, I felt like
    I was from a different planet, separate from everyone else whose lives swirled
    around food. When watching cooking shows, I could fake being human. Since the
    cephalic phase of digestion begins at the sight of food, even before putting a
    crumb in one’s mouth, it’s also possible I was subconsciously attempting to veer
    onto an ancient road to satiety even if, for me, it didn’t lead anywhere.

    *Will you starve so that others will be better fed?* The 36 participants were
    underfed until they lost 25% of their body weight. As the experiment progressed,
    Ancel Keys, the nutritionist running the study, noticed odd psychological effects.
    The participants became increasingly focused on food, collecting recipes, and
    taking down pin-ups of women to hang pictures of food. One even decided he would
