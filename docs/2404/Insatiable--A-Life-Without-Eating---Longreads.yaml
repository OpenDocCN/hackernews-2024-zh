    to be due to a haywire immune system that attacks the digestive tract—in my case,
    the end of the small bowel. Every Crohn’s patient experiences different symptoms.
    Some have daily mild belly aches and unruly diarrhea. I’ve always experienced
    near-normal health punctuated by periods of wild pain, nausea, and weight loss.
    The most common treatments are steroids, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant
    drugs, and, as a last resort, surgery to remove any bowel beyond repair. In my
    thirties, the combination of fresh inflammation and scar tissue from a teenage
    surgery had blocked up my bowel. Eating became like gambling—sometimes I won,
    but mostly I lost.

    I wouldn’t get enough calories through regular eating, put me on a nutritional
    therapy called enteral nutrition—an infusion of milky formula into the belly.
    I had to snake a flexible rubber tube up my nose and into my stomach every night,
    tearing it out in a rush before school in the morning. The tube would sometimes
    disconnect from the IV bag while I was sleeping, the pump whirring away until
    morning. I’d wake up drenched in sticky formula with an empty stomach.

    and JELL-O. But, without that shackle of a tube, I would not have stayed alive

    and formulas directly into the stomach either through a tube placed into the nose
    and down into the stomach, like mine, or through an incision in the belly. However,
    enteral nutrition relies on patients having a working digestive system. Doctors
    thought it was impossible to bypass the digestive tract and get enough nutrition
    into patients through a vein, believing it required so much liquid, and such a
    high concentration of chemical nutrients, that it would cause inflammation and
    burning when administered.

- en: It was Stanley Dudrick, a strong-minded surgical resident at the University
    of Pennsylvania, who would change that. One weekend in November 1961, Dudrick
    was left to look after three surgical patients. The patients had had different
    procedures, but over the weekend, all three died. Having watched his supervisor,
    Dr. Rhoads, a revered surgeon, perform technically flawless surgeries on each
    of them, Dudrick concluded their deaths were his fault. When he told Rhoads on
    Monday, he was assured the patients were all frail from their operations, and
    their gastrointestinal tracts were struggling to absorb enough nutrients to overcome
    the weakness. The patients didn’t die from his ineptitude—they died of malnutrition.

    worked out of a small lab in the hospital’s basement, determined to find a solution.
    For years, he honed the composition for a nutrition formula that could be delivered
    via veins, avoiding the intestines. By the late ’60s, he had finally found a stable
    mixture of water, carbohydrates, proteins, trace elements, fats, salts, and multivitamins—everything
    you need from a balanced meal, just with the color and smell of Elmer’s glue.

    Dudrick told Dr. Rhoads, showing his forearm. “It burns like liquid fire.” To
    banish the blaze, he knew the formula would have to be injected close to the heart,
    to allow for fast dilution around the body. When he kept a beagle named Stinky
    alive, nourished only with the nutrient combination infused into his vena cava
    (a large vein that returns deoxygenated blood to the heart), Dudrick was convinced
    it would work for humans. He’d invented TPN. Since then, it has saved millions
    of lives.

    that hold cells together start to break down, and the tissue softens. When that
    happens, tissues can merge, forming a little tunnel known as a fistula. A CT scan
    showed that my bowel had formed several fistulas looping on themselves—the path
    of digestion more a maze than a hallway.

    into an IV bag, prime the pump, and flush the PICC with saline. She explained

    Like many thirty-something married couples in San Francisco, Erica and I lived
    with five other tirelessly social roommates. One ran a start-up from the living
    room. The house was often standing room only. And what did people do when they
    hung around in groups? They cooked and they drank. Early on in the flare-up, the
    group shared a rich and earthy-tasting homemade coq au vin. I helped to meticulously

    alert. My body, on the other hand, looked and felt like wet cardboard. The anxiety
    of hunger settled under my ribs like the feeling you get when you’re about to
    burst into tears. The hum of the refrigerator alone was enough to make me want
    to bury my head in the backyard. I often dreamt of donuts, and once, of my sister-in-law’s
    mother, a tenacious Serbian woman, bringing me a roasting pan full of sausages.
    By the time I had my first dose of TPN, I had gone without eating for nearly a
    week and a half, sustained only by fluids in the hospital. Then, due to a holiday
    and clerical error, I was left on a dose half of what I required—intended to see
    how well I handled the slurry—for a week longer than expected. I assumed the hunger
    would subside with enough nutrition. But even after weeks on full TPN, I still
    could’ve eaten the plastic bags it came in.

    flung into oblivion.

    is consumed and broken down during digestion. In return, the body adapts nutritious
    molecules into a host of cellular processes and adenosine triphosphate, or ATP,
    which cells turn into energy. During digestion, physiological responses are triggered
    in the brain by the vagus nerve, contributing to the feeling of fullness. Hormonal
    signals also act on the brain: leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, sends
    signals to the hypothalamus to inhibit hunger. In patients on TPN or enteral nutrition,
    leptin does increase after infusions, but it doesn’t appear to be well correlated
    with decreased hunger.'

    to be important to feeling satisfied. Monkeys on TPN continued to [eat real food](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/98652/)

    those injected with only lactated Ringer’s, a solution designed to replenish electrolytes
    and fluid rather than calories. I asked an on-call gastroenterologist once what

    either. But now I begrudgingly admit she was on to something. Chewing food, even
    without swallowing, helps to activate the cephalic phase, triggering a partial

- en: Paul Smeets, a nutritional neuroscientist at the University Medical Center Utrecht
    in the Netherlands, told me that part of the problem is that patients on enteral
    and parenteral nutrition receive the infusion over such a long period. “They sneak
    nutrition into people so slowly that the brain is never aware it’s happening,”
    he told me. The homeostatic feedback produced from eating a meal, that allows
    the brain to feel satisfied, is missing. TPN and enteral nutrition are, in effect,
    a form of sensory deprivation. My hunger was a natural neurological reaction that
    could be traced back for millennia.

    southern Italy, and we’d lie on the bed. Erica would ask if I farted out my penis
    that day. I’d say not today, and then we’d laugh at the ridiculousness of what
    a good day looked like. She ended up eating less. Family members of patients on
    artificial nutrition often feel guilty about eating, some even lose weight, I
    learned. This unearthly relationship with food wasn’t what I wanted to offer her,
    but it was what I served, like pulling out a burnt tray of hors d’oeuvres just

    her concern. In the late ’70s, doctors learned that patients on TPN often experience
    several stages of adaptation, including grief—mourning the loss of food rather
    than the death of someone close. Watching cooking shows seemed like a form of
    remembering and searching for what I had lost. When I tried to stop, I felt like
    I was from a different planet, separate from everyone else whose lives swirled
    around food. When watching cooking shows, I could fake being human. Since the
    cephalic phase of digestion begins at the sight of food, even before putting a
    crumb in one’s mouth, it’s also possible I was subconsciously attempting to veer
    onto an ancient road to satiety even if, for me, it didn’t lead anywhere.

    effects seen in people who are physically deprived of food. In 1944, 36 men entered
    a study after seeing a brochure passed out at the University of Minnesota asking,
    *Will you starve so that others will be better fed?* The 36 participants were
    underfed until they lost 25% of their body weight. As the experiment progressed,
    Ancel Keys, the nutritionist running the study, noticed odd psychological effects.
    The participants became increasingly focused on food, collecting recipes, and
    taking down pin-ups of women to hang pictures of food. One even decided he would
    change careers and become a chef. After the study, most participants gorged themselves
    long after their weight returned to normal.

    of patients report being constantly tired; up to one-third have anxiety; one quarter
    are clinically depressed.

    I was craving when I was on TPN: black pepper crabs, pecan waffles, meat pies,
    Turkish delight, and, of course, roast chicken. I have no memory of how I came
    to want these particular foods. Instead, I remember all the ways my body told
    me something was wrong. But the hunger, the sense of loss, and the search for
    connection in cooking shows were a perfectly normal response, as it turns out.
    Maybe as close to the human experience as you can get.'

    over the city’s tallest building, the newly built Salesforce Tower. Erica bounced
    as she told me the surgeon had performed a masterful operation. He removed only
    six inches of bowel and fixed the bladder. The surgery rescued me from any more
    TPN in the immediate future while nudging me ever so slightly closer to a future
    without food—again, relief and suffering at the same time.

    the Salesforce Tower out the window. “It looks like a giant penis.”
