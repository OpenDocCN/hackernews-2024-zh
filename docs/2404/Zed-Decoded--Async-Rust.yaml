    Decoded I'm going to take a close look at Zed — how it's built, which data structures
    it uses, which technologies and techniques, what features it has, which bugs we
    ran into. The best part? I won't do this alone, but get to interview and ask my
    colleagues here at Zed about everything I want to know.

    how Zed uses async Rust — in Zed. It's a loose conversation that focuses on the

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One remarkable thing about async Rust is that it allows you to choose your own
    runtime. That's different from a lot of other languages (such as JavaScript) in
    which you can also write asynchronous code. Runtime isn't a term with very sharp
    definition, but for our purposes here, we can say that a runtime is the thing
    that runs your asynchronous code and provides you with utilities such as `.spawn`
    and something like an `Executor`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most popular of these runtimes is probably [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).
    But there's also [smol](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol), [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy)
    and others. Choosing and switching runtimes comes with tradeoffs, they [are only
    interchangable to a degree](https://corrode.dev/blog/async/), but it is possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Zed for macOS, as it turns out, we don't use any one of these. We also don't
    use `async_task`'s `Executor`. But there has to be something to execute the asynchronous
    code, right? Otherwise I wouldn't be typing these lines in Zed.

    and a `Task`, and asks the `dispatcher` to run it on the main thread.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `dispatcher` here is a `PlatformDispatcher`. That's the GPUI equivalent
    of `async_task`'s `Executor` from above. It has `Platform` in its name because
    it has different implementations for macOS, Linux, and Windows. But in this post,
    we're only going to look at macOS, since that's our best-supported platform at
    the moment and Linux/Windows implementations are still work-in-progress.

    it as a handle to a `Task` — into a raw pointer and passes it to `dispatch_async_f`

  prefs: []

    pops it off the queue, and calls `trampoline`, which takes the raw pointer, turns
    it back into a `Runnable` and, to poll the `Future` behind its `Task`, calls `.run()`
    on it.

- en: In a native UI application, the main thread is important. No, the main thread
    is *holy*. The main thread is where the rendering happens, where user input is
    handled, where the operating system communicates with the application. The main
    thread should never, ever block. On the main thread, the responsiveness of your
    app lives or dies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's true for [Cocoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)) applications
    on macOS too. Rendering, receiving user input, communication with macOS, and other
    platform concerns have to happen on the main thread. And since Zed wants perfect
    cooperation with macOS to ensure high-performance and responsiveness, it does
    two things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, it uses GCD to schedule its work — on and off the main thread — so that
    macOS can maintain high responsiveness and overall system efficiency.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the importance of the main thread is baked into GPUI, the UI framework,
    by explicitly making the distinction between the `ForegroundExecutor` and the
    `BackgroundExecutor`, both of which we saw above.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a writer of application-level Zed code, you should always be mindful of what
    happens on the main thread and never put too much blocking work on it. If you
    were to put, say, a blocking `sleep(10ms)` on the main thread, rendering the UI
    now has to wait for that `sleep()` to finish, which means that rendering the next
    frame would take longer than 8ms — the maximum frame time available if you want
    to achieve [120 FPS](https://zed.dev/blog/120fps). You'd "drop a frame", as they
    say.

    background, since `.lock()` might block. It''s unlikely that there will be contention
    for this lock in this particular code path, but if there was contention, it wouldn''t
    freeze the UI, only a single background thread. That''s the pattern: if it''s
