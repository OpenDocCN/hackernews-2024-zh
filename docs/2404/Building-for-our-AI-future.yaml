    was nice to see the recognition of our leading AI tools and infrastructure, and
    all the ways our customers are using them. Excited to show more progress during
    our earnings call next Thursday. Today, I want to share some changes we’re making
    across the company to simplify decisions and help us work better and faster.

    structure and improve velocity and execution — such as bringing together the Brain
    team in Google Research with teams in DeepMind, which helped accelerate our Gemini
    models; unifying our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster
    decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience; and bringing
    our Search teams under one leader.

    focus on building models across Research and Google DeepMind. All of this work
    will now sit in Google DeepMind and scale our capacity to deliver capable AI for
    our users, partners and customers. This will simplify development by concentrating
    compute-intensive model building in one place and establishing single access points
    for PAs looking to take these models and build generative AI applications.

    investing in foundational and applied computer science research in three key areas
    that tie directly to Google’s mission: computing systems (including quantum),
    foundational ML and algorithms, and applied science and society. Fundamental computer
    science research is in our DNA and we have some of the world''s best computer
    scientists. We simply would not be the company we are today without the researchers
    who developed the foundations on which all Google’s products are built and are
    now inventing the foundations for our future.'

    software and AI. So we are formalizing the collaboration between DSPA and P&E
    and bringing the teams together in a new PA called Platforms & Devices. And the
    Google Research teams focused on computational photography and on-device intelligence
    will also be moving over to join the new org to bring deep AI expertise across
    platforms and devices.

    across Alphabet. This includes piloting a new role as executive sponsor of Japan.

    a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and
    not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe,
