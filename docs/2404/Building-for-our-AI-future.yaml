- en: We’re coming off an amazing Cloud Next — congrats again to all involved. It
    was nice to see the recognition of our leading AI tools and infrastructure, and
    all the ways our customers are using them. Excited to show more progress during
    our earnings call next Thursday. Today, I want to share some changes we’re making
    across the company to simplify decisions and help us work better and faster.

    2\. Responsible AI; 3\. Platforms and Devices; and 4\. Mission First. It''s a
    long note, but I want you to see the full rationale.'

    structure and improve velocity and execution — such as bringing together the Brain
    team in Google Research with teams in DeepMind, which helped accelerate our Gemini
    models; unifying our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster
    decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience; and bringing
    our Search teams under one leader.

- en: Now, to accelerate this progress, we’re going to consolidate the teams that
    focus on building models across Research and Google DeepMind. All of this work
    will now sit in Google DeepMind and scale our capacity to deliver capable AI for
    our users, partners and customers. This will simplify development by concentrating
    compute-intensive model building in one place and establishing single access points
    for PAs looking to take these models and build generative AI applications.

    investing in foundational and applied computer science research in three key areas
    that tie directly to Google’s mission: computing systems (including quantum),
    foundational ML and algorithms, and applied science and society. Fundamental computer
    science research is in our DNA and we have some of the world''s best computer
    scientists. We simply would not be the company we are today without the researchers
    who developed the foundations on which all Google’s products are built and are
    now inventing the foundations for our future.'

    Google Research with Yossi as the dedicated leader reporting to him. James and
    Demis will keep working as closely as they always have, and Google DeepMind and

    software and AI. So we are formalizing the collaboration between DSPA and P&E
    and bringing the teams together in a new PA called Platforms & Devices. And the
    Google Research teams focused on computational photography and on-device intelligence
    will also be moving over to join the new org to bring deep AI expertise across
    platforms and devices.

    quality products and experiences for our users and partners. It will help us turbocharge
    the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bring the best innovations to partners
    faster — as we did with Circle to Search with Samsung. And internally, it will
    also speed up decision-making.

    ecosystem. Hiroshi, who has done so much to grow Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, G1
    and Photos, will advise on the transition even as he starts work on some new projects
    across Alphabet. This includes piloting a new role as executive sponsor of Japan.
    Hiroshi and I have been discussing these changes for many months, and I’m excited
    to see him lead across a new set of challenges.

    enables a vibrant ecosystem of manufacturers, carriers, silicon makers like Qualcomm,
    and hundreds of thousands of developers who use the platform to compete in the
    global market. On top of that, our Pixel family of devices has been growing well,
    and helps to spur innovation — and accelerate the adoption of the latest Android

    greater focus and clarity towards our mission. However, we also need to be more
    focused in *how* we work, collaborate, discuss and even disagree. We have a culture
    of vibrant, open discussion that enables us to create amazing products and turn
    great ideas into action. That''s important to preserve. But ultimately we are
    a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and
    not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe,
    to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive
    issues or debate politics. This is too important a moment as a company for us
    to be distracted.'
