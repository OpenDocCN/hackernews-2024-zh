- en: Today, the Moscow District Military Court began hearing the case against Andy
    Stone—the spokesman for the U.S. technology giant *Meta* that owns *Facebook,
    WhatsApp* and *Instagram*—in absentia. Stone is accused of “justifying terrorism.”
    He was placed under arrest in absentia in Russia last November and [put](https://zona.media/news/2023/11/26/meta)
    on the federal wanted list.

    Judge Roman Kiforenko on the absence of *Meta’s* press secretary in the courtroom.
    The defendant’s lawyer, Valentina Filippenkova, insisted that her client had not
    been properly notified about the start of the proceedings. She requested to postpone
    the hearing, but the judge seemed irritated from the very beginning and not inclined
    to delay the case.

    prosecutors in Russia. The 67-year-old Loktionov has participated in many high-profile
    trials: 10 years ago, he represented the prosecution in the trial of the members
    of the [Combat Organisation of Russian Nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Organization_of_Russian_Nationalists#:~:text=The%20Battle%20Organization%20of%20Russian,group%20based%20out%20of%20Moscow.);

    (Young Shakro); and in 2020, in the trial against [Karina Tsurkan](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2930OB/),

    (the FSB accused him of treason, Safronov received 22 years). After the start
    of the war, politician [Vladimir Kara-Murza](https://en.zona.media/article/2022/12/30/postcards)
    was also accused of treason, and the court sentenced him to 25 years—with Boris
    Loktionov again as the prosecutor in the trial. For his participation in the Kara-Murza
    case, the prosecutor was sanctioned by the United Kingdom.

    He posted it on March 11, 2022, during the early stages of the invasion of Ukraine,
    after *Meta* decided not to block users calling for the “death of Russian invaders”
    and Vladimir Putin. The company insisted that the new moderation rules only applied
    to posts about “Russian invaders,” not civilians.

    in Russia; *WhatsApp* is not blocked to this day.

    actual criminal articles. Initially, the case against Stone was opened under three
    articles: calls for terrorist activity, public calls for extremist activity, and
    public justification of terrorism. In the end, the charges were limited to only
    the last article, but the indictment still contained wording about calls for terrorism
    and extremism.'

    initially insisted on questioning Timoshev in court, but Judge Kiforenko demanded
    an explanation of the point in waiting for this witness.
