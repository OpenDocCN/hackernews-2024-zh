    — a craft flying much closer to the [sun](https://mashable.com/article/solar-flares-sun-active-why)
    than any previous mission — witnessed massive "vortex-like structures" in our
    star's outer atmosphere, called the corona. You can see the unprecedented view
    below, taken by the probe's WISPR camera (short for Wide-field Imager for Parker
    Solar Probe) and recently posted online.

    (CME) — when the sun ejects a mass of super hot gas (plasma) into [space](https://mashable.com/category/space)
    — interacting with the solar wind. The sun's solar wind is constant, as our [medium-sized
    star](https://mashable.com/article/how-hot-is-sun-nasa) emits a steady stream
    of charged particles.

    Journal*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad2208 "(opens
    in a new window)"), concluded that this find in uncharted realms of the sun has
    created new opportunities to better understand and predict CMEs, outbursts that
    can severely harm communications and electrical grids on [Earth](https://mashable.com/article/earth-pictures-images-from-space).
    Technically, these rare vortices are called "Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,"
    or KHI.

- en: CMEs "can endanger satellites, disrupt communications and navigation technologies,
    and even knock out power grids on Earth," [NASA](https://mashable.com/category/nasa)
    explains. Infamously, a potent CME in 1989 knocked out power to millions in Québec,
    Canada. The CME hit Earth's magnetic field on March 12 of that year, and then,
    wrote NASA astronomer Sten Odenwald, "Just after 2:44 a.m. on March 13, the currents
    found a weakness in the electrical power grid of Québec. In less than two minutes,
    the entire Québec power grid lost power. During the 12-hour blackout that followed,
    millions of people suddenly found themselves in dark office buildings and underground
    pedestrian tunnels, and in stalled elevators."

    To withstand the heat, it's fortified with a 4.5-inch-thick carbon heat shield
    that's pointed at the sun. The shield itself heats up to some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit,
    but just a couple of feet behind the shield, the environs are surprisingly mild.
