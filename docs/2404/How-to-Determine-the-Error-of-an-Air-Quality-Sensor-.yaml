    It describes how far a sensor measurement deviates from the true value. For instance,
    if a temperature sensor has an average error of 2°C and measures 15°C, the real
    temperature lies probably somewhere between 13°C and 17°C. The lower the average
    error, the better the sensor performance. There are two parameters that are often
    used to quantify this: the Mean Absolute Error and the Root Mean Square Error.
    The following article will explain both parameters using illustrative examples.'

    cancel each other out, resulting in a very small error (0.2 µg/m³) which would

    differences, i.e., we convert all negative differences to positive values, we
    end up with an average error (MAE) of 9 µg/m³ which reflects reality much better.

    the RMSE, both sensors have pretty much the same error. Yet, you would probably
    go for the right sensor, true? That’s because this one has a lower relative error.

- en: Have a closer look at the pollution levels the two sensors in Figure 4 are exposed
    to. The particulate matter (PM) concentrations on the right are 10 times higher
    than on the left. An RMSE (see lower panels) of ca. 7 µg/m³ has a much larger
    impact on the measurements in the less polluted environment. If we just looked
    at the RMSE, we would be misled to think that both sensors perform equally well.
    Here is where the nRMSE comes into play. It is useful for comparing the performance
    of sensors across environments with different pollution levels. It’s less useful
    for temperature and humidity sensors.

- en: The nRMSE is calculated by normalizing the RMSE, that means by dividing it by
    the average (true) measurement value during the testing interval. In our example,
    this would be the average PM concentration that was measured while the sensor
    was tested. In the bottom of Figure 4 you can see the calculation of the nRMSE
    for the polluted and less polluted environment. The sensor in the less polluted
    environment has an nRMSE of 66%, indicating that its measurements were on average
    66% off the true concentration. The sensor in the polluted environment was on
    average wrong by 6%. So, relatively speaking, the right sensor is more accurate
    than the left one.

    air quality measurements. When operated correctly, they are more reliable and
    accurate than low-cost sensors. However, it’s important to acknowledge that all
    measurements entail a degree of uncertainty. Low-cost sensors have many other
    advantages over reference-grade instruments e.g. their small size, easy setup
    and maintenance, and their low costs of course. To be able to benefit from these
    advantages, a slightly lower accuracy is tolerated.
