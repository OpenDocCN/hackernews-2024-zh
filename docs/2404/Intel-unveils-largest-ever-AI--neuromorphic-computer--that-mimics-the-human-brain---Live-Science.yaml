- en: The machine, dubbed "Hala Point," can perform AI workloads 50 times faster and
    use 100 times less energy than conventional computing systems that use central
    processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), Intel representatives
    said in a [statement](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-builds-worlds-largest-neuromorphic-system.html#gs.84tuhb).
    These figures are based on findings uploaded March 18 to the preprint server [IEEE
    Explore,](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448003) which have not been peer-reviewed.

    architecture and computer science.

    computers process data differently from supercomputers, so it's hard to compare
    them. But Trinity, the [38th most powerful](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/list/2023/11/)
    supercomputer in the world boasts approximately 20 petaFLOPS of power — where
    a FLOP is a floating-point operation per second. The [world's most powerful supercomputer](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/top-7-most-powerful-supercomputers-in-the-world-right-now)
    is Frontier, which boasts a performance of 1.2 exaFLOPS, or 1,194 petaFLOPS.

    signals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9313413/#:~:text=In%20SNNs%2C%20such%20as%20in,and%20work%20in%20continuous%20time.)
    — is fed into the spiking neural networks (SNNs), represented by the processors.
    Where software-based neural networks are a collection of machine learning algorithms
    arranged to mimic the human brain, SNNs are a physical embodiment of how that
    information is transmitted. It allows for parallel processing and spike outputs
    are measured following calculations.

    different nodes are connected and information is processed at different layers,
    similar to neurons in the brain. The chips also integrate memory and computing
    power in one place. In conventional computers, processing power and memory are
    separated; this creates a bottleneck as data must physically travel between these
    components. Both of these enable parallel processing and reduce power consumption.

    for AI workloads of 15 trillion operations per watt (TOPS/W). Most conventional
