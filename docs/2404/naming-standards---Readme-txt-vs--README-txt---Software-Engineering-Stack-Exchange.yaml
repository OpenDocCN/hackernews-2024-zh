    sense because it is probably the first thing a new user would want to look at.
    (Or, at least, *should* have looked at…) As others have already said, file names
    starting with a capital letter will be listed before lower-case names in [ASCIIbetical](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ASCIIbetical-order.html)
    sorting (`LC_COLLATE=C`) which helps make the file visible at a first glance.

- en: The `README` file is part of a bunch of files a user of a free software package
    would normally expect to find. Others are `INSTALL` (instructions for building
    and installing the software), `AUTHORS` (list of contributors), `COPYING` (license
    text), `HACKING` (how to get started for contributing, maybe including a TODO
    list of starting points), `NEWS` (recent changes) or `ChangeLog` (mostly redundant
    with version control systems).

    should follow this convention unless there are compelling reasons for a deviation.
    In the UNIX world, file name extensions were traditionally used sparingly so the
    canonical name of the file is `README` without any suffix. But most users probably
    would have no troubles understanding that a file named `README.txt` has the same
    meaning. If the file is written in [*Markdown*](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
    a file name like `README.md` might also be reasonable. Avoid using more complicated
    markup languages like HTML in the `README` file, however, because it should be
    convenient to read on a text-only terminal. You can point users to the manual
    of the software or its on-line documentation, that might be written in a more
    sophisticated format, for details from the `README` file.
