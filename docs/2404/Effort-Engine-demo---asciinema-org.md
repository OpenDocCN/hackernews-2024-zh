While this site doesn't provide GIF conversion at the moment, you can still do it yourself with the help of asciinema GIF generator utility - [agg](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/agg/).

Once you have it installed, generate a GIF with the following command:

```
agg https://asciinema.org/a/654503 demo.gif
```

Or, if you already downloaded the recording file:

```
agg demo.cast demo.gif
```

Check `agg --help` for all available options. You can change font family and size, select color theme, adjust speed and more.

See [agg manual](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/agg/usage/) for full usage instructions.
