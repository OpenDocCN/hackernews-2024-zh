- en: The FAA's concerns regarding launching without re-entry authorization stem from
    public safety and an acknowledgment that the reentry vehicle will eventually return
    to Earth once launched. Its mission might be constrained by propellant, component
    failure, or some other factor, but unless its orbit can be raised high enough
    for it not to be a concern, it will inevitably re-enter at some point.
