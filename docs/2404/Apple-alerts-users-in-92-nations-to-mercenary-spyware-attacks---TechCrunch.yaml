    is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,”
    it wrote in the warning to affected customers.

    what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting
    such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,”
    Apple added in the text.

    in India in October last year. Later, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International
    [reported](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/india-pressed-apple-on-state-sponsored-warnings-report-says/)
    that it had found Israeli spyware maker NSO Group’s invasive spyware Pegasus on
    the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. (Users in India are among those
    who have received Apple’s latest threat notifications, according to people familiar
    with the matter.)

    In recent months, many tech firms have cautioned about rising state-sponsored
    efforts to sway certain electoral outcomes. Apple’s alerts, however, did not remark
    on their timing.

    this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior
    to evade detection in the future,” Apple told affected customers.

    notifications are high-confidence alerts that a user has been individually targeted
