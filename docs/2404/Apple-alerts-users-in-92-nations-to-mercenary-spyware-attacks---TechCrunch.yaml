    in India in October last year. Later, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International
    [reported](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/india-pressed-apple-on-state-sponsored-warnings-report-says/)
    that it had found Israeli spyware maker NSO Group’s invasive spyware Pegasus on
    the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. (Users in India are among those
    who have received Apple’s latest threat notifications, according to people familiar
    with the matter.)

    In recent months, many tech firms have cautioned about rising state-sponsored
    efforts to sway certain electoral outcomes. Apple’s alerts, however, did not remark
    on their timing.
