    suffering. It can ruin lives. Even with the best treatments available, symptoms
    and suffering often continue. [An article that two colleagues and I just published
    April 6, 2019 in the medical journal *Schizophrenia Research*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996419301136?via%3Dihub)
    describes two patients with longstanding schizophrenia who experienced complete
    remission of symptoms with the [ketogenic diet](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ketogenic-diet
    "Psychology Today looks at ketogenic diet"), a well-established, evidence-based
    treatment for epilepsy. Of particular interest in our research, both patients
    were able to stop antipsychotic medications and have remained in remission for
    years now. Though more evidence is certainly needed, this is extraordinarily hopeful
    news for those with this disorder and for the mental health professionals treating
    them.

    disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bipolar-disorder "Psychology
    Today looks at bipolar disorder"), affects 2 to 5 percent of the population. Tens
    of millions of people suffer. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and
    disorganized thought and speech patterns. Hallucinations are when people see things
    or hear things that aren’t there, while delusions are thoughts that aren’t true,
    such as paranoid beliefs. Many people describe these psychotic symptoms as “being
    out of touch with reality.” People diagnosed with schizophrenia may also ignore
    hygiene, avoid being around people, and lack [motivation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation

    and can severely impair people at school, work, and in relationships.

    think it involves a ***chemical imbalance***. This refers to neurotransmitters
    in the brain—chemicals that send messages from one brain cell to another. This
    theory has largely focused on excess activity of a neurotransmitter called [dopamine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dopamine
    "Psychology Today looks at dopamine")—primarily because all antipsychotic medications
    block dopamine receptors. While there is a lot of evidence to support the dopamine
    theory, many current treatments designed around it have come up short. The treatments
    appear to only affect some of the symptoms, not all of them, and don’t change
    the course of the illness itself.

    There is evidence that the brains of people with schizophrenia are different than

    A common debate in the field is whether the antipsychotic medications, which are
    known to cause weight gain and diabetes, are to blame. Recent research suggests
    that this is not the entire explanation. Even [people newly diagnosed with schizophrenia
    appear to already have insulin resistance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720402),
    even though most don’t yet have diabetes. This means that their brains may not
    be getting enough energy from glucose. [Other brain studies have found metabolic
    abnormalities,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216857/) such as

    because neurologists have been trying to figure out how it works in epilepsy.
    This diet is known to produce ketones which are used as a fuel source in place
    of glucose. This may help to provide fuel to insulin resistant brain cells. This
    diet is also known to affect a number of neurotransmitters and ion channels in
    the brain, improve metabolism, and decrease inflammation. So there is existing
    science to support why this diet might help schizophrenia.

    her medications “cold turkey.” This sent her into severe psychosis requiring an
    extended hospitalization. In the hospital, she was re-medicated with Haldol-decanoate
    (an injectable medication which had not worked for her previously) and she continued
    the ketogenic diet. Within a month on both Haldol and the ketogenic diet, she
    reported complete remission of her psychotic symptoms for the first time since
    she was 14\. Over the following year, she slowly tapered off Haldol, and remained
    free of psychotic symptoms. Of note, she lost 70 pounds from the diet, which exacerbated
    her anorexia. She has since regained 30 of those pounds and maintains a healthy
    weight today. Five years after starting the ketogenic diet, she is off all antipsychotic
    medications, remains on the diet, and is free of all psychotic symptoms. She has
    also finished graduate school and now works full time.
