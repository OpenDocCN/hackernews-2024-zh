    suffering. It can ruin lives. Even with the best treatments available, symptoms
    and suffering often continue. [An article that two colleagues and I just published
    April 6, 2019 in the medical journal *Schizophrenia Research*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996419301136?via%3Dihub)
    describes two patients with longstanding schizophrenia who experienced complete
    remission of symptoms with the [ketogenic diet](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ketogenic-diet
    "Psychology Today looks at ketogenic diet"), a well-established, evidence-based
    treatment for epilepsy. Of particular interest in our research, both patients
    were able to stop antipsychotic medications and have remained in remission for
    years now. Though more evidence is certainly needed, this is extraordinarily hopeful
    news for those with this disorder and for the mental health professionals treating
    them.

    disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bipolar-disorder "Psychology
    Today looks at bipolar disorder"), affects 2 to 5 percent of the population. Tens
    of millions of people suffer. Symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and
    disorganized thought and speech patterns. Hallucinations are when people see things
    or hear things that aren’t there, while delusions are thoughts that aren’t true,
    such as paranoid beliefs. Many people describe these psychotic symptoms as “being
    out of touch with reality.” People diagnosed with schizophrenia may also ignore
    hygiene, avoid being around people, and lack [motivation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivation

    think it involves a ***chemical imbalance***. This refers to neurotransmitters

    theory has largely focused on excess activity of a neurotransmitter called [dopamine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dopamine

    block dopamine receptors. While there is a lot of evidence to support the dopamine
    theory, many current treatments designed around it have come up short. The treatments

    normalizing impaired prepulse inhibition in mice—yet another marker commonly associated
    with schizophrenia. The mice on the ketogenic diet appeared normal on this measure.
    Interestingly, weight loss was a factor for which they controlled in designing
    the study. Some of the mice were calorie restricted and others were not. They
    concluded that weight loss was not required to get the benefit of the ketogenic
    diet—the diet alone was enough.

- en: The two women described in the *Schizophrenia Research* article above, who are
    currently in complete remission from schizophrenia, probably do not care why this
    diet worked. The proof is in the pudding for them. But we doctors like to know
    more about how and why things work, and better understand how many more people
    might respond to this type of treatment. Clearly, more research is needed. However,
    make no mistake. All of these research findings, from the basic science of schizophrenia
    to the case reports and studies mentioned here, open up a new field of inquiry—one
    based on entirely novel mechanisms of action and a whole new way of understanding
    schizophrenia. I, for one, am hopeful for the millions of people suffering. The
    sooner we can offer more effective treatments, the better.

- en: If you have schizophrenia or any serious disorder and are considering using
    the ketogenic diet as a treatment, I strongly recommend that you consult with
    a healthcare professional before trying this diet. Why? Because mental illnesses
    are serious disorders and sometimes dangerous. The medical version of the ketogenic
    diet has risks and side effects. You should have accurate information, help, and
    medical supervision to implement treatments in a safe and effective way. All of
    the patients described in all of these studies were treated by physicians while
    attempting the ketogenic diet.

    contemplating the ketogenic diet as a treatment for illness of any kind is urged
    to seek medical help from a competent medical provider trained in treatment of
    the underlying condition as well as the ketogenic diet therapy before initiating
    the ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet induces significant metabolic changes which
    can impact medication metabolism, among other things. Individuals seeking treatment
    of any illness using the ketogenic diet will likely require additional support
    especially during the initial adaptation phase, and thereafter for the duration
    of treatment which can take years depending on a variety of factors. No doctor-patient
    relationship is created by this article, or by any responses to comments posted
