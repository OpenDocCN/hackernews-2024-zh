- en: The github repos have moved to a new RsyncProject organization. Because various
    life events have been monopolizing my time, I reached out to Tridge [Andrew Tridgell]
    (the original author) and he has graciously agreed to get back into rsync work,
    along with Paul Mackerras, who was also an early contributor to rsync. This new
    team will be working mainly on maintenance tasks, and not so much on new features.
    If you want to get involved, feel free to reach out on the new discord RsyncProject
    channels.
