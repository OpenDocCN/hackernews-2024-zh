    and will keep producing nuts until they start falling off the tree. The global
    growth in demand has prompted farmers across the Central Valley to blanket the
    countryside with these distinctive, white-blossomed trees. Today, around 1.4 million

    Almond pollination occurs in January and February when the hives’ bees are at
    the groggiest and weakest points in their lifecycle; they must be spurred into
    shape by a procession of treatments and feeds. The bees are loaded onto trucks
    to make their prolonged journeys to the Central Valley, in some cases traveling
