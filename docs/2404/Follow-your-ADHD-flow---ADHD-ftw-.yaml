    it.

    Today, we’re going to talk about how you might use that second brain differently
    depending on what your current ADHD state is.

    most frequently.

    Understanding what my current *state of being* is, and choosing tasks for the
    day that align with it, helps me live a more happy, healthy, and fulfilling life
    with less stress.

    phenomenal amount done! This is the state in which I tend to do my best deep work.

- en: I was in hyperfocus mode when I created [all of my courses](https://gomakethings.com/courses/),
    [Reef JS](https://reefjs.com), and various other projects. At my last job, I got
    three months of coding done in about three weeks during an intense period of hyperfocus.

    (as in *not* the task you *need* to be doing).
  prefs: []

    just start working, and only open up my second brain to add things I don’t want
    to forget later, like a piece of digital scrap paper.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I’m in this state, I can usually knock a ton of small-to-mid-sized tasks
    off my todo list. These are the kinds of things that my brain would find annoying
    during a period of hyperfocus, but require little thought and let me go into a
    place a rote zen.

  prefs: []

    spent. You’re too fuzzy in the brain to hyperfocus, but too physically tired to
    do anything else.
