### Instructions:

Initially, the Northern hemisphere is shown on the left and the Southern hemisphere is shown on the right.
Click anywhere on the Northern hemisphere and that point will become the central point on the left.
Or, click anywhere on the Southern hemisphere and that point will become the central point on the right.
Click on the *Spin/Pause* to start a dynamic rotation of the two disks.
If you want to click on a different location, click *Reset* to start over.

Note: What is shown here are the two sides of a flat disk. To make the disk, just set the backgound to "light", print this page, fold the paper so that the disk are front/back to each other, tape them, and then cut out the disk.
