    has now been excited for the first time with lasers. This paves the way for revolutionary
    high precision technologies, including nuclear clocks.

    scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state
    of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications.
    It could be used, for example, to build an nuclear clock that could measure time
    more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used
    to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics - for example, the question
    of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change
    in space and time.'

    its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use
    a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely
    track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two
    areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: classical quantum
    physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development
    of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten
    Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team
    from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal "Physical
    Review Letters".'

    of the laser is chosen exactly right, atoms or molecules can be switched from
    one state to another. In this way, the energies of atoms or molecules can be measured
    very precisely. Many precision measurement techniques are based on this, such
    as today''s atomic clocks, but also chemical analysis methods. Lasers are also
    often used in quantum computers to store information in atoms or molecules.'

    atomic nuclei. "Atomic nuclei can also switch between different quantum states.
    However, it usually takes much more energy to change an atomic nucleus from one
    state to another – at least a thousand times the energy of electrons in an atom
    or a molecule," says Thorsten Schumm. "This is why normally atomic nuclei cannot
    be manipulated with lasers. The energy of the photons is simply not enough."

    objects for precision measurements: They are much smaller than atoms and molecules
    and are therefore much less susceptible to external disturbances, such as electromagnetic
    fields. In principle, they would therefore allow measurements with unprecedented
    accuracy.'

- en: Since the 1970s, there has been speculation that there might be a special atomic
    nucleus which, unlike other nuclei, could perhaps be manipulated with a laser,
    namely thorium-229\. This nucleus has two very closely adjacent energy states
    – so closely adjacent that a laser should in principle be sufficient to change
    the state of the atomic nucleus.

    of this transition. "The problem is that you have to know the energy of the transition
    extremely precisely in order to be able to induce the transition with a laser
    beam," says Thorsten Schumm. "Knowing the energy of this transition to within
    one electron volt is of little use, if you have to hit the right energy with a
    precision of one millionth of an electron volt in order to detect the transition.”
    It is like looking for a needle in a haystack – or trying to find a small treasure
    chest buried on a kilometer-long island.

- en: Some research groups have tried to study thorium nuclei by holding them individually
    in place in electromagnetic traps. However, Thorsten Schumm and his team chose
    a completely different technique. "We developed crystals in which large numbers
    of thorium atoms are incorporated," explains Fabian Schaden, who developed the
    crystals in Vienna and measured them together with the PTB team. "Although this
    is technically quite complex, it has the advantage that we can not only study
    individual thorium nuclei in this way but can hit approximately ten to the power
    of seventeen thorium nuclei simultaneously with the laser – about a million times
    more than there are stars in our galaxy." The large number of thorium nuclei amplifies
    the effect, shortens the required measurement time and increases the probability
    of actually finding the energy transition.

    the thorium transition was hit exactly, the thorium nuclei delivered a clear signal
    for the first time. The laser beam had actually switched their state. After careful
    examination and evaluation of the data, the result has now been published.'

    had focused his research entirely on the search for the thorium transition. His
    group as well as competing teams from all over the world have repeatedly achieved
    important partial successes in recent years. "Of course we are delighted that
    we are now the ones who can present the crucial breakthrough: The first targeted
    laser excitation of an atomic nucleus," says Schumm.'

    how to excite the thorium state, this technology can be used for precision measurements.
    "From the very beginning, building an atomic clock was an important long-term
    goal," says Thorsten Schumm. "Similar to how a pendulum clock uses the swinging
    of the pendulum as a timer, the oscillation of the light that excites the thorium
    transition could be used as a timer for a new type of clock that would be significantly
    more accurate than the best atomic clocks available today."'

    way than before. For example, the Earth''s gravitational field could be analyzed
    so precisely that it could provide indications of mineral resources or earthquakes.
    The measurement method could also be used to get to the bottom of fundamental
    mysteries of physics: Are the constants of nature really constant? Or can tiny
    changes perhaps be measured over time? "Our measuring method is just the beginning,"
    says Thorsten Schumm. "We cannot yet predict what results we will achieve with
    it. It will certainly be very exciting."'
