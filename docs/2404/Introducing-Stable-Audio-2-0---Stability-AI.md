# Introducing Stable Audio 2.0 — Stability AI

> 来源：[https://stability.ai/news/stable-audio-2-0](https://stability.ai/news/stable-audio-2-0)

Today, we are pleased to introduce [Stable Audio 2.0](https://stableaudio.com/). This model enables high-quality, full tracks with coherent musical structure up to three minutes long at 44.1 kHz stereo from a single natural language prompt.

The new model goes beyond text-to-audio to include audio-to-audio capabilities. Users can now upload audio samples and, through natural language prompts, transform these samples into a wide array of sounds. This update also expands sound effect generation and style transfer, providing artists and musicians more flexibility, control, and an elevated creative process.

Stable Audio 2.0 builds upon [Stable Audio 1.0](https://stability.ai/news/stable-audio-using-ai-to-generate-music?__hstc=21858660.f6b5ccdfb81bac2a567ea0a5d95bab83.1711472661937.1711657025410.1711659307340.6&__hssc=21858660.1.1711659307340&__hsfp=851621926), which debuted in September 2023 as the first commercially viable AI music generation tool capable of producing high-quality 44.1kHz music, leveraging latent diffusion technology. It has since been named one of [TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023](https://stability.ai/news/stable-audio-times-best-inventions-of-2023?__hstc=21858660.f6b5ccdfb81bac2a567ea0a5d95bab83.1711472661937.1711657025410.1711659307340.6&__hssc=21858660.1.1711659307340&__hsfp=851621926).

This new model is available to use today for free on the Stable Audio [website](https://stableaudio.com/) and will soon be available on the Stable Audio API.
