    precision formation flying in orbit to create artificial solar eclipses. In a
    press conference last week, the agency announced details of the mission and the
    technology the orbiters will use to pull off its exquisitely-choreographed maneuvers.

    (PRoject for On-Board Autonomy) consists of a pair of spacecraft: a 300-kilogram
    Coronagraph spacecraft and a 250-kilogram [Occulter](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Proba_Missions/Face_to_face_with_Sun-eclipsing_Proba-3).
    The pair are now slated to launch on an Indian [PSLV rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle)
    in September and ultimately enter a highly elliptical, 600-by-60,530-kilometer
    orbit. The aim, the agency says, is to move the separate spacecraft to some 144
    meters apart, with the Occulter, as a disc, blocking out the sun.'

    study solar astrophysics without any intervention of the Earth’s atmosphere. The
    agency’s Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation
    of the Corona of the Sun ([ASPIICS](https://www.mps.mpg.de/6884329/proba-3)) coronagraph
    will help to discern why the solar corona is significantly hotter than the Sun
    itself. This could further our understanding of the Sun and assist solar weather

    will use radio inter-satellite links to communicate, and star trackers will be
    used by both craft for determining their attitude.

    around perigee, or the closest point to Earth, which, when combined with a dedicated
    relative navigation algorithm, will allow regular determination of their relative
    positions. Optical sensors on the Occulter will view pulsing LEDs on the Coronagraph
    to provide data for finer measurements. But greater, millimeter-scale precision
    requires more technological wizardry still.

    on the Coronagraph spacecraft, which will bounce the beam back. This act of [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology)
    will allow precise tracking of the relative position and orientation of the two
    spacecraft. Using the data gathered, the craft can, the ESA says, control and

    aboard the Occulter.
