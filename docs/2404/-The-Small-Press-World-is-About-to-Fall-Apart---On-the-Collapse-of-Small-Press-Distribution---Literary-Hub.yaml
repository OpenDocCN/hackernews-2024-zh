- en: Last week, Diane Goettel was on vacation in Florida when she saw an alarming
    email on her phone. After 55 years, [Small Press Distribution](https://spdbooks.org/)
    (SPD)—one of the last remaining independent book distributors in the US—was shutting
    down immediately, with no advance notice or transitional support. Its website
    went dark, its Twitter account was deleted, and no one was answering calls.

- en: “The small press world is about to fall apart,” Goettel remembers thinking.
    She’s the executive editor of [Black Lawrence Press](https://blacklawrencepress.com/),
    one of more than 400 publishers that relied on SPD to fulfill online orders and
    make copies available to bookstores and libraries. “A lot of people are really
    angry,” Goettel says. “I’m a little angry myself, but mostly I’m sad about the
    loss of this organization, and afraid of what it means.”

- en: On the other side of the country, the executive editor of [Noemi Press](https://www.noemipress.org/),
    Sarah Gzemski, was about to hop on a Zoom for her day job at the University of
    Arizona Poetry Center in Tucson when she received a text about SPD. “We were shocked,
    [though] some of the fulfillment issues we encountered over the past few months
    began to make more sense,” Gzemski says. “We’re already working on shoestring
    budgets, so for our distributor to close abruptly, without warning, while not
    paying us our earned income, is devastating.”

- en: Distributors are perhaps the most opaque and byzantine part of the publishing
    industry. When you buy a book on Amazon or Bookshop.org, it’s usually the distributor—not
    the publisher—who ships you a copy from its warehouse. When bookstores, libraries,
    and schools order books for their brick-and-mortar locations, they use online
    catalogs populated by distributors. Even further, most distributors (including
    SPD, before it vanished) employ sales teams that work to get copies in Barnes
    & Noble, independent bookstores, and other retail outlets like gift shops.
  prefs: []

    cut off from their main sources of income—and for some, SPD might have been the
    only affordable option left.

    of the [Hub City Writers Project](https://www.hubcity.org/) in Spartanburg, SC.
    “Larger distributors are going to have sales minimums that might not be financially
    viable, and self-distribution basically takes them out of the system in terms
    of getting reviewed in major publications or public radio.”

- en: Reid’s publishing imprint, Hub City Press, is distributed by Publishers Group
    West, a once-independent distributor that was acquired by Ingram in 2016\. Based
    just outside of Nashville, Ingram is the largest book wholesaler and distributor
    in the US, with more than 17 million titles available (Ingram is a sponsor of
    Literary Hub). In its email to publishers last week, SPD said all of its 300,000
    books had been transferred to either Ingram or Publishers Storage and Shipping
    (PSSC) warehouses—but that publishers would have to contact Ingram or PSSC themselves
    to get their books back.

    upwards of $8,000,” says Gzemski. “We just released three books [at Noemi], and
    all of the preorder and event order revenue from those books has disappeared.
    This is an enormous loss for us that impacts how we’ll need to proceed moving
    forward.”

    $17,000—an enormous sum for a small press. “It could be devastating. I don’t know
    what will happen if we don’t receive those funds,” she says. In the meantime,
    Black Lawrence Press has launched a [GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-black-lawrence-press)
    to help.

    back. “As a California nonprofit, SPD’s dissolution will be overseen by the Superior
    Court of California, which will determine the equitable disposition of SPD’s remaining
    assets to the extent all claims from creditors cannot be satisfied,” SPD executive
    director Kent Watson wrote in his sudden email on March 28.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, “it’s difficult to say what remaining assets exist,” according to Mary
    Gannon, executive director of the [Community of Literary Magazines & Presses](https://www.clmp.org/)
    (CLMP), many members of which were distributed by SPD. “Having to submit claims
    and figure out what may or may not be owed puts a significant burden on these
    small operations, especially when we’ve heard from some presses that they no longer
    have access to sales reports,” Gannon says. “Additionally, any presses that want
    their books returned from either Ingram or PSSC will need to pay for shipping,
    [which is] an additional cost.”

    didn’t receive a response before publication. Gannon, Gzemski, and Goettel have
    also attempted to contact Watson, with no response. In his mass email, Watson
    said that SPD staff had been “reduced to a minimal team that is in the process
    of winding down operations” and that they “are not able to respond to individual
    queries.”

    they’re adapting as quickly as they can. On an emergency Zoom call organized by
    the CLMP the day after the news broke, representatives from two alternative distributors

    a Minneapolis-based company long known for its beautiful typesetting and printing
    services, and [Asterism](https://asterismbooks.com/for-publishers), a newer company

    the working environment came to light, which, coupled with the abysmal business
    terms, made for an easy decision to try something different,” Rothes tells me.
    He’s referring to [an essay published](https://damagedbookworker.medium.com/terrorized-by-spd-612014765e7c)
    by a former SPD employee, as well as further [reports in 2021](https://www.kqed.org/news/11883845/how-former-employees-at-a-berkeley-bastion-for-literary-presses-ignited-a-reckoning)

- en: On the CLMP’s emergency Zoom, some presses were bullish on Asterism thanks to
    its low costs. But unlike Bookmobile and most other distributors, Asterism doesn’t
    currently offer returns to retailers, which leaves bookstores on the hook for
    any copies they ordered but didn’t sell.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Our returns policy has raised a few eyebrows, but I wouldn’t say we’ve met
    fierce resistance over it,” Rothes says. “We compromised with bookstores on event
    orders, [more] than 200 bookstores have signed up for accounts with Asterism so
    far, and it seems booksellers are generally happy to order fewer copies of more
    titles, and re-order when they need to.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Asterism also doesn’t currently distribute to Amazon, a major source of income
    for many small presses who see it as a necessary evil. “We don’t sell into marketplaces
    that routinely discount titles below what booksellers can sell them for,” Rothes
    says, “but we’re not exclusive and don’t demand control over all of our publishers’
    sales channels. Publishers can and do manage their own Amazon seller accounts,
    or take advantage of the integration options through print-on-demand services.”

    “We’ll absolutely maintain a dialogue with both booksellers and publishers, old
    and new, to determine when we might need to compromise or change course.”'

    could be prohibitively expensive, and Bookmobile or Asterism, which might be more
    affordable. “If they have the bandwidth, these presses can also sell their books
    directly to consumers, but the problem is discoverability,” Gannon says, echoing
    Meg Reid. “This is a devastating and sudden turn of events, [but those presses
    are] distinguished by their innovation and resilience.”

    comfort that we’re in the same boat as everyone else, and rushing into a new distributor
    without the proper research will not serve us well.”

    more broadly. “I’m not panicking at this point, but I would not be surprised if

    and literature in our country,” says Gannon. “They’re in the business because
    of their dedication to publishing the work of writers who would otherwise not

    them and find more robust solutions to make their books available.”
