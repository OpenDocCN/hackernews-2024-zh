    developers have contributed to upgrading the project to make use of the newer
    FFmpeg releases over the past 15 months, initially starting with targeting FFmpeg
    5, but later updating to FFmpeg 6\. We are always greatly appreciative of the
    work of all of the Open Source software projects that we rely on to bring you
    Kodi.

    developers many years ago, and we have now been able to finally remove the last
    remnants of SDL library usage in Kodi. We now use native implementations for window
    displays on the Apple macOS platform.

    regular use of code static-analysis tools, database migration fixes for a smoother

    you can either sideload, or join the [Google Play - Kodi testing track](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.xbmc.kodi)
    which will get the release submitted more quickly. The "open" release will be
    promoted from the testing track in a week or two. We strongly advise Android users
    who use alternative skins to follow up with their skin developer, or to disable
    auto update before this time period, as not every skin will yet have been updated.
