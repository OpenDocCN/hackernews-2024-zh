- en: At [Amazon's](/quotes/AMZN/) annual cloud conference in 2016, the company captured
    the crowd's attention by driving an 18-wheeler onstage. Andy Jassy, now Amazon's
    CEO, called it the Snowmobile, and said the company would be using the truck to
    help customers speedily transfer data to Amazon Web Services facilities.

    has stopped offering the service, CNBC has confirmed. The webpage devoted to AWS'
    "[Snow family](https://aws.amazon.com/snow/)" of products now directs users to
    its other data transport services, including the Snowball Edge, a 50-pound suitcase-sized
    device that can be equipped with fast solid-state drives, and the smaller Snowcone.

    networking, parking and security when they used the Snowmobile service, the spokesperson
    said.

    according to a page formerly on the AWS website. For a company with 100 petabytes
    of data — the capacity of a Snowmobile — a transfer job would cost about $500,000
    per month.

    the company to contend with lackluster sales growth. Amazon has [slashed](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazon-layoffs-company-to-cut-off-9000-more-workers.html)
    more than 27,000 jobs since late 2022 and has discontinued projects in the devices
    and retail units. The cuts have continued this year, with Amazon [laying off hundreds](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/amazon-layoffs-hundreds-of-jobs-cut-in-cloud-computing-unit.html)
    of jobs in AWS earlier this month.

    and [Google](/quotes/GOOGL/) Cloud Platform to get rid of products and services,
    the elimination of Snowmobile stands out due to the splashy way it was introduced
    at the company's showcase Reinvent conference in Las Vegas in late 2016.

    connection, it would take 26 years to move an exabyte, or 1 million terabytes,
    of data to the cloud, he said. An AWS customer could do the job with 10 Snowmobiles
    in under six months, he said. Each Snowmobile had a capacity of 100 petabytes
    on hard disk drives.

    coinciding with the launch on Nov. 30, 2016, Amazon cloud evangelist Jeff Barr
    described Snowmobile as "a ruggedized, tamper-resistant shipping container 45
    feet long, 9.6 feet high, and 8 feet wide" that "can be parked in a covered or
    uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center."
