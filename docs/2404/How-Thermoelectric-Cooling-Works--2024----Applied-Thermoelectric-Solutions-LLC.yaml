    of performance (COP) can be very high in some thermoelectric cooling applications
    and / or with proper system design. In other thermoelectric cooling applications
    and /or with poor system design, COP can be very low relative to other cooling
    technologies. So efficiency depends on the application and how well the system
    is engineered.'

- en: Another important idea is high thermoelectric cooling efficiency is not always
    needed. Small purposefully designed inefficient low-cost thermoelectric refrigerators
    are a popular and viable product that would not be viable with other cooling technologies.
    And customers are completely happy without ever considering if the product has
    a high cooling efficiency or not.

- en: Efficient products are often desired because they consume less power which makes
    them less costly to operate. To achieve less power consumption, thermoelectric
    cooling can be used for spot, zonal or distributed cooling rather than cooling
    an entire enclosure with another cooling technology that is not capable of spot
    cooling.

    cooling in some cases, the power consumption is still lower for the spot or zonal
    cooling using a thermoelectric cooling.

- en: For example one could use 10 watts of power to cool an object using an inefficient
    design or technology. Or use the most efficient cooling technology that cools
    an entire enclosure with 100 watts of power. High efficiency becomes irrelevant
    here. The choice is to use 10 watts or 100 watts of power consumption. It does
    not matter if the 100 watts of cooling is generated with a more efficient technology,
    it’s still 100 watts of power rather than 10 watts.

    simple enough. No moving parts, no complex mechanical contraptions, lights, sounds
    or vibrations. This simplistic look sometimes sends the wrong impression. The
    impression is that anybody can work with thermoelectric modules and achieve the
    desired results.'

    Worse yet, some assume that since they could not make the thermoelectric module
    do what they wanted it to, nobody can. And another unique and viable thermoelectric
    cooling product can go unrealized.

- en: '**3\. Cost-per-watt of Cooling** – If the only consideration for a given cooling
    application is cost per watt of cooling power, in some cases for some applications,
    cooling methods outside of thermoelectric cooling can be lower cost-per-watt of
    cooling power. However, cost-per-watt is never the only factor to be considered
    for a given application. Even if cost-per-watt is lower for a non-thermoelectric
    cooling application, other costs may be high when taking into other considerations
    such as reliability, size, design flexibility, environmental factors, temperature
    control, scalability, efficiency, maintenance, and other factors.'

    of engineering expertise to apply thermoelectric cooling to product design. Because
    of this, good help is hard to find. Thermoelectric module manufactures direct
    customers to try their products. And when the desired outcome is not achieved,
    customers give up and assume thermoelectric technology is not right for their
    application.'
