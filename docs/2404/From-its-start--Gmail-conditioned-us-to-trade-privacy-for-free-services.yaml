    had people assuming it was a joke. It wasn’t the first web-based email provider
    — Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail had already been around for years — but Gmail was offering
    faster service, automatic conversation grouping for messages, integrated search
    functions and 1GB of storage, which was at the time a huge leap forward in personal
    cloud storage. [Google](https://googlepress.blogspot.com/2004/04/google-gets-message-launches-gmail.html)
    in its press release boasted that a gigabyte was “more than 100 times” what its
    competitors offered. All of that, for free.

    no such thing as free. Using Gmail came with a tradeoff that’s now commonplace:
    You get access to its service, and in exchange, Google gets your data. Specifically,
    its software could scan the contents of account holders’ emails and use that information
    to serve them personalized ads on the site’s sidebar. For better or worse, it
    was a groundbreaking approach.'

    nightmare, yet it grew — and generated a lot of hype, thanks to its invite-only
    status in the first few years, which spurred a reselling market for Gmail invitations
    at upwards of $150 a pop, according to [*TIME*](https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7212db91-cd64-4c1b-ab0d-1d1c998f089e&siteId=us-engadget&pageId=1p-autolink&featureId=text-link&merchantName=time&custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RpbWUuY29tLzQzMjYzL2dtYWlsLTEwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnkvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI2MDI0N2YyMy01NDhjLTRhOTctYjRjYS0xZGNkZTc2ZjI2YTYifQ&signature=AQAAAZfvKlVWVca0dz_OOF19z4cjHDbRtj0fD5d2tdapdCfd&gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F43263%2Fgmail-10th-anniversary%2F).
    Google continued its ad-related email scanning practices for over a decade, despite
    the heat, carrying on through Gmail’s public rollout in 2007 and well into the
    2010s, when it really started gaining traction.

    laps around the other services at the time, and in many ways still does. It made
    the privacy concerns, for some, easier to swallow. From its inception, [Gmail
    set the bar pretty high](https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-gmail-15-years.html)
    with its suite of free features. Users could suddenly send files of up to 25MB

    for Google — which had already established itself with its search engine. “A lot
    of people thought it was a very bad idea, from both a product and a strategic
    standpoint,” Gmail creator Paul Buchheit told *TIME* in 2014\. “The concern was

    Gmail [crossed the one billion user mark](https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-01-gmail-1-billion-active-users.html)
    in 2016, and its numbers have since doubled. It’s still leading the way in email
    innovation, 20 years after it first went online, integrating increasingly advanced
    features to make the process of receiving and responding to emails (which, let’s
    be honest, is a dreaded daily chore for a lot of us) much easier. Gmail may eventually
    have changed its approach to data collection, but the precedent it set is now
    deeply enmeshed in the exchange of services on the internet; companies take what
    data they can from consumers *while* they can and ask for forgiveness later.
