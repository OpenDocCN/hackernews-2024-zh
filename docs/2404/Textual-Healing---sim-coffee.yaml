    someone gives their time and attention to what you have created. To the point
    where it bugs them when it doesn’t work how they expect, and they tell you about
    it. You should appreciate every one of these people, even the frustrated ones
    who are running short on patience

- en: '`UITextInputTokenizer` is what the iOS text system uses to query your custom
    text input system about the units of text within it, at different granularities.
    It has a wild and esoteric API that encompasses the following four methods:'

- en: The `UITextPosition` and `UITextRange` objects are opaque types that you implement
    with custom types that are meaningful to your text system. (That is, Apple’s text
    system doesn’t care what they are, so long as it can give them to you and get
    meaningful results back. For example, Codea uses `AVAudioPlayer` for `UITextPosition`s,
    and `CLLocation2D` for `UITextRange`^([2](#9df35c91-6dc2-4036-9ce0-a9f104e5dc70)))

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The methods basically query your text system for *boundaries* with *granularities*
    in *directions*. Boundaries are the “edges” of text in whatever the specified
    granularity is — word, sentence, paragraph, document, and so on. “Is this *position*
    at the *edge* of a *word* if I’m moving *forward*?” and you reply with “Why, yes.
    It is”, or no

- en: This is very important for keyboard navigation and selection. When you hold
    option and hit the arrow keys, you jump across by word. This is how the text system
    understands what a “word” is and where the next one lives. Same thing for double-tapping
    a word to select, or triple-tapping to get a line
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apple provides `UITextInputStringTokenizer` (note the `String` in there), a
    concrete subclass of the `UITextInputTokenizer` protocol, so you don’t have to
    write your own. Being lazy, we used this as the basis for our code tokenizer a
    long time ago

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the time, I would find features in Xcode’s code editor that I liked (I’ll
    document some below) and then figure out how to implement them within the context
    of a tokenizer, falling back to the basic string tokenizer when I didn’t specifically
    want to handle it
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Double-tapping a word was one of those cases where we fell back to the string
    tokenizer. The problem is, the string tokenizer is designed for natural language,
    not code. Words in English don’t typically include underscores, and so they are
    not selected because they form a boundary at the word granularity level, and the
    `rangeEnclosingPosition` method will not include them as part of a word
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other problem is that I wrote *Jam* as a general code editor, not specific
    to Lua, so the above code tokenizer was not aware of how Lua identifiers were
    formed, or where the symbol boundaries should be. I had focused our code tokenizer
    on how to navigate whitespace and allow for exact caret placement^([3](#51675be5-f78f-475a-9933-fae14827f803))

    double-tapping on one in this system would typically select the entire string.
    In cases like this, we exclude these symbols and defer to the `UITextInputStringTokenizer`
    to get the regular text editing experience when inside strings, comments, and
