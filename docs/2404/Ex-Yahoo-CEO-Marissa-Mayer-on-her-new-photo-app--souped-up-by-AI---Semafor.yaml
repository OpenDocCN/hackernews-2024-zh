- en: '**A:** Photos and contacts go together. It’s obvious when you think about it,
    but the contacts you’re closest to, you tend to spend time with, and if you spend
    time with them in this day and age you have photos of and with them. So you can
    understand people’s relationships if you can look at their camera roll. And now
    with the beauty of AI, we can actually analyze someone’s camera roll really succinctly
    and have an understanding of who you spend time with, when, where and why, at
    least in broad brushstrokes.'

    helping take those mundane, everyday touches and make them magical and really
    helping people feel connected to each other. Contacts are a big part of that.
    It was the foundation and that’s why we started there. But photos are perhaps
    one of the most meaningful ways that we all interact with each other. The way
    we all build those relationships.

    to influence it. One way to think of it is if Instagram is one perfectly filtered,
    edited photo that you push out to everyone you know and don’t know who is in your
    follower base, and person-to-person photo sharing is me snapping a picture and
    texting it or air dropping it to you, Shine tries to sit in that space in between.

    That’s really the space we’re trying to occupy.
  id: totrans-split-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s not a lot happening in that space. I refer to it as smart, small-scale
    sharing. The early social networks and early social media tried to fill that space.
    But then people would join, they wouldn’t see a lot of the people there that they
    wanted to share with. So they looked for who is famous, which is why you suddenly
    started to get these counts into the millions for celebrity followers.
  id: totrans-split-12

    families and your close contacts and they’ve got stuff going on in their lives
    that they want to share with you, too. That’s really the space we want to play
    in. I think Snapchat showed this in a different way — you can share in a way that’s
    a little bit less perfect, and a little bit temporary and in the moment. There’s
    something really powerful about that.

    a scene of the first dance, the child blowing out the birthday candles and you
    feel the need to pull your phone out and take the same picture. Because you’re
    like ‘okay, the only way I’m going to be sure I get it is I actually take it.’
    To me, these types of tools can let us be much more in the moment. At the same
    time we don’t want to just move a lot of photos around because there are lots
    of duplicates that aren’t organized.

    that you would want to see. And yes, if they took eight pictures and they weren’t
    sure which one has all the eyes open, and they weren’t sure which one wasn’t blurry,
    AI can do all of that.'

    it doesn’t mean that you have to necessarily have a Shine album right now. You
    can actually build Shine albums in the past. We’ve built AI algorithms that go
    back over the metadata of your camera roll. Where were you, when did you take
    pictures? Basically analysis of it, and try to understand where and when you take
    boring, mundane photos that you probably don’t want to share, and where and when,
    and what do you take pictures of when they’re pictures that you do want to share?
    So we got AI operating there as well.

    small-scale sharing that you want to do at events. The natural place to get the

    The nice thing is that in that case, you know the group of people, you know they’re
    all going to be there. And if you can actually just make the photo sharing contiguous.

    about linguistics. I understood it was important for the intelligence to express

    past decade or two, been much more on learning. Building the models, reinforcement
    learning, all of the different techniques that go into building a modern day model
    right now, and then deploying those models, giving them new things to reason about
    and see how they perform. That’s where all the energy is gone.

    fact that it can talk and express itself and write in a way that you can understand
    and feels really intelligent. The fact that Dall-E can draw these wonderfully
    complicated pictures that would take an artist days or weeks to express. That
    really captured the imagination.

    connect them forwards. I do think that when you look at everything Google did
    from spell check to Google Translate, this notion of building things that weren’t
    modern day LLMs but basically used huge amounts of data, huge amounts of compute

- en: '**A:** I do some angel investing, but it’s pretty limited. Obviously, a lot
    of my investment in time and resources goes to Sunshine these days. I invested
    in a company called Halo AI a few years ago that is basically doing AI analysis,
    radiology images, and ultimately doing very early detection screens on things
    like cancer and various conditions. I wanted to be a doctor for a long time when
    I was growing up. Those types of medical advances and medical applications always
    get me really excited.'

- en: '**A:** I love all phases of companies. I had a funny conversation with my mom,
    many years ago, where she was talking about one of my friends who had just said,
    ‘oh my gosh, 4 is my favorite age.’ And afterwards, she said, ‘I feel so bad for
    her because someday, she’s going to have a 5-year-old.’ And my mom was like, ‘I
    love all phases of my children.’ And it was before I had children, before I was
    married, and I said, ‘you know, Mom, I think I love all phases of companies.’
    I was like, ‘I like it when they’re small, when it’s single digits, double digits,
    triple, quadruple. I love it when I’m an individual contributor, I like managing
    small teams, big teams, teams of thousands. I love the hypergrowth, I even love
    the challenge of turning around a company that’s in decline or a product line
    that is in decline. It’s one of the richest, most interesting intellectual and
    design problems you can work on. I just love building things. That’s really what
    a company is about. It’s about building products, businesses, teams and cultures.
    That work and the way that all comes together is just truly fascinating.'

- en: '**A:** Maybe it’s the fundamental engineering mindset. I just love systems.
    I love symbolic systems and the way they support what is now modern day AI. That’s
    a system, the system of cognition, the system of a body, I love the system of
    a company. I like thinking about really complicated systems and how to make them
    work better. And that’s what products are, too, whether it’s a search engine or
    a photo sharing app like Shine. They’re all complicated, interesting systems that
    overall can be made to work better and more efficiently and have a bigger impact.'
