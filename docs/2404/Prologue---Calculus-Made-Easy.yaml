    thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to
    master the same tricks.

- en: Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools
    who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics — and they are mostly clever fools
    — seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the
    contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness
    by going about it in the most difficult way.

    and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master
    these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.
