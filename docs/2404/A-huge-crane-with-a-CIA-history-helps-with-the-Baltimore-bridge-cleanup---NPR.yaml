    Key Bridge in Baltimore. At the center of the wreckage removal is a massive decades-old
    crane – the largest on the East Coast.

    of this are really difficult to describe or to fathom," Transportation Secretary
    Pete Buttigieg [told *All Things Considered* last week](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/29/1241726859/transportation-secretary-buttigieg-gives-update-on-baltimore-key-bridge).'

    Its nickname is "Chessy," and because of its sheer size, it has held many prominent
    jobs over the decades.

    of the Pacific Ocean. To recover the sub, without the Soviets knowing, the U.S.
    needed a new deep sea ship.

    says Todd Bennett, an associate professor of history at East Carolina University.
    "And even more importantly, the portion of the sub that the CIA targeted contained
    a code room, a working code machine and then materials it was thought that explained
    how that device worked."'

    expect for a deep ocean mining vessel. That is in large part because the ship
    had to hide in plain sight.

    His firm was privately owned. There were no SEC reports to file. And so Hughes''
