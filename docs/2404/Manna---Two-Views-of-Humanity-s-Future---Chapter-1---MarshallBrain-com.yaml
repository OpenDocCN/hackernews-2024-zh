- en: Depending on how you want to think about it, it was funny or inevitable or symbolic
    that the robotic takeover did not start at MIT, NASA, Microsoft or Ford. It started
    at a Burger-G restaurant in Cary, NC on May 17\. It seemed like such a simple
    thing at the time, but May 17 marked a pivotal moment in human history.

- en: Burger-G was a fast food chain that had come out of nowhere starting with its
    first restaurant in Cary. The Burger-G chain had an attitude and a style that
    said “hip” and “fun” to a wide swath of the American middle class. The chain was
    able to grow with surprising speed based on its popularity and the public persona
    of the young founder, Joe Garcia. Over time, Burger-G grew to 1,000 outlets in
    the U.S. and showed no signs of slowing down. If the trend continued, Burger-G
    would soon be one of the “Top 5” fast food restaurants in the U.S.

- en: The “robot” installed at this first Burger-G restaurant looked nothing like
    the robots of popular culture. It was not hominid like C-3PO or futuristic like
    R2-D2 or industrial like an assembly line robot. Instead it was simply a PC sitting
    in the back corner of the restaurant running a piece of software. The software
    was called “Manna”, version 1.0^*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manna’s job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting way.
    Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at the
    store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and out
    on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to taking
    the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees
    reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers
    hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day. This was
    a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-first century, there were
    millions of businesses that operated in this way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The
    problem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run
    perfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms, great
    customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were chaotic
    and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a customer
    off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores were the Achilles
    heel of any chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and commissioned
    a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the managers and
    tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna version 1.0 was
    born.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manna was connected to the cash registers, so it knew how many people were flowing
    through the restaurant. The software could therefore predict with uncanny accuracy
    when the trash cans would fill up, the toilets would get dirty and the tables
    needed wiping down. The software was also attached to the time clock, so it knew
    who was working in the restaurant. Manna also had “help buttons” throughout the
    restaurant. Small signs on the buttons told customers to push them if they needed
    help or saw a problem. There was a button in the restroom that a customer could
    press if the restroom had a problem. There was a button on each trashcan. There
    was a button near each cash register, one in the kiddie area and so on. These
    buttons let customers give Manna a heads up when something went wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At any given moment Manna had a list of things that it needed to do. There were
    orders coming in from the cash registers, so Manna directed employees to prepare
    those meals. There were also toilets to be scrubbed on a regular basis, floors
    to mop, tables to wipe, sidewalks to sweep, buns to defrost, inventory to rotate,
    windows to wash and so on. Manna kept track of the hundreds of tasks that needed
    to get done, and assigned each task to an employee one at a time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manna told employees what to do simply by talking to them. Employees each put
    on a headset when they punched in. Manna had a voice synthesizer, and with its
    synthesized voice Manna told everyone exactly what to do through their headsets.
    Constantly. Manna micro-managed minimum wage employees to create perfect performance.

    Manna would make sure that she carefully washed her hands. Then Manna would immediately
    start Jane working on a new task. Meanwhile, Manna might send Lisa to the restroom
    to inspect it and make sure that Jane had done a thorough job. Manna would ask
    Lisa to check the toilets, the floor, the sink and the mirrors. If Jane missed
    anything, Lisa would report it.

    right in the middle of Cary with my parents. My father was a pilot for a big airline.
    My mother was a stay-at-home mom and I had a younger sister. We lived in a typical
    four bedroom suburban home in a nice neighborhood with a swimming pool in the
    backyard. I was a 15 year-old teenager working at the Burger-G on May 17 when
    the first Manna system came online.

    to me and telling me what to do. It was creepy at first, but that feeling really
    only lasted a day or so. Then you were used to it, and the job really did get
    easier. Manna never pushed you around, never yelled at you. The girls liked it
    because Manna didn’t hit on them either. Manna simply asked you to do something,
    you did it, you said, “OK”, and Manna asked you to do the next step. Each step
    was easy. You could go through the whole day on autopilot, and Manna made sure
    that you were constantly doing something. At the end of the shift Manna always
    said the same thing. “You are done for today. Thank you for your help.” Then you
    took off your headset and put it back on the rack to recharge. The first few minutes
    off the headset were always disorienting — there had been this voice in your head
    telling you exactly what to do in minute detail for six or eight hours. You had
    to turn your brain back on to get out of the restaurant.

- en: To me, Manna was OK. The job at Burger-G was mindless, and Manna made it easy
    by telling you exactly what to do. You could even get Manna to play music through
    your headphones, in the background. Manna had a set of “stations” that you could
    choose from. That was a bonus. And Manna kept you busy the entire day. Every single
    minute, you had something that Manna was telling you to do. If you simply turned
    off your brain and went with the flow of Manna, the day went by very fast.

    day he saw me wearing the headset in the restaurant. He and Mom had come in for
    lunch and to say hi. I knew they were coming, so I had timed my break so I could
    sit down with them for a few minutes. When I sat down, my father noticed the headset.

    corporate guys in the restaurant watching us, fixing bugs in the software, making
    sure Manna was covering all the bases, and they were pleased. It took about 3
    months to work all the kinks out, and as they did the Manna software totally changed
    the restaurant. Worker performance nearly doubled. So did customer satisfaction.
    So did the consistency of the customer’s experience. Trash cans never overfilled.
    Bathrooms were remarkably clean. Employees always washed their hands when they
    needed to. Food was ready faster. The meals we handed out were nearly 100 percent
    accurate because Manna made us check to make sure every item in the bag was exactly
    what the customer ordered. The store never ran out of supplies — there were always
    plenty of napkins in the dispenser and the ketchup container was always full.
    There were enough employees in the store for the busy times, because Manna could
    accurately track trends and staff appropriately.

    in the United States. Manna worked so well that Burger-G deployed it nationwide.
    Soon Burger-G had cut more than 3,000 of its higher-paid store employees — mostly
    assistant managers and managers. That one change saved the company nearly $100
    million per year, and all that money came straight to the bottom line for the
    restaurant chain. Shareholders were ecstatic. Mr. G gave himself another big raise
    to celebrate. In addition, Manna had optimized store staffing and had gotten a
    significant productivity boost out of the employees in the store. That saved another
    $150 million. $250 million made a huge difference in the fast food industry.

    employees as everyone had expected. The robots replaced middle management and
    significantly improved the performance of minimum wage employees. All of the other
    fast food chains watched the Burger-G experiment with Manna closely, and they
    started installing Manna systems as well. Soon, nearly every business in America
    that had a significant pool of minimum-wage employees was installing Manna software
    or something similar. They had to do it in order to compete.
