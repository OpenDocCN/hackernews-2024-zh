    that the robotic takeover did not start at MIT, NASA, Microsoft or Ford. It started
    at a Burger-G restaurant in Cary, NC on May 17\. It seemed like such a simple
    thing at the time, but May 17 marked a pivotal moment in human history.

  zh: 根据你的思考方式，这件事可能既滑稽又不可避免，或者象征深远，机器人接管并未从MIT、NASA、Microsoft或Ford开始，而是从Cary, NC的一家Burger-G餐厅开始于5月17日。当时看起来是如此简单的一件事情，但5月17日标志着人类历史的一个关键时刻。
- en: Burger-G was a fast food chain that had come out of nowhere starting with its
    first restaurant in Cary. The Burger-G chain had an attitude and a style that
    said “hip” and “fun” to a wide swath of the American middle class. The chain was
    able to grow with surprising speed based on its popularity and the public persona
    of the young founder, Joe Garcia. Over time, Burger-G grew to 1,000 outlets in
    the U.S. and showed no signs of slowing down. If the trend continued, Burger-G
    would soon be one of the “Top 5” fast food restaurants in the U.S.

  zh: Burger-G是一家快餐连锁店，从Cary的第一家餐厅开始迅速崛起。Burger-G连锁店以其流行和年轻创始人乔·加西亚的公众形象，对美国中产阶级产生了“时尚”和“有趣”的影响。这家连锁店以惊人的速度增长，迅速扩展到美国的1000家门店，并且显示出无任何减速的迹象。如果这一趋势持续下去，Burger-G很快将成为美国前五大快餐连锁店之一。
- en: The “robot” installed at this first Burger-G restaurant looked nothing like
    the robots of popular culture. It was not hominid like C-3PO or futuristic like
    R2-D2 or industrial like an assembly line robot. Instead it was simply a PC sitting
    in the back corner of the restaurant running a piece of software. The software
    was called “Manna”, version 1.0^*.

  zh: 安装在第一家Burger-G餐厅的“机器人”与流行文化中的机器人大不相同。它不像C-3PO那样人形，也不像R2-D2那样未来化，或像装配线机器人那样工业化。相反，它只是一台安装在餐厅后角落的个人电脑，运行着一款软件。这款软件名为“Manna”，版本1.0^*。
- en: Manna’s job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting way.
    Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at the
    store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and out
    on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to taking
    the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees
    reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers
    hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day. This was
    a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-first century, there were
    millions of businesses that operated in this way.

  zh: Manna的工作是管理这家商店，而它以一种非常有趣的方式做到了这一点。想象一下普通的快餐店。一群员工在店里工作，通常一个普通餐厅有50人，他们每周轮班。这些人做的工作包括制作汉堡、接受订单、清洁桌子和倒垃圾等等。所有这些员工都向店长和几个副经理报告。经理们雇佣员工，安排他们的工作，并告诉他们每天要做什么。这是一个完全正常的安排。在21世纪初，有数以百万计的企业以这种方式运作。
- en: But the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The
    problem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run
    perfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms, great
    customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were chaotic
    and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a customer
    off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores were the Achilles
    heel of any chain.

  zh: 但是快餐行业存在一个问题，Burger-G也不例外。问题在于快餐体验的质量。有些餐厅运营得很完美。他们的员工礼貌周到，卫生间干净，客户服务出色，订单准确率高。而其他一些餐厅则混乱不堪，让顾客感到不舒服。由于一次糟糕的经历可能导致顾客对整个连锁店的反感，这些管理不善的店铺是任何连锁店的软肋。
- en: To solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and commissioned
    a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the managers and
    tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna version 1.0 was
    born.

  zh: 为了解决问题，Burger-G与软件顾问签订了合同并委托开发了一款软件。这款软件的目标是替代经理，以更可控的方式告诉员工应该做什么。Manna 1.0版本诞生了。
- en: Manna was connected to the cash registers, so it knew how many people were flowing
    through the restaurant. The software could therefore predict with uncanny accuracy
    when the trash cans would fill up, the toilets would get dirty and the tables
    needed wiping down. The software was also attached to the time clock, so it knew
    who was working in the restaurant. Manna also had “help buttons” throughout the
    restaurant. Small signs on the buttons told customers to push them if they needed
    help or saw a problem. There was a button in the restroom that a customer could
    press if the restroom had a problem. There was a button on each trashcan. There
    was a button near each cash register, one in the kiddie area and so on. These
    buttons let customers give Manna a heads up when something went wrong.

  zh: 玛娜连接到收银机，因此它知道有多少人在餐厅流动。因此，软件可以准确预测垃圾桶何时会装满、厕所何时变脏以及需要擦拭的桌子。该软件还连接到时间钟，因此它知道谁在餐厅工作。玛娜还在餐厅各处设置了“帮助按钮”。按钮上的小标识告诉顾客，如果需要帮助或发现问题，请按下按钮。在洗手间有一个按钮，顾客可以按下它以报告洗手间的问题。每个垃圾桶旁边都有一个按钮。在每个收银机附近有一个按钮，在儿童区域也有一个按钮，等等。这些按钮让顾客在出现问题时可以提前通知玛娜。
- en: At any given moment Manna had a list of things that it needed to do. There were
    orders coming in from the cash registers, so Manna directed employees to prepare
    those meals. There were also toilets to be scrubbed on a regular basis, floors
    to mop, tables to wipe, sidewalks to sweep, buns to defrost, inventory to rotate,
    windows to wash and so on. Manna kept track of the hundreds of tasks that needed
    to get done, and assigned each task to an employee one at a time.

- en: Manna told employees what to do simply by talking to them. Employees each put
    on a headset when they punched in. Manna had a voice synthesizer, and with its
    synthesized voice Manna told everyone exactly what to do through their headsets.
    Constantly. Manna micro-managed minimum wage employees to create perfect performance.

    right in the middle of Cary with my parents. My father was a pilot for a big airline.
    My mother was a stay-at-home mom and I had a younger sister. We lived in a typical
    four bedroom suburban home in a nice neighborhood with a swimming pool in the
    backyard. I was a 15 year-old teenager working at the Burger-G on May 17 when

    to me and telling me what to do. It was creepy at first, but that feeling really
    only lasted a day or so. Then you were used to it, and the job really did get
    easier. Manna never pushed you around, never yelled at you. The girls liked it
    because Manna didn’t hit on them either. Manna simply asked you to do something,
    you did it, you said, “OK”, and Manna asked you to do the next step. Each step
    was easy. You could go through the whole day on autopilot, and Manna made sure
    that you were constantly doing something. At the end of the shift Manna always
    said the same thing. “You are done for today. Thank you for your help.” Then you
    took off your headset and put it back on the rack to recharge. The first few minutes
    off the headset were always disorienting — there had been this voice in your head
    telling you exactly what to do in minute detail for six or eight hours. You had

    —— 头脑里有一个声音六到八个小时里一直告诉你要做的事情。你必须重新启动你的大脑才能离开餐馆。

    by telling you exactly what to do. You could even get Manna to play music through
    your headphones, in the background. Manna had a set of “stations” that you could
    choose from. That was a bonus. And Manna kept you busy the entire day. Every single
    minute, you had something that Manna was telling you to do. If you simply turned

    So did the consistency of the customer’s experience. Trash cans never overfilled.
    Bathrooms were remarkably clean. Employees always washed their hands when they
    needed to. Food was ready faster. The meals we handed out were nearly 100 percent

    in the United States. Manna worked so well that Burger-G deployed it nationwide.
    Soon Burger-G had cut more than 3,000 of its higher-paid store employees — mostly
    assistant managers and managers. That one change saved the company nearly $100
    million per year, and all that money came straight to the bottom line for the
    restaurant chain. Shareholders were ecstatic. Mr. G gave himself another big raise
    to celebrate. In addition, Manna had optimized store staffing and had gotten a
    significant productivity boost out of the employees in the store. That saved another

- en: So, the first wave of fast food robots did not replace all of the burger flipping
    employees as everyone had expected. The robots replaced middle management and
    significantly improved the performance of minimum wage employees. All of the other
    fast food chains watched the Burger-G experiment with Manna closely, and they
    started installing Manna systems as well. Soon, nearly every business in America
    that had a significant pool of minimum-wage employees was installing Manna software
    or something similar. They had to do it in order to compete.

  zh: 所以，第一波快餐机器人并没有像每个人预期的那样替代所有翻转汉堡的员工。机器人替代了中层管理，并显著提高了最低工资员工的表现。所有其他快餐连锁店都密切关注着Burger-G用曼纳进行的试验，并开始安装曼纳系统。很快，几乎每一家在美国有大量最低工资员工的企业都在安装曼纳软件或类似的东西。他们不得不这样做才能竞争。

    And my dad was right. It was when all of these new Manna systems began talking
    to each other that things started to get uncomfortable.
