    Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home
    in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that
    "there is no definition of a mental disorder. It''s bullshit. I mean, you just
    can''t define it." Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he''s
    taking in the strangeness of this scene: [Allen Frances](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-5/content/article/10168/1425378),
    lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association''s *Diagnostic
    and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (universally known as the [*DSM*-IV](http://allpsych.com/disorders/dsm.html)),
    the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that "these concepts
    are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries."
    For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt.'

    why he came out of a seemingly contented retirement to launch a bitter and protracted
    battle with the people, some of them friends, who are creating the next edition
    of the *DSM*. And to criticize them not just once, and not in professional mumbo
    jumbo that would keep the fight inside the professional family, but repeatedly
    and in plain English, in newspapers and magazines and blogs. And to accuse his
    colleagues not just of bad science but of bad faith, hubris, and blindness, of
    making diseases out of everyday suffering and, as a result, padding the bottom
    lines of drug companies. These aren't new accusations to level at psychiatry,
    but Frances used to be their target, not their source. He's hurling grenades into
    the bunker where he spent his entire career.

- en: One influential advocate for diagnosing bipolar disorder in kids failed to disclose
    money he received from the makers of the bipolar drug Risperdal.As a practicing
    psychotherapist myself, I can attest that this is a startling turn. But when Frances
    tries to explain it, he resists the kinds of reasons that mental health professionals
    usually give each other, the ones about character traits or personality quirks
    formed in childhood. He says he doesn't want to give ammunition to his enemies,
    who have already shown their willingness to "shoot the messenger." It's not an
    unfounded concern. In its first official response to Frances, the [APA](http://www.psych.org/)
    diagnosed him with "pride of authorship" and pointed out that his royalty payments
    would end once the new edition was published—a fact that "should be considered
    when evaluating his critique and its timing."

    to just 10 grand a year), also claims not to mind if the APA cites his faults.
    He just wishes they'd go after the right ones—the serious errors in the *DSM*-IV.
    "We made mistakes that had terrible consequences," he says. Diagnoses of [autism](https://health.google.com/health/ref/Autism),
    attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder skyrocketed, and
    Frances thinks his manual inadvertently facilitated these epidemics—and, in the
    bargain, fostered an increasing tendency to chalk up life's difficulties to mental
    illness and then treat them with psychiatric drugs.

- en: The insurgency against the *DSM*-5 (the APA has decided to shed the Roman numerals)
    has now spread far beyond just Allen Frances. Psychiatrists at the top of their
    specialties, clinicians at prominent hospitals, and even some contributors to
    the new edition have expressed deep reservations about it. Dissidents complain
    that the revision process is in disarray and that the preliminary results, made
    public for the first time in February 2010, are filled with potential clinical
    and public relations nightmares. Although most of the dissenters are squeamish
    about making their concerns public—especially because of a surprisingly restrictive
    nondisclosure agreement that all insiders were required to sign—they are becoming
    increasingly restive, and some are beginning to agree with Frances that public
    pressure may be the only way to derail a train that he fears will "take psychiatry
    off a cliff."

- en: At stake in the fight between Frances and the APA is more than professional
    turf, more than careers and reputations, more than the $6.5 million in sales that
    the *DSM* averages each year. The book is the basis of psychiatrists' authority
    to pronounce upon our mental health, to command health care dollars from insurance
    companies for treatment and from government agencies for research. It is as important
    to psychiatrists as the Constitution is to the US government or the Bible is to
    Christians. Outside the profession, too, the *DSM* rules, serving as the authoritative
    text for psychologists, social workers, and other mental health workers; it is
    invoked by lawyers in arguing over the culpability of criminal defendants and
    by parents seeking school services for their children. If, as Frances warns, the
    new volume is an "absolute disaster," it could cause a seismic shift in the way
    mental health care is practiced in this country. It could cause the APA to lose
    its franchise on our psychic suffering, the naming rights to our pain.
