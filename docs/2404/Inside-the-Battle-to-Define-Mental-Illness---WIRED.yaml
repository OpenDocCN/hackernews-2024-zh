    Just now, for instance, in the predawn darkness of his comfortable, rambling home
    in Carmel, California, he has broken off his exercise routine to declare that
    "there is no definition of a mental disorder. It''s bullshit. I mean, you just
    can''t define it." Then an odd, reflective look crosses his face, as if he''s
    taking in the strangeness of this scene: [Allen Frances](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/dsm-5/content/article/10168/1425378),
    lead editor of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association''s *Diagnostic
    and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (universally known as the [*DSM*-IV](http://allpsych.com/disorders/dsm.html)),
    the guy who wrote the book on mental illness, confessing that "these concepts
    are virtually impossible to define precisely with bright lines at the boundaries."
    For the first time in two days, the conversation comes to an awkward halt.'

    why he came out of a seemingly contented retirement to launch a bitter and protracted
    battle with the people, some of them friends, who are creating the next edition
    of the *DSM*. And to criticize them not just once, and not in professional mumbo
    jumbo that would keep the fight inside the professional family, but repeatedly
    and in plain English, in newspapers and magazines and blogs. And to accuse his
    colleagues not just of bad science but of bad faith, hubris, and blindness, of
    making diseases out of everyday suffering and, as a result, padding the bottom
    lines of drug companies. These aren't new accusations to level at psychiatry,
    but Frances used to be their target, not their source. He's hurling grenades into
    the bunker where he spent his entire career.

- en: One influential advocate for diagnosing bipolar disorder in kids failed to disclose
    money he received from the makers of the bipolar drug Risperdal.As a practicing
    psychotherapist myself, I can attest that this is a startling turn. But when Frances
    tries to explain it, he resists the kinds of reasons that mental health professionals
    usually give each other, the ones about character traits or personality quirks
    formed in childhood. He says he doesn't want to give ammunition to his enemies,
    who have already shown their willingness to "shoot the messenger." It's not an
    unfounded concern. In its first official response to Frances, the [APA](http://www.psych.org/)
    diagnosed him with "pride of authorship" and pointed out that his royalty payments
    would end once the new edition was published—a fact that "should be considered
    when evaluating his critique and its timing."

- en: Frances, who claims he doesn't care about the royalties (which amount, he says,
    to just 10 grand a year), also claims not to mind if the APA cites his faults.
    He just wishes they'd go after the right ones—the serious errors in the *DSM*-IV.
    "We made mistakes that had terrible consequences," he says. Diagnoses of [autism](https://health.google.com/health/ref/Autism),
    attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorder skyrocketed, and
    Frances thinks his manual inadvertently facilitated these epidemics—and, in the
    bargain, fostered an increasing tendency to chalk up life's difficulties to mental
    illness and then treat them with psychiatric drugs.

  zh: 弗朗西斯声称他并不在意版税（他说每年只有一万美元），他还声称并不介意APA指出他的错误。他只希望他们能追究对的错——*DSM*-IV中的严重错误。“我们犯了一些导致可怕后果的错误，”他说。自闭症、注意缺陷多动障碍和双相情感障碍的诊断数量激增，弗朗西斯认为他的手册无意中促进了这些流行病，并且在交易中，增加了把生活困难归因于精神疾病并用精神药物治疗的倾向。
- en: The insurgency against the *DSM*-5 (the APA has decided to shed the Roman numerals)
    has now spread far beyond just Allen Frances. Psychiatrists at the top of their
    specialties, clinicians at prominent hospitals, and even some contributors to
    the new edition have expressed deep reservations about it. Dissidents complain
    that the revision process is in disarray and that the preliminary results, made
    public for the first time in February 2010, are filled with potential clinical
    and public relations nightmares. Although most of the dissenters are squeamish
    about making their concerns public—especially because of a surprisingly restrictive
    nondisclosure agreement that all insiders were required to sign—they are becoming
    increasingly restive, and some are beginning to agree with Frances that public
    pressure may be the only way to derail a train that he fears will "take psychiatry
    off a cliff."

  zh: 反对*DSM*-5（APA已决定放弃罗马数字）的起义现在不仅仅限于艾伦·弗朗西斯。各自专业顶尖的精神病学家、知名医院的临床医生，甚至新版本的一些贡献者都对它深表保留。反对者抱怨修订过程混乱不堪，并且公开发表于2010年2月的初步结果充满了潜在的临床和公关灾难。尽管大多数持异议者对公开表达自己的关切感到犹豫不决——尤其是因为所有内部人员都被要求签署了一份令人惊讶的限制性保密协议——但他们变得越来越不安静，一些人开始赞同弗朗西斯的观点，即公众压力可能是阻止这趟他担心会“把精神病学推向悬崖边缘”的列车的唯一途径。
- en: At stake in the fight between Frances and the APA is more than professional
    turf, more than careers and reputations, more than the $6.5 million in sales that
    the *DSM* averages each year. The book is the basis of psychiatrists' authority
    to pronounce upon our mental health, to command health care dollars from insurance
    companies for treatment and from government agencies for research. It is as important
    to psychiatrists as the Constitution is to the US government or the Bible is to
    Christians. Outside the profession, too, the *DSM* rules, serving as the authoritative
    text for psychologists, social workers, and other mental health workers; it is
    invoked by lawyers in arguing over the culpability of criminal defendants and
    by parents seeking school services for their children. If, as Frances warns, the
    new volume is an "absolute disaster," it could cause a seismic shift in the way
    mental health care is practiced in this country. It could cause the APA to lose
    its franchise on our psychic suffering, the naming rights to our pain.

  zh: 在弗朗西斯和美国精神病学会（APA）之间的争斗中，涉及的不仅是专业领域，也不仅仅是职业和声誉，甚至不仅仅是每年平均销售额达到650万美元的*DSM*。这本书是精神病学家评判我们心理健康、要求保险公司提供治疗和政府机构提供研究资金的依据。对于精神病学家来说，它的重要性就像宪法对美国政府或圣经对基督徒的重要性一样。在专业之外，*DSM*也具有影响力，它是心理学家、社会工作者和其他心理健康工作者的权威文本；律师们在辩论犯罪被告的过失责任和父母们寻求子女学校服务时也会援引它。如弗朗西斯所警告的那样，如果新版是一个“彻头彻尾的灾难”，它可能会导致这个国家心理健康护理实践方式的地震性变化。这可能导致APA失去我们心灵痛苦的特许经营权，失去对我们痛苦的命名权。
