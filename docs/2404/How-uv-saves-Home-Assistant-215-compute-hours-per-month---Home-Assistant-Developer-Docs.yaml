- en: By replacing `pip` with `uv` in our production images, our build pipeline (and
    therefore releasing a new version) is a lot faster. `Uv` is an extremely fast
    Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It is developed by [Astral](https://astral.sh/)
    and it's open source. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

- en: In total, we save around 215 hours per month. With this massive improvement,
    we can now ship hotfixes even faster, as the pipeline to ship a new version now
    takes around 20 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.

- en: The 215 monthly saved execution hours can be used by other jobs and make the
    CI experience for all developers and our community better. By replacing `pip`
    with `uv`, we improve our sustainability by using fewer resources to build our
    images.
