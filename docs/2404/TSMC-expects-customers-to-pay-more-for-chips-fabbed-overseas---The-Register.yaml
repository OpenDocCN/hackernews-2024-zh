  zh: 台积电总裁魏哲家表示，想在该芯片巨头的非台湾设施进行制造的客户将需要分担费用，即通过支付更高的价格来分担成本。
- en: During the Q&A part of [TSMC's Q1 earnings call](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/10/tsmc_sees_semiconductor_bounce_with/),
    an analyst [asked](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/18/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-tsm-q1-2024-ear/)
    the CEO how the world's largest chip contract maker would cope with rising expenses,
    such as electricity, in order to achieve the targeted 53 percent gross margin
    in 2025.

  zh: 在[TSMC Q1收益电话会议](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/10/tsmc_sees_semiconductor_bounce_with/)的问答环节中，分析师[问到](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/18/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-tsm-q1-2024-ear/)首席执行官，作为全球最大芯片合同制造商，如何应对日益上涨的开支，例如电力开支，以实现2025年目标的53%的毛利润。
- en: The analyst suggested that if the cost of doing business was going up and could
    erode gross margin, the only way to offset that would be to perform price hikes.

  zh: 分析师建议，如果业务成本上升并可能侵蚀毛利率，唯一抵消的方式就是提高价格。
- en: Although Wei said he couldn't disclose pricing strategies as such information
    is confidential, he did elaborate on how pricing would work at fabs with higher
    operation expenses. "We do encounter some kind of higher cost in the overseas
    or even recently, the inflation and the electricity."

    started our discussion with our customers," he continued, confirming that higher
    production costs would be at least partly funded by higher prices.'

- en: '"As I said, for the overseas fab, we want to share our value, which also includes
    the flexibility of geopolitical location or something like that," he said. "If
    my customer requests to be in some certain area, then definitely, TSMC and the
    customer has to share the incremental cost."'

  zh: “正如我所说，对于海外晶圆厂，我们希望分享我们的价值，这也包括地缘政治位置的灵活性或类似的事物”，他说道。“如果我的客户要求在某些特定地区，那么毫无疑问，台积电和客户必须共同分担额外的成本。”
- en: Geopolitics are a chief reason why TSMC is setting up shop in the US in the
    first place, in spite of American fabs being more expensive. China has claimed
    Taiwan rightfully belongs under its control ever since the end of the Chinese
    Civil War in 1949, which ended with the Chinese Communist Party establishing the
    People's Republic of China on the mainland, and the exile of the Nationalist or
    Kuomintang-led Republic of China to Taiwan.

  zh: 地缘政治是台积电首次在美国设立工厂的主要原因，尽管美国的晶圆厂更昂贵。自1949年中国内战结束以来，中国一直声称台湾合法归属于其控制之下，当时中国共产党在大陆建立了中华人民共和国，而国民党领导的中华民国则流亡到了台湾。
- en: Although China has never made a full-blown attempt to seize Taiwan and dismantle
    its rival once and for all, fears of a Chinese invasion have increased in recent
    years, especially since Taiwan became an extremely important strategic asset thanks
    to TSMC's cutting-edge fabs. A successful invasion may cut off the West from TSMC's
    chips, but even a failed attempt [could cause serious damage](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/china_taiwan_wargame_scenarios/).

  zh: 尽管中国从未试图全面夺取台湾并彻底解体其对手，但近年来对中国入侵的担忧增加，尤其是自从台积电（TSMC）的尖端晶圆厂使台湾成为极为重要的战略资产以来。一次成功的入侵可能会使西方无法获得TSMC的芯片，但即使是一次失败的尝试，也可能会造成严重损害。([详细内容](https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/china_taiwan_wargame_scenarios/))
- en: That's essentially the geopolitical value Wei refers to with overseas fabs,
    because they're probably not going to be the target of military operations any
    time soon. Of course, since building fabs in places like the US isn't the best
    choice financially, TSMC has received [billions of dollars in subsidies](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/08/tsmc_116b_arizona_funding/).

  zh: 那基本上就是魏所指的海外晶圆厂的地缘政治价值，因为它们很可能不会很快成为军事行动的目标。当然，由于在美国等地建设晶圆厂在财务上不是最佳选择，台积电已经获得了[数十亿美元的补贴](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/08/tsmc_116b_arizona_funding/)。
- en: Wei didn't specify exactly how much more expensive its fabs abroad would be,
    but considering TSMC probably wouldn't have built them without receiving $11 billion
    in grants and loans, we can guess the difference could be quite substantial. ®

  zh: Wei没有具体说明其海外晶圆厂会更昂贵多少，但考虑到台积电可能不会在没有获得110亿美元的补助和贷款的情况下建设这些厂房，我们可以猜测差距可能相当可观。®
