    Dennett was a member of the critically endangered species of polymath, a talent
    that is becoming less and less common while social media, artificial intelligence,
    religious dogma, and restrictive government policies creep in to make us, humans,
    more and more thoughtless, lucrative, and tax-worthy.

    considered one of their own. A person of this sort is born, perhaps, once every
    few centuries, and we didn’t appreciate how lucky we were to have lived alongside
    him. Now, Daniel C. Dennett is joining the long line of philosophy’s greatest
    thinkers who are forever etched in our thoughts and memories. If the theists are
    right, and God exists, then it won’t bode well for the theists who insultingly
    write on his X (Twitter) profile that he’s now at God’s mercy. Rather, it’s the
    other way around: that deity will have to watch out if he knows what’s good for
    him. Heaven is under new management, and God just got a demotion for two thousand
    years of such incompetently sloppy work. I imagine him rolling up his sleeve,
    as he storms into God’s office, saying “Move aside, oaf! It’s going to literally
    take a genius to unravel the mess you made since time immemorial!”'

- en: As a titan who towers among the giants of philosophy, of old and new, and whose
    legendary eccentricity, exceptional brilliance, and peerlessly witty humour were
    too much for one discipline to handle, a great void, vast like a supermassive
    black hole at the epicenter of a galaxy with an insatiable hunger to devour all
    in its path, has emerged abruptly. I know that, if he were here, he’d tell us
    to get our acts together and continue what he started. There is so much to be
    done in philosophy, and Dennett gave it his all, fighting the dogma, intolerance,
    and cruelties of religions, and the myriad forms of ignorance taking up the anodyne
    appearances of “theories” in various disciplines. Don’t let instrumentalism die.

- en: The best way to honour our fallen champion is by rallying by his memory and
    legacies and finishing what he started. If there is a theism-versus-atheism debate,
    bring up his name. If there is some mumbo-jumbo about free will or consciousness,
    bring up his name; dilute the idea of unconstrained free will; reduce consciousness
    to a series of memes! Cite his name in your articles and books, and keep citing
    him. Let’s build on his theories and make instrumentalism a dominant perspective,
    not only in philosophy but in society at large. No matter what anyone says, Dennett
    didn’t “die”; he merely took on another form as our collective thoughts. He is
    now bigger than ever; theists will never be able to shake him off. And the best
    way to keep him alive is by building on his legacy.
