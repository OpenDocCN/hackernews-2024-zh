- en: On April 12, 2019, Boston University finally fired David Marchant for sexually
    harassing Willenbring. (The university said it could not corroborate her claims
    of physical and psychological abuse.) Marchant released a statement, which the
    journal *Science* quoted as vowing that he had “never” sexually harassed anyone,
    “not in 1998 or 1999 in Antarctica or at any time since.” But because of Willenbring,
    the word was out.

    an outside study on sexual assault and sexual harassment at the Antarctic research
    facilities. The lengthy report, made public in August 2022, had shocking allegations
    of assault, stalking, and harassment. Britt Barquist, the former fuel foreman,
    was on contract at McMurdo with a company now called Amentum. She oversaw a crew
    of about 20 who did the dangerous work of handling and cleaning diesel and gasoline
    fuel tanks. One day in late November 2017, she tells me, she was sitting at a
    table alongside a man who held a senior position at Leidos, the company managing
    the Antarctic research stations. He’d been running a briefing for the staff when
    he groped her in plain view.

    the incident himself. His boss reported it to the human resources department at
    Amentum. “I told HR that I don’t want to be anywhere around him ever again. I
    am scared of this person,” Barquist says, “And they said, ‘OK.’”

    told she’d be attending weekly virtual meetings with that same senior official.
    Barquist, who needed the job, downplayed it to herself. “It was just disgusting
    and awful to have to look at his face and listen to him talk,” she says, “just
    to see him treated as a normal guy, when in my head I’m like, ‘This guy is a predator.
    Why is everyone just acting like he’s some normal person?’”

    a crew in New Zealand, she’d scanned the manifest for an upcoming flight to Antarctica
    and saw the senior official’s name on it. When she called her HR department over
    a spotty connection to complain, she says she was met with obstinance by two officials,
    one of whom had been introduced as a victim’s advocate.

    ‘So how do you suggest we deal with this?’” Barquist gets emotional as she recalls
    her conversation with the two women from her employer. “I thought they were going
    to be on my side,” she says. Instead, they kept pressing her as to how afraid
    she felt to be around him.

    with him!’” Then the signal dropped, she says, and she never managed to reconnect
    with them. Barquist flew back to Antarctica, where she tried to avoid the senior
    official. But as her team’s safety depended on her communicating with him on a
    nearly daily basis, she eventually relented.
