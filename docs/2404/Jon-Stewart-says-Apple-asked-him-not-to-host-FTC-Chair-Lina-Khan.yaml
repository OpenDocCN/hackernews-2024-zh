- en: Jon Stewart [hosted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaDTiWaYfcM) FTC (Federal
    Trade Commission) chair Lina Khan on his weekly Daily Show segment yesterday,
    but Stewart's own revelations were just as interesting as Khan's. During the sit-down,
    Stewart admitted that Apple asked him not to host Khan on a podcast, which was
    an extension of his [*The Problem with Jon Stewart*](https://www.engadget.com/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-221022043.html)
    Apple TV+ show at the time.

    told Khan. "They literally said, ''Please don’t talk to her.''"'

    do" theme. Ahead of the Khan interview, Stewart did a [segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20TAkcy3aBY)
    on artificial intelligence he called "the false promise of AI," effectively debunking
    altruistic claims of AI leaders and positing that it was strictly designed to
    replace human employees.

    on AI," he told Khan. "Like, what is that sensitivity? Why are they so afraid
    to even have these conversations out in the public sphere?"'

    ahead of its third season, reportedly following clashes over potential AI and
    China segments. That prompted US lawmakers to [question Apple](https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-question-apple-over-cancellation-of-jon-stewarts-show-192316298.html),
    seeking to know if the decision had anything to do with possible criticism of

    coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing
    these determinations," the bipartisan committee wrote. (Apple's response to this,
    if any, has yet to be released.)

    show was cancelled, but they do indicate that Apple asserted editorial influence
    over issues that directly involved it.

    that the FTC alleges the company is a monopoly maintained via illegal practices
    (exorbitant seller fees, shady ads). They also touched on the FTC's lawsuit against
    Facebook, tech company collusion via AI, corporate consolidation, exorbitant drug
    prices and more.
