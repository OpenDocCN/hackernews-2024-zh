    let most U.S. hospitals [pay nothing](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nonprofit-hospitals-tax-breaks-community-benefit/)

    status to so-called nonprofit hospitals even as many of them are financially taking
    advantage of sick Americans with inflated medical bills. Several of my Johns Hopkins
    colleagues and I [published](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2737183)
    a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that some nonprofit
    hospitals sue and garnish the wages of low-income patients who can’t afford to
    pay their medical bills. Where’s the community benefit in that? Nonprofit hospitals
    are supposed to be compassionate and merciful, not predatory and ruthless.

    with the federal [hospital transparency rule](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/key-initiatives/hospital-price-transparency/hospitals)
    which requires hospitals to post prices for common shoppable services. The most
    recent money game that nonprofit hospitals are dialing up is adding billions of
    dollars in [“facility fees”](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/hidden-hospital-fees-cost-patients-hundreds-of-dollars-0024cd95)
    for routine care. These billing tricks are fleecing everyday Americans. Congress
    could make them disappear overnight if it passed a law disqualifying hospitals
    that use them from getting the coveted tax-exempt benefit.

    care. But here’s what’s really going on: Much of what they call free care is emergency
    care that hospitals are required to provide by law (the 1986 [Emergency Medical
    Treatment and Labor Act](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)
    requires hospitals to care for anyone who walks in with an emergent condition).
    But after the care has been provided, patients are often hounded for payment,
    often at an artificially inflated price. Hospitals then report the difference
    between their high sticker price and what they actually collect after shaking
    down a patient as charity care.'

    Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01627) found
    that for-profit hospitals provided 65% *more* charity care than nonprofit ones.

    taxes in order to survive. But the way taxes work, businesses are taxed only on
    their profits. Some hospitals hide their profits in cost-shift accounting and
    loan refinancing, even engaging in aggressive real estate and venture capital
    investing. According to [public tax records](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/951644600),
    Cedars Sinai in Beverly Hills had an income surplus of $750 million in 2022 and
    paid no federal taxes. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had
    $400 million and also paid no federal taxes. The top three hospital administrators
    there made nearly $20 million in salaries.

    can do it without insurance or cash up front. It’s nearly impossible. Most nonprofit
    hospitals will refuse to schedule appointments, even cancer care, unless you financially
    qualify by showing your ability to pay.

    qualify, arguing that they are a business, they should pay their fair share of
    taxes like every other American business. A Kaiser Family Foundation [study](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/the-estimated-value-of-tax-exemption-for-nonprofit-hospitals-was-about-28-billion-in-2020/)
    estimated the total value of tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals was $28 billion
    in 2020 alone. By my calculation, that’s equivalent to a $107 tax credit for every
    American who filed a return that year.

    It’s also the agency’s hostility to direct primary care and other creative strategies
    developed by doctors to address chronic diseases. The IRS does not allow individuals
    or families who subscribe to direct primary care — a type of intensive primary
    care that takes extra time to focus on prevention — to include that cost as a
    tax-deductible health savings account expense. A [2019 White House executive order](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-price-quality-transparency-american-healthcare-put-patients-first/#:~:text=potentially%20including%20direct%20primary%20care%20arrangements%20and%20healthcare%20sharing%20ministries%2C%20as%20eligible%20medical%20expenses)
