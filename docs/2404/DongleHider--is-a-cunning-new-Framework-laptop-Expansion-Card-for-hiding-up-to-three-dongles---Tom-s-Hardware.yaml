- en: Developer and maker LeoDJ has shared his design for a Framework laptop expansion
    card that will surely gain wide appreciation among owners of the modular PC. The
     [DongleHider+](https://community.frame.work/t/donglehider-multiple-dongles-and-a-normal-usb-a-socket/47187)
    can fit up to three dongles inside and offers an outward-facing USB Type-A connector.

    your Logitech Unifying dongle-sized device successfully, its outer casing needs
    to be removed.

    so they wanted to keep the Logitech Unifying dongle permanently plugged into his
    laptop without spoiling the device's clean lines. The DongleHider+ project admirably
    achieves these goals, and more, by providing connectivity for up to three (tiny)
    dongles and offering a handy [USB Type-A](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/usb-3-2-explained)
    port.

    footsteps. From the Framework [community post](https://community.frame.work/t/donglehider-multiple-dongles-and-a-normal-usb-a-socket/47187),
    you can head over to the maker's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LeoDJ/FW-EC-DongleHiderPlus?tab=readme-ov-file)
    and [Mastodon thread](https://chaos.social/@LeoDJ/112108367751183162)s, which
    are packed with useful source files for getting the PCB and Framework laptop expansion
    card made. The Mastodon thread is particularly useful as it offers a pictorial
    assembly guide.

    in the dongles they want to install permanently in the DongleHider+, but LeoDJ
    says they are pretty cheap on used goods marketplaces. Clear instructions for
    disassembling Logitech's Unifying Gen1 and Gen2 dongles are provided. Furthermore,
    the soldering of the dongle to the PCB shouldn't be too challenging – especially
    if you only decide to install a single dongle internally.
