- en: In the four-month pilot trial, Sethi’s team followed 21 adult participants who
    were diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, taking antipsychotic medications,
    and had a metabolic abnormality — such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia,
    dyslipidemia or impaired glucose tolerance. The participants were instructed to
    follow a ketogenic diet, with approximately 10% of the calories from carbohydrates,
    30% from protein and 60% from fat. They were not told to count calories.

    vegetables, and not restricting fats,” said Sethi, who shared keto-friendly meal
    ideas with the participants. They were also given keto cookbooks and access to
    a health coach.

    weekly measures of blood ketone levels. (Ketones are acids produced when the body
    breaks down fat — instead of glucose — for energy.) By the end of the trial, 14
    patients had been fully adherent, six were semi-adherent and only one was non-adherent.

    defined as having at least three of five conditions: abdominal obesity, elevated
    triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting
    glucose levels. After four months on a ketogenic diet, none of the participants
    had metabolic syndrome.'

    circumference by 11% percent; and had lower blood pressure, body mass index, triglycerides,
    blood sugar levels and insulin resistance.

    we can still reverse the obesity, the metabolic syndrome, the insulin resistance.
    I think that’s very encouraging for patients.”

    31% on a psychiatrist rating of mental illness known as the clinical global impressions
    scale, with three-quarters of the group showing clinically meaningful improvement.
    Overall, the participants also reported better sleep and greater life satisfaction.

    diet. “We saw more benefit with the adherent group compared with the semi-adherent
    group, indicating a potential dose-response relationship,” Sethi said.

    and bipolar disorder stem from metabolic deficits in the brain, which affect the
    excitability of neurons, Sethi said.

    of the body’s metabolism, it also improves the brain’s metabolism.

    brain health anyway,” Sethi said. “But the ketogenic diet can provide ketones
    as an alternative fuel to glucose for a brain with energy dysfunction.”

    the design of larger, more robust studies.
