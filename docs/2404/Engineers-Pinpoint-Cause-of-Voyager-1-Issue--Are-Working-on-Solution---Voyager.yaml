- en: Engineers have confirmed that a small portion of corrupted memory in one of
    the computers aboard NASA’s Voyager 1 has been causing the spacecraft to send
    unreadable science and engineering data to Earth since last November. Called the
    flight data subsystem (FDS), the computer is responsible for packaging the probe’s
    science and engineering data before the telemetry modulation unit (TMU) and radio
    transmitter send the data to Earth.

- en: '[In early March](https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/03/15/nasa-engineers-make-progress-toward-understanding-voyager-1-issue/),
    the team issued a “poke” command to prompt the spacecraft to send back a readout
    of the FDS memory, which includes the computer’s software code as well as variables
    (values used in the code that can change based on commands or the spacecraft’s
    status). Using the readout, the team has confirmed that about 3% of the FDS memory
    has been corrupted, preventing the computer from carrying out normal operations.'

- en: The team suspects that a single chip responsible for storing part of the affected
    portion of the FDS memory isn’t working. Engineers can’t determine with certainty
    what caused the issue. Two possibilities are that the chip could have been hit
    by an energetic particle from space or that it simply may have worn out after
    46 years.

- en: Although it may take weeks or months, engineers are optimistic they can find
    a way for the FDS to operate normally without the unusable memory hardware, which
    would enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering data again.

    spacecraft flew by Saturn and Jupiter, and Voyager 2 flew by Uranus and Neptune.
    They are both exploring interstellar space, outside the bubble of particles and
    magnetic fields created by the Sun, called the heliosphere. Voyager 2 continues
    to operate normally.'
