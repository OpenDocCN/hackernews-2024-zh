- en: On April 19, 1824, Lord Byron died at Missolonghi, where he had gone to lend
    his name and give financial support to the Greek war for independence from the
    Ottoman Empire. After being drenched by a sudden rainstorm while out riding, the
    poet developed a fever, from which he might well have recovered had it not been
    for some disastrous medical treatment, chiefly bleeding with leeches that left
    him weak and dehydrated. He was just 36.
