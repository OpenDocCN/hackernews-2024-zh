    industry trade group, as well as several companies. The challengers said the 2023
    law violates the Constitution''s First Amendment by requiring anyone using the
    platforms in question, including adults, to submit personal information.'

- en: One provision of the law, known as H.B. 1181, mandates that platforms verify
    users' ages by requiring them to submit information about their identities. Although
    the law is aimed at limiting children's access to sexually explicit content, the
    lawsuit focuses on how those measures also affect adults. "Specifically, the act
    requires adults to comply with intrusive age verification measures that mandate
    the submission of personally identifying information over the internet in order
    to access websites containing sensitive and intimate content," the challengers
    wrote in court papers.*
