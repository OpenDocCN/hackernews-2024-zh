    workplaces," she said. "One person noted when an employer merged with an organization
    whose religious principles conflicted with their own, a noncompete kept the worker
    locked in place and unable to freely switch to a job that didn''t conflict with
    their religious practices."'

    from minimum wage earners to CEOs, are [bound by noncompetes](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148446019/ftc-rule-ban-noncompetes-low-wage-workers-trade-secrets).

    existing noncompetes that companies have given their senior executives, on the
    grounds that these agreements are more likely to have been negotiated. The FTC
    says employers should not enforce other existing noncompete agreements.

    Holyoak and Andrew Ferguson, argued that the FTC was overstepping the boundaries
    of its power. Holyoak predicted the ban would be challenged in court and eventually
    struck down.

    noncompetes are vital to companies, by allowing them to better guard trade secrets,
    and employees, by giving employers greater incentive to invest in workforce training
    and development.
