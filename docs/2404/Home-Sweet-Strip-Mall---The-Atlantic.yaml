    Suburban Michigan is full of winding roads dotted with identical houses, strip
    malls stuffed with chain restaurants and big-box stores, and thoroughfares designed
    for cars, with pedestrian walkways as an afterthought. The anthropologist Marc
    Augé coined the term [*non-places*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Non_Places/DVycEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)
    to describe interchangeable, impersonal spaces lacking in history and culture
    that people pass through quickly and anonymously. Non-places—such as shopping
    centers, gas stations, and highways—can be found everywhere but seem to particularly
    proliferate in suburbs like the one I grew up in. The writer James Howard Kunstler
    memorably called this sort of landscape “the geography of nowhere.”

- en: In his book of the same title, Kunstler traces the history of the suburbs from
    the Puritans’ 17th-century conception of private property up to the early 1990s,
    when [*The Geography of Nowhere*](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780671888251)
    was published. He argues that, enamored with both automobiles and the sheer amount
    of space in this country, the U.S. built a sprawling empire of suburbs because,
    as he puts it, “it seemed like a good idea at the time.” But this arrangement
    has proved to be “deeply demoralizing and psychologically punishing,” he told
    me in an email—not only because the design of suburbia is unsightly but because
    it is at odds with human connection and flourishing. He doesn’t mince words about
    what he sees as the consequences of this way of life, writing in his book that
    “the immersive ugliness of the built environment in the USA is entropy made visible,”
    and suggesting that America has become “a nation of people conditioned to spend
    their lives in places not worth caring about.”

    colorfully. Perhaps because of the sometimes bland and homogenous built environment,
    many people assume the suburbs have a conformist culture too. These places have
    long been associated with [boredom](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2007/03/30/criticism-of-boring-suburban-lifestyle-is-nearly-timeless/),
    with a vague, free-floating malaise. (Or, as one writer [bluntly put it](https://qz.com/698928/why-suburbia-sucks),
    “You know it sucks, but it’s hard to say exactly why.”) There is a Subreddit with
    60,000 members called “Suburban Hell.” All of this adds up to a popular conception
    of suburbs as indistinct and interchangeable—they are “[no-man’s-land](https://www.americanheritage.com/suburbs),”
    the “middle of nowhere.” And this idea doesn’t come only from city slickers sneering
    at “flyover country.” Jason Diamond, the author of the book [*The Sprawl*](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781566895828),
    said in an [interview with *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-24/how-the-american-suburb-conquered-popular-culture?embedded-checkout=true)
    that he’s noticed a “self-hatred” among people who come from suburbia.

    proportion of the U.S. that is suburbia is difficult—the federal government, in
    much of its data, [doesn’t distinguish “suburban”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-14/u-s-is-majority-suburban-but-doesn-t-define-suburb?embedded-checkout=true)
    as a category distinct from “rural” and “urban” (perhaps implying that it, too,
    considers these places not worth caring about). But in [the 2017 American Housing
    Survey](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/AHS-neighborhood-description-study-2017.html#overview-tab),
    the government asked people to describe their own neighborhoods, and 52 percent
    classified them as suburban. These neighborhoods aren’t frozen 1950s stereotypes,
    either; they are evolving places. For instance, once synonymous with segregation,
    the suburbs are [now more diverse than ever](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/todays-suburbs-are-symbolic-of-americas-rising-diversity-a-2020-census-portrait/).

    is connection and emotion. Where there is connection and emotion, nostalgia follows.
    And so, yes, decades of policy decisions and corporate development have led to
    what Kunstler calls the “depressing, brutal, ugly, unhealthy, and spiritually
    degrading” landscapes of the suburbs. But at the same time, many people who have
    called these places home still have a sentimental connection to them, any spiritual
    degradation notwithstanding. And a curious side effect of the ubiquity of suburban
    institutions is that I can feel that small spark of recognition—of, dare I say
    it, “home”—anywhere I encounter it.'

    north of Chicago, then to Chicago proper, then to Washington, D.C., where I’ve
    lived for more than 10 years. Yet at the risk of being one of the “apologists
    for the ubiquitous highway crud” whom Kunstler derides in his book, I must say
    that even after all this time, I feel at home in a strip mall. It is familiar;
    it is my heritage. At least once a year, the winds blow in from the Midwest, and
    I cannot rest until I make a pilgrimage to an Olive Garden. If home is “nowhere,”
    and nowhere has spread almost everywhere, then many places can remind you of home.

    feel like our formative tastes and our earliest emotions were hijacked by consumer
    culture and decades of zoning law. But nostalgia isn’t really a reflection of
    whether something is good or bad, researchers tell me; quality is essentially
    irrelevant. What matters is whether something holds meaning *for you*. And places
    are “easy for us to attach emotionality to,” Krystine Batcho, a professor of psychology
    at Le Moyne College who studies nostalgia, told me. Although suburban nostalgia
    might be stronger for people like me who’ve moved away from the burbs, a place
    can be an active part of your life and still “cue those old memories” each time
    you visit, Clay Routledge, a psychologist who directs the Human Flourishing Lab
    at the nonprofit think tank Archbridge Institute, told me.

    basically the same and bear only a passing resemblance to actual Mexican cuisine?
    Definitely. But I’ll always love it, not just because I think it’s delicious but
    because that’s where my high-school friends and I would go to pick up sacks of
    99-cent bean burritos to bring back for dinner when drama rehearsal was scheduled
    to run late. So Taco Bell bean burritos, to me, taste like staying at school until
    9 p.m. and trying to do homework on the side of the stage between scenes, like
    the intense friendships of a ragtag group of teens figuring out who they are by
    pretending to be other people.

    on what makes people attached to a place shows that the social ties associated
    with it are a huge factor. In a [survey that Routledge did](https://humanflourishinglab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HFL-Nostalgia-in-America_2023.pdf)
    last year, he found that almost three-quarters of Americans reported that their
    nostalgic memories were associated with close friends and family, as opposed to
    experiences they had with strangers or alone. Nostalgia for place, it seems, is
    really nostalgia for people.

    and kind of basic—it’s that it’s actively bad for community. [Third places](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/third-places-meet-new-people-pandemic/629468/)—spots
    just for hanging out, aside from work or home—are in short supply; homes are clustered
    far from commercial zones, making it next to impossible to walk safely anywhere.
    “The only way to be in that public realm is to be in a car, often alone,” Kunstler
    writes. “Where, then, are you going to have your public assembly? On the median
    strip of Interstate 87?” [Some](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41622280_Sense_of_Community_and_its_Relationship_with_Walking_and_Neighborhood_Design)

    emotion, Batcho said. It tugs the homesick person between past and present, between
    how things were, how they are, and how they could be. Rachel Heiman, an associate
    professor of anthropology at the New School and the author of [*Driving After
    Class*](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780520277755), told me that she fears the
    connection people have to the kinds of spaces they’re familiar with could be a
    detriment to building new and better kinds of communities. “We can’t just keep
    building our suburbs the way we are, even if some people are nostalgic for that,”
    she said. She gave the example of someone who feels safer and more comfortable
    driving a car than riding public transit, even though public transit is [objectively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906382/)
