    Suburban Michigan is full of winding roads dotted with identical houses, strip
    malls stuffed with chain restaurants and big-box stores, and thoroughfares designed
    for cars, with pedestrian walkways as an afterthought. The anthropologist Marc
    Augé coined the term [*non-places*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Non_Places/DVycEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)
    to describe interchangeable, impersonal spaces lacking in history and culture
    that people pass through quickly and anonymously. Non-places—such as shopping
    centers, gas stations, and highways—can be found everywhere but seem to particularly
    proliferate in suburbs like the one I grew up in. The writer James Howard Kunstler
    memorably called this sort of landscape “the geography of nowhere.”

    Augé）创造了术语 [*非地方*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Non_Places/DVycEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)，用以描述缺乏历史和文化，人们迅速匿名通过的可互换、无个性的空间。非地方——如购物中心、加油站和高速公路——无处不在，但似乎尤其在我成长的这种郊区中繁殖。作家詹姆斯·霍华德·昆斯勒（James
    Howard Kunstler）生动地称这种景观为“无处的地理”。
- en: In his book of the same title, Kunstler traces the history of the suburbs from
    the Puritans’ 17th-century conception of private property up to the early 1990s,
    when [*The Geography of Nowhere*](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780671888251)
    was published. He argues that, enamored with both automobiles and the sheer amount
    of space in this country, the U.S. built a sprawling empire of suburbs because,
    as he puts it, “it seemed like a good idea at the time.” But this arrangement
    has proved to be “deeply demoralizing and psychologically punishing,” he told
    me in an email—not only because the design of suburbia is unsightly but because
    it is at odds with human connection and flourishing. He doesn’t mince words about
    what he sees as the consequences of this way of life, writing in his book that
    “the immersive ugliness of the built environment in the USA is entropy made visible,”
    and suggesting that America has become “a nation of people conditioned to spend
    their lives in places not worth caring about.”

    但是这种安排被证明是“深深的挫败和心理上的惩罚”，他在一封电子邮件中告诉我，这不仅因为郊区设计丑陋，而且与人类的联系和繁荣背道而驰。在他的书中，他毫不掩饰地描述了这种生活方式的后果，“美国建筑环境的沉浸式丑陋是可见的熵”，并暗示美国已成为“一个民族，习惯于在毫不在乎的地方度过一生。”

    colorfully. Perhaps because of the sometimes bland and homogenous built environment,
    many people assume the suburbs have a conformist culture too. These places have
    long been associated with [boredom](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2007/03/30/criticism-of-boring-suburban-lifestyle-is-nearly-timeless/),
    with a vague, free-floating malaise. (Or, as one writer [bluntly put it](https://qz.com/698928/why-suburbia-sucks),
    “You know it sucks, but it’s hard to say exactly why.”) There is a Subreddit with
    60,000 members called “Suburban Hell.” All of this adds up to a popular conception
    of suburbs as indistinct and interchangeable—they are “[no-man’s-land](https://www.americanheritage.com/suburbs),”
    the “middle of nowhere.” And this idea doesn’t come only from city slickers sneering
    at “flyover country.” Jason Diamond, the author of the book [*The Sprawl*](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781566895828),
    said in an [interview with *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-24/how-the-american-suburb-conquered-popular-culture?embedded-checkout=true)

    degrading” landscapes of the suburbs. But at the same time, many people who have
    called these places home still have a sentimental connection to them, any spiritual

    connection people have to the kinds of spaces they’re familiar with could be a
    detriment to building new and better kinds of communities. “We can’t just keep
    building our suburbs the way we are, even if some people are nostalgic for that,”
    she said. She gave the example of someone who feels safer and more comfortable
    driving a car than riding public transit, even though public transit is [objectively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906382/)
    [safer](https://slate.com/business/2022/02/car-safety-department-of-transportation-transit-a-plea.html).
    Might they be resistant to supporting new bus or rail routes in their community?

    as an emotion that holds people back, nostalgia can also be fuel for progress.
    It can make people more [creative](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000116),

    and motivated: Reflecting on cherished memories of the past can remind people
    of what they really value. And if there’s a disconnect between what we loved about
    the past and the way things are now, “that discrepancy can easily remind us that
    we should move forward,” Batcho said. “We should build better things.”'

  zh: 但是，巴乔和劳特利奇告诉我，与普遍认为它是阻碍人们前进的情感相反，怀旧也可以成为进步的动力。它可以使人们更有创造力、*灵感*和动力：反思过去珍贵的记忆可以提醒人们他们真正珍视的东西。如果我们喜爱的过去与现在的情况有所不同，“这种差异可以很容易地提醒我们应该向前迈进，”
    巴乔说道。“我们应该建造更好的事物。”

    is called “self-continuity,” and Routledge’s research shows that [nostalgia facilitates
    it](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26751632/). So feeling nostalgic for the landscapes
    of suburbia doesn’t necessarily mean I think that’s the best way to design a community—it’s
    just part of my story. My soft spot for Olive Garden’s huge portions of mediocre
    fettuccine alfredo is just the vessel for the things I actually value: the feeling
    of belonging to a place and its people, the comforts of accumulated memories that
    adhere to spaces.'
