- en: This blog, and the vast majority of the code I write, is written in Emacs with
    [`evil`](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) (a vim emulation mode). I have a
    nasty habit of mashing `:w2<ret>` when I really was trying to save the current
    buffer with `:w<ret>` . `:w2` writes the current buffer to a new file called `2`,
    which I don’t believe I have ever done on purpose.

    as the advised function. If it returns a truthy value, the advised function is
    run as usual, but if it returns `nil`, the original function is never run.

    got a personal problem, and thanks to the infinite flexibility of Emacs I was
    able to craft a personal solution in 6 lines. I wish the rest of my software were
    so flexible.'
