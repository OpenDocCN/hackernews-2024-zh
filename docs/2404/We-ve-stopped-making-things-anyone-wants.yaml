- en: Build a product, hope it provides value enough for a user to pay for it, earn
    a profit. You'd succeed by providing value. Now, we extract value.

    exit. We pull value up the stack and leave *just enough* at the bottom.

    improves it? Do *just enough* to stay out of trouble.

    We disrupt traditional industries, increase the precariousness of employment,
    strip benefits and then raise prices — but hey, you've got a new app, right?

    ([it's not](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/your-attention-is-precious/)). We do
    the same thing with everything, written, posted, produced and placed on the internet.

    to whither and then safely hollow out libraries, squeeze creators and raise prices.

    all of this, the number of people who are checked out, getting squeezed or left
    behind by vague promises that never materialize and quickly forgotten.
