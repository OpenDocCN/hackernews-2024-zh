- en: During a [teardown of the unusual pickup truck](https://twitter.com/live_munro/status/1775248021636223310)
    by automotive engineer and car expert extraordinaire Sandy Munro and his team,
    they discovered that the vehicle's massive battery pack is half empty, with tons
    of space above a layer of cylindrical, lithium-ion 4680 battery cells.

    the size of the battery pack at some point, as many fans have [since gleefully
    speculated](https://x.com/itskyleconner/status/1777710953980739604) on Elon Musk's
    social media platform? Was the EV maker concerned about the weight of the already
    hefty, 6,600-pound truck? Or was it struggling to keep the battery pack cool?
    Is the cavernous space [designed to be pressurized](https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-cybertruck-pressurize-battery-pack-water),
    potentially [enabling the truck to "wade" through water](https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-cybertruck-boat-100m)?

    an extremely bulky expansion battery pack](https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-battery-range-extender)
    that eats up a large portion of the truck's bed to push the truck's range to a
    more respectable 440 miles. It's unclear, however, if or when the extender will
    actually hit the market.

    Tesla is looking to somehow double the range of future Cybertrucks by filling
    in the empty space.

    of significantly less than 300 miles on a single charge. As [*Electrek* points
    out](https://electrek.co/2024/04/09/tesla-cybertruck-teardown-battery-pack-is-half-empty-confused/),
    its 123 kWh makes it the smallest battery pack of any electric pickup on the market.
    Was Tesla trying to save money on an [already extremely expensive-to-build](https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-actual-price)
    vehicle?

    the vehicle gets just over 200 miles on a single charge. In January, YouTube account
    Out of Specs Cybertruck [was only able to cover 254 miles](https://futurism.com/the-byte/cybertruck-real-world-range-feeble)
    on the highway, well short of the truck's EPA-rated range of 320 miles.

- en: In short, we still don't know why Tesla engineers opted to keep half of the
    battery pack of the Cybertruck empty, and all we can do at this point is make
    educated guesses. Was it an engineering compromise, a long-term design decision
    — or simply a matter of cutting costs?
