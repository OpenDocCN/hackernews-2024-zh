- en: In the 1983 movie, WarGames, Matthew Broderick’s character unwittingly hacks
    into a defence department AI system and sets off a nuclear war simulation with
    all too real consequences. The AI is designed to learn how best to respond to
    nuclear attacks but some wires get crossed and it starts wanting to play with
    real nukes. The situation is defused when it finally figures out that there are
    no winners in a nuclear free-for-all and stops the launch sequence. The computer
    realized it was playing a sucker game; one that was set up in such a way that
    it could not win.

  zh: 在1983年的电影《战争游戏》中，马修·布罗德里克饰演的角色无意中侵入了国防部的人工智能系统，并启动了一场带有极其真实后果的核战争模拟。这款人工智能的设计初衷是学习如何最佳应对核攻击，但某些线路交叉导致它开始想要玩真正的核弹。情况在最后一刻被化解，当它最终意识到在核自由斗争中没有赢家存在，并停止了发射序列。计算机意识到它在玩一个愚蠢的游戏；一个被设置得无法获胜的游戏。
- en: Sucker games are everywhere. Fortunately, most of them do not involve nukes
    but the impact on lives can still be severe. Revenge feuds are a dramatic example.
    One person hurts another leading to retaliation. The retaliation kicks off its
    own response, leading to an endless cycle of hurt benefiting no one (except perhaps
    the lawyers involved). Another example is when people go down a path that has
    ended poorly for pretty much everyone else that has taken that route. The city
    of Las Vegas is pretty much built on a burial ground of dreams like this. Sucker
    games show up in business (“I know he’s done some shady stuff before but this
    opportunity is too good to pass up”), at work (“we’d like you to take responsibility
    for this can’t-fail project even though we won’t give you the resources or time
    to get it done right”) and in love (“I’m sure I can change him”). Once you start
    looking out for them, you see them everywhere.

  zh: 愚蠢的游戏无处不在。幸运的是，大多数情况下它们不涉及核武器，但对生活的影响仍然可能非常严重。复仇的争斗就是一个鲜明的例子。一个人伤害了另一个人，引发报复。报复引发了它自己的反应，导致一个无休止的伤害循环，对任何人都没有好处（也许除了参与其中的律师）。另一个例子是当人们走上一条对大多数人来说已经失败的道路时。像拉斯维加斯这样的城市基本上是建立在这样的梦想的坟墓上。愚蠢的游戏出现在生意中（“我知道他以前做过一些可疑的事情，但这次机会太好了，无法放弃”），在工作中（“我们希望你负责这个必胜的项目，尽管我们不会给你完成得正确所需的资源或时间”）以及在爱情中（“我相信我能改变他”）。一旦你开始留意它们，你会发现它们无处不在。
- en: So why do so many seemingly rational people play games they cannot win? Why
    run headlong into a situation that is stacked against you? Is it just hubris?
    I think the primary way people get sucked in is by not realizing they have made
    the first move. Imagine you are at a bar with your friends. You accidentally bump
    into some meathead. You’re immediately apologetic but he does not stop shouting
    insults at you. You feel humiliated and start to get riled up by the unfairness
    of his reaction. You have a choice - yell back at him or apologize and walk away.
    If you chose door number 1, welcome to the sucker game of a possible bar fight.
    If you lose, you get a black eye or worse. If you win, you spend the night in
    jail. Congratulations!

  zh: 那么为什么许多看似理性的人会参与自己无法赢得的游戏呢？为什么会头脑发热地冲入一个对你不利的局面呢？这只是傲慢吗？我认为人们被吸引的主要方式是没有意识到他们已经迈出了第一步。想象一下，你和朋友们在酒吧里。你不小心撞到了一些大块头。你立刻道歉，但他却不停地辱骂你。你感到羞辱，开始被他的反应的不公平所激怒。你面临选择
    - 对他大喊大叫，还是道歉并离开。如果你选择了第一个选项，那么欢迎来到可能会打架的愚蠢游戏。如果你输了，可能会被打黑眼或更糟。如果你赢了，你可能会在监狱中度过这个夜晚。祝贺你！
- en: So how do you prevent getting into sucker games? The best case scenario is you
    have time to think before getting into the scenario. A classic example is your
    boss offering you a high-risk critical project without adequate resources or support
    and nothing more than an attaboy and a hearty slap on the back. This is called
    being set up to fail. If you are dumb, you charge forward with nothing but grit
    and optimism and join the pile of corpses of those that have died trying. If you
    are smart, you help your boss understand the risks and figure out a plan to mitigate
    them. If your boss is unwilling to face up to the challenges, then you figure
    out your plan to get out of that situation as quickly as possible. Thinking ahead
    is always a good way to anticipate and side step sucker games.

  zh: 那么，你如何避免陷入愚蠢的游戏中呢？最好的情况是，在陷入情境之前你有时间去思考。一个典型的例子是你的老板提出让你负责一个高风险的重要项目，却没有足够的资源或支持，只是一句“干得好”和一个热情的拍肩。这就是设局让你失败。如果你愚蠢，你会只凭毅力和乐观精神冲进去，然后加入那些死于尝试的人的行列。如果你聪明，你会帮助你的老板理解风险，并制定一个减轻风险的计划。如果你的老板不愿面对挑战，那么你需要尽快找到摆脱这种情况的计划。提前思考总是预见和回避愚蠢游戏的好方法。
- en: You should also get good at recognizing patterns. Have other people consistently
    failed in the same manner doing this thing? If so, perhaps some caution is called
    for. So often, people in the entertainment industry get rich and famous and then
    the “famous” part starts to mess with them. They have difficulty in relationships
    (“do they want me for me or what I can do for them?”) and their insecurities take
    on a new life. If you are trying to make it in show business, you should proactively
    spend some time figuring out your mental health given the well documented stresses
    that come with the industry. There is a similar pattern with people in sports
    and finances (or lack thereof in their post-career lives). If you pay attention,
    you will spot the patterns for the environment you are in regardless of whether
    you are a school teacher, stay at-home parent or rock-and-roll god.

  zh: 你还应该擅长识别模式。其他人在做这件事时是否一直以同样的方式失败？如果是这样，也许需要多加小心。在娱乐行业，人们常常变得富有和出名，然后“出名”部分开始困扰他们。他们在人际关系上有困难（“他们是因为喜欢我本人还是因为我能为他们做什么？”），而且他们的不安全感变得更加严重。如果你正试图在演艺界取得成功，你应该主动花一些时间了解自己的心理健康状况，因为这个行业带来的压力是众所周知的。与此类似的模式也存在于体育和财务（或是事业后生活中的缺乏）的人群中。只要你留心观察，无论你是学校教师、全职家庭主妇还是摇滚乐天王，你都能发现所处环境中的模式。
- en: So what happens if you find yourself already in a sucker game? What now? The
    good news is that you recognize your predicament. You have looked at the path
    you are on and realized it is not going to end well. The first rule of holes is
    that when you find yourself in one, stop digging. The hard part is realizing that
    any new investment in that game is making you worse off and you need to stop and
    change course right now. This takes effort and very often a sublimation of your
    ego. Sometimes what it takes is an apology, even when you are not totally wrong.
    Even the Good Book suggests that if you realize you are in a feud with someone,
    you are better off skipping church to find the person and make amends. This is
    not to suggest becoming a doormat but also not to be driven by your ego, blind
    ambition or attachment to sunk costs.

  zh: 那么，如果你发现自己已经陷入了愚蠢的游戏中怎么办？现在怎么办？好消息是你意识到了自己的困境。你审视了你走的路，意识到这条路不会有好结果。挖坑的第一法则是，当你发现自己在坑里时，停止挖掘。困难的是意识到在那场游戏中的任何新投入都会使你变得更糟，并且你需要立即停止并改变方向。这需要努力，往往还需要抑制你的自我。有时候，即使你并不完全错，你也需要道歉。即使《圣经》也建议，如果你意识到自己和某人有矛盾，你最好跳过教堂去找这个人并进行和解。这并不是建议成为一块门垫，但也不要被你的自我、盲目的野心或对沉没成本的执着驱使。
- en: The reality of life is you almost cannot avoid being drawn into a sucker game
    every now and then. The best you can do is to reduce your exposure to them and
    reduce your time spent playing them. The more you practice, the better you will
    get at spotting them and minimizing the damage they cause.
