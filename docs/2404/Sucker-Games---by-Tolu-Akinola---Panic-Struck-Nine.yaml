- en: In the 1983 movie, WarGames, Matthew Broderick’s character unwittingly hacks
    into a defence department AI system and sets off a nuclear war simulation with
    all too real consequences. The AI is designed to learn how best to respond to
    nuclear attacks but some wires get crossed and it starts wanting to play with
    real nukes. The situation is defused when it finally figures out that there are
    no winners in a nuclear free-for-all and stops the launch sequence. The computer
    realized it was playing a sucker game; one that was set up in such a way that
    it could not win.

    but the impact on lives can still be severe. Revenge feuds are a dramatic example.
    One person hurts another leading to retaliation. The retaliation kicks off its
    own response, leading to an endless cycle of hurt benefiting no one (except perhaps
    the lawyers involved). Another example is when people go down a path that has
    ended poorly for pretty much everyone else that has taken that route. The city
    of Las Vegas is pretty much built on a burial ground of dreams like this. Sucker
    games show up in business (“I know he’s done some shady stuff before but this
    opportunity is too good to pass up”), at work (“we’d like you to take responsibility
    for this can’t-fail project even though we won’t give you the resources or time
    to get it done right”) and in love (“I’m sure I can change him”). Once you start
    looking out for them, you see them everywhere.

- en: So why do so many seemingly rational people play games they cannot win? Why
    run headlong into a situation that is stacked against you? Is it just hubris?
    I think the primary way people get sucked in is by not realizing they have made
    the first move. Imagine you are at a bar with your friends. You accidentally bump
    into some meathead. You’re immediately apologetic but he does not stop shouting
    insults at you. You feel humiliated and start to get riled up by the unfairness
    of his reaction. You have a choice - yell back at him or apologize and walk away.
    If you chose door number 1, welcome to the sucker game of a possible bar fight.
    If you lose, you get a black eye or worse. If you win, you spend the night in
    jail. Congratulations!

- en: So how do you prevent getting into sucker games? The best case scenario is you
    have time to think before getting into the scenario. A classic example is your
    boss offering you a high-risk critical project without adequate resources or support
    and nothing more than an attaboy and a hearty slap on the back. This is called
    being set up to fail. If you are dumb, you charge forward with nothing but grit
    and optimism and join the pile of corpses of those that have died trying. If you
    are smart, you help your boss understand the risks and figure out a plan to mitigate
    them. If your boss is unwilling to face up to the challenges, then you figure
    out your plan to get out of that situation as quickly as possible. Thinking ahead
    is always a good way to anticipate and side step sucker games.

    failed in the same manner doing this thing? If so, perhaps some caution is called
    for. So often, people in the entertainment industry get rich and famous and then
    the “famous” part starts to mess with them. They have difficulty in relationships
    (“do they want me for me or what I can do for them?”) and their insecurities take
    on a new life. If you are trying to make it in show business, you should proactively
    spend some time figuring out your mental health given the well documented stresses
    that come with the industry. There is a similar pattern with people in sports
    and finances (or lack thereof in their post-career lives). If you pay attention,
    you will spot the patterns for the environment you are in regardless of whether
    you are a school teacher, stay at-home parent or rock-and-roll god.

- en: So what happens if you find yourself already in a sucker game? What now? The
    good news is that you recognize your predicament. You have looked at the path
    you are on and realized it is not going to end well. The first rule of holes is
    that when you find yourself in one, stop digging. The hard part is realizing that
    any new investment in that game is making you worse off and you need to stop and
    change course right now. This takes effort and very often a sublimation of your
    ego. Sometimes what it takes is an apology, even when you are not totally wrong.
    Even the Good Book suggests that if you realize you are in a feud with someone,
    you are better off skipping church to find the person and make amends. This is
    not to suggest becoming a doormat but also not to be driven by your ego, blind
    ambition or attachment to sunk costs.

    every now and then. The best you can do is to reduce your exposure to them and
    reduce your time spent playing them. The more you practice, the better you will
    get at spotting them and minimizing the damage they cause.
