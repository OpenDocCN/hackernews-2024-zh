    new code does input buffer bounds checking only once per loop iteration, checking
    that there is at least 21 bytes available. At first this may look insufficient
    because, in the worst case, `rc_normalize` may be executed up to 48 times (22
    bit model + 26 direct) per loop iteration. Each `rc_normalize` macro will read
    one input byte if needed. However, the condition to read a new byte cannot be
    true everytime. This has been verified both with math and experimentally. Comments
    in the code about this could be improved.

    The next commit by me ([liblzma: LZMA decoder improvements.](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/e0c0ee475c0800c08291ae45e0d66aa00d5ce604))
    made the non-resumable variant jump to the safe code (`goto eopm`) instead and
    thus 21 was changed to 20.'

    correct because it is added among several other .m4 files when running `./autogen.sh`
    or `autoreconf -fi`.

    the test to match isn’t much extra to do.

    Almost always it’s not good to touch the translations without upstream approval.
    In this case I felt mixed as I wondered if the date translations would be correct
    but didn’t want to stop it so that the translation could be in the 5.6.1 release
    that was going to be made the same day.'
