    database that tracks the ownership of the data within its economy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the network to operate effectively, many participants must retain and sync
    their copies of the database and agree that those copies are without discrepancies.
    Otherwise, like the electronic currencies of old, there is a risk that a user
    might be able to allocate data they don’t own or didn’t earn – fraudulently creating
    new coins and issuing them into circulation.

    Crucially, however, Bitcoin’s barriers are not the product of the protocol, but
    of market forces. Any user who wants to secure the database can do so by finding
    access to electricity and computing power. Any user who wants to verify the database
    can do so by downloading and storing its ledger.

    functions. Some allocate the ability to determine their cost to specific users,
    allowing the users that secure the database to dictate that their peers hold a
    certain amount of the cryptocurrency, or to meet some other criteria they dictate
    in order to receive the cryptocurrency.
