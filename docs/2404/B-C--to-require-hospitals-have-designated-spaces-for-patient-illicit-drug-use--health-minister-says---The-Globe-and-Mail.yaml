    overdoses. The Globe and Mail asked Mr. Dix Thursday whether every hospital in
    [B.C.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/british-columbia/) would be required
    to follow suit. “That is the purpose of the effort – not just to standardize rules,”
    he said.

    issues use B.C. health care facilities. “The idea that people who are severely
    addicted and, say, are involved in some incident which leaves them injured and
    requires admission to a hospital, are going to take that moment to simply not
    deal with their addictions is just not correct,” he said.

    it an outlier in the country. B.C. is the only jurisdiction in Canada to decriminalize
