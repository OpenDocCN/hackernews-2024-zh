- en: CaliExpress by Flippy claims to be the world’s first fully autonomous restaurant,
    using a system of AI-powered robots to churn out fast-food burgers and fries.
    A small number of humans are still required to push the buttons on the machines
    and assemble the burgers and toppings, but the companies involved tout that using
    their technology could cut labor costs, perhaps dramatically. “Eat the future,”
    they offer.

    were other journalists. A television crew hovered over the grill machine.

    “test kitchen” for the future of fast-food technology. The machine for making
    the burgers is produced by Cucina, a company focused on automating food production,
    which described its “BurgerChef” as a solution to a “65% increase in food service
    wages in the past 15 years”. The french fry-making robot, Flippy, was created
    by Miso Robotics, a local startup founded by a group of Caltech grads.

    stages of my order. She pushed a button on a nearby screen. The BurgerChef ground
    a single burger’s worth of wagyu steak to order and then squeezed it out from
    a tube and tucked it between two metal plates to brown. One hundred and ninety-five
    seconds later, a plastic arm rotated to receive the browned burger, ultimately
    dropping the meat into a waiting container.

    oil, and we waited.

    hence the name, Rob Anderson, one of the co-founders of Miso Robotics, told me
    later. But manning a grill – keeping track of burgers and cheese and buns and
    onions, and being able to flip the different objects at the proper time – turned
    out to be a tremendously sophisticated robotics problem, one too tricky for the
    startup to tackle, he said. So they decided to pivot to a simpler challenge: making
    a robot that could manage a frying station, what Anderson argued was “probably
    the most stressful and dangerous tasks in the kitchen” for human workers, and
    thus a good task for a robot, which would not be burned by hot oil or bothered
    by the heat.'

    tasks, such as adjusting to differently sized kitchens and ranges. It also had

    intelligence that uses machine learning and neural networks to allow computers
    to act on visual inputs, like photos or videos, in the way that humans respond
    to sight. Flippy’s computer vision was continuously monitoring where the fry baskets
    were placed, so if a human worker replaced one in a slightly different spot, the
    machine would simply adjust.

    onion rings, and could detect when onions had been place inside the fryer, rather

    also informed the robot’s “scheduling and forecasting” abilities, like deciding
    “what is the right order to cook all this food so it’s still cooked perfectly”
    during the lunch hour rush or slower times in the afternoon.'

    or repairs. Flippy could not clean itself: it needed wipe-downs every night, and
    more intensive cleanings monthly and quarterly. Human employees could also do
    “more customer engagement work”, he said. “You don’t just have to sit there and
    monitor a fryer.”'
