    or to have a co-founder to get an O1 visa. You can be scrappy, a solo founder,
    and bootstrap.
  prefs: []

- en: Unlike visas like the TN or the HB1, which have restrictions on the title you
    can have (no founder or CTO), your wages (really high salaries), and where you
    work, the O1 is founder-friendly and a stepping stone to the green card with the
    EB1\. It’s the fastest, most flexible way to live in the US and build a startup
    with unlimited extensions.

    In a startup context, that doesn’t mean you need a co-founder. A way folks have
    done this is by having a board with at least three people, even including yourself,
    to demonstrate your role has some level of hire-fire authority.
