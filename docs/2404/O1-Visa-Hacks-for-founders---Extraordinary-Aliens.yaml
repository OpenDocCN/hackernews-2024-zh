    or to have a co-founder to get an O1 visa. You can be scrappy, a solo founder,
    and bootstrap.

    can have (no founder or CTO), your wages (really high salaries), and where you
    work, the O1 is founder-friendly and a stepping stone to the green card with the
    EB1\. It’s the fastest, most flexible way to live in the US and build a startup
    with unlimited extensions.

    In a startup context, that doesn’t mean you need a co-founder. A way folks have
    done this is by having a board with at least three people, even including yourself,
    to demonstrate your role has some level of hire-fire authority.
