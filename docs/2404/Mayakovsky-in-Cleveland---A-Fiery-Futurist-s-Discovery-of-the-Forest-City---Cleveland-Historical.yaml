- en: In the fateful year of 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution shook Russia and forever
    changed the world. Its impact left an indelible mark not only on the political
    history of the 20th century, but also on art, culture, film, and literature. Perhaps
    one of the greatest exponents of the new Russian Revolutionary zeitgeist was the
    poet, playwright, and artist Vladimir Mayakovsky, whose thunderous verse and visually
    arresting Cubo-Futurist agitprop shook the world as much as the history that surrounded
    him.

  zh: 在命运般的1917年，俄国十月革命震撼了俄罗斯，并永远改变了世界。它的影响不仅深深刻在20世纪的政治历史上，还涉及到艺术、文化、电影和文学。也许新俄国革命时期最伟大的代表之一是诗人、剧作家和艺术家弗拉基米尔·马雅可夫斯基，他那雷鸣般的诗句和视觉冲击力十足的立体未来派宣传震撼了世界，正如他周围的历史一样。
- en: It was in 1925 that the poet brought his gospel of revolutionary futurism to
    the working class of the great urban centers of America, including Cleveland.
    He was not the first prominent Russian to visit the Forest City – Anna Pavlova,
    Sergei Diaghilev, Vaslav Nijinsky, Feodor Chaliapin, and Sergei Yesenin had already
    beat him to the punch. However, Mayakovsky’s visit would stand as one of the more
    significant, underscoring Cleveland’s position not only as a fast-growing and
    densely populated industrial metropolis, but also as a hotbed for left-wing labor
    activism.

  zh: 1925年，这位诗人将他的革命未来主义福音带到了包括克利夫兰在内的美国大城市的工人阶级中。他不是第一个访问森林城市的显赫俄国人物——安娜·帕夫洛娃、谢尔盖·达吉利耶夫、瓦斯拉夫·涅金斯基、费奥多尔·夏利亚平和谢尔盖·叶谢宁已经率先到达。然而，马雅可夫斯基的访问被视为其中较为重要的之一，突显了克利夫兰不仅是一个快速发展和人口密集的工业大都市，而且是左翼劳工活动的温床。
- en: Mayakovsky was born on July 19, 1893, to a Russian family in Baghdati, Georgia,
    near the city of Kutaisi, then part of the Imperial Russian Caucasus. The family
    later moved to Moscow where the rebellious Mayakovsky became increasingly drawn
    to the ideals of revolutionary socialism and Marxism. In March 1908, when he was
    not yet 15, he was arrested for the first time for possessing radical literature
    in a police raid on an underground printing house.

  zh: 马雅可夫斯基生于1893年7月19日，出生在格鲁吉亚库塔伊市附近的巴格达蒂，那时是俄罗斯帝国高加索地区的一部分。后来，家庭搬到了莫斯科，在那里，反叛的马雅可夫斯基逐渐倾向于革命社会主义和马克思主义理想。1908年3月，还不到15岁的他因在一次对地下印刷厂的警察突袭中持有激进文学作品而首次被捕。
- en: In 1911, Mayakovsky was admitted to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture
    and Architecture. It was there, under the influence of the futurist artist David
    Burliuk, that he embraced poetry as his full-time passion and indeed, his fate.
    Then, only few years later, in 1915, the poet met his great love and muse, Lilya
    Brik. However, for the restless revolutionary, she was one of many women with
    whom he was passionately involved.

  zh: 1911年，马雅可夫斯基被莫斯科绘画、雕塑和建筑学校录取。在那里，在未来派艺术家大卫·布尔留克的影响下，他将诗歌视为自己的全职热情和命运。仅仅几年后的1915年，诗人遇见了他的真爱和灵感来源莉亚·布里克。然而，对于不安分的革命者来说，她只是他热情涉足的众多女性之一。
- en: In 1917, Mayakovsky became an eyewitness to the revolutionary events in Petrograd
    and “entered the revolution as one would enter his own home,” in the words of
    the writer Viktor Shklovsky. Plunging headlong into the new revolutionary fervor
    sweeping the arts, Mayakovsky soon became a favorite with the Russian public,
    a status solidified by his authorship of the epic poem *150,000,000*. He collaborated
    with many Russian artists and writers in the period of Lenin’s New Economic Policy
    (NEP), most prominently the great graphic artist and photographer Aleksandr Rodchenko
    and the celebrated avant-gardist El Lissitzky. The poet also rose to renown as
    a prominent member of LEF, the Left Art Front. Meanwhile, Lenin’s own taste in
    art was more conservative in comparison, and the Soviet leader himself even referred
    to Mayakovsky, in a tongue-in-cheek way, as a “hooligan communist.”

  zh: 1917年，马雅可夫斯基成为彼得罗格勒革命事件的目击者，“如同进入自己家一般参加了革命”，用作家维克托·舍克洛夫斯基的话来形容。他迅速投入新的革命热潮席卷的艺术领域，很快成为俄罗斯公众的宠儿，这一地位因其史诗诗歌《150,000,000》的创作而巩固。在列宁的新经济政策（NEP）时期，他与许多俄罗斯艺术家和作家合作，其中最著名的是伟大的图形艺术家和摄影师亚历山大·罗德琴科以及著名的先锋派艺术家埃尔·利西茨基。作为“左翼艺术前线”（LEF）的重要成员，诗人也因此声名大噪。与此同时，与列宁本人相比，列宁在艺术上的品味更为保守，苏联领导人甚至戏称马雅可夫斯基是一个“混球共产党员”。
- en: The thunderous Mayakovsky soon sought to preach his revolutionary futurism abroad,
    traveling to France, Cuba, Mexico (where he dined with muralist Diego Rivera),
    and eventually the United States. In the latter, Mayakovsky traveled to the great
    urban centers of the Northeast and the Great Lakes – New York, Cleveland, Detroit,
    Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. In all these cities, he sought to bring
    his revolutionary gospel to the tired, poor, and huddled working masses of America.
    He also planned a stop in Boston that was ultimately unrealized. On the side,
    he engaged in a passionate romantic affair with Russian émigré Elly Jones and
    had just enough time for a reunion with his mentor Burliuk, who was then living
    in the Bronx. In Manhattan, the Russian Mayakovsky even reportedly surprised one
    of his audiences by addressing them in Georgian, a language that he picked up
    in his youth.

  zh: 这位雷鸣般的马雅可夫斯基很快就希望将他的革命未来主义传道士精神传播到国外，他游历到法国、古巴、墨西哥（在那里与壁画家迭戈·里韦拉共进晚餐）和最终美国。在美国，马雅可夫斯基游历了东北部和五大湖地区的大城市，如纽约、克利夫兰、底特律、芝加哥、匹兹堡和费城。在所有这些城市中，他都试图将他的革命福音带给疲惫、贫困和聚集在美国的工人群众。他还计划访问波士顿，但最终未能实现。此外，他还与俄罗斯移民埃莉·琼斯展开了一段激情四溢的浪漫恋情，并抽出时间与他的导师布尔留克在布朗克斯区团聚。据报道，这位俄罗斯人在曼哈顿甚至以格鲁吉亚语（他年轻时学会的一种语言）向其中一群听众致辞，令人惊讶。
- en: Mayakovsky fell in love with New York and the city left the greatest impression
    on the poet. However, he was also spellbound by urban Americana in general, expressing
    at once admiration and disgust with what he observed in his later account, *Moe
    otkrytie Ameriki* (My Discovery of America). Cleveland, then America's fifth largest
    city and fast approaching a population of one million people, was to be the poet’s
    first stop after the Big Apple. There the poet spoke on September 29, 1925, at
    8 PM at the Carpenters’ Union Hall at 2226 East 55th in the Cedar–Central neighborhood,
    in the shadow of the city’s downtown. The event was sponsored by the Russian and
    Jewish departments of the Workers Party of America (an earlier name for the Communist
    Party USA). Admission was 50 cents.

  zh: 马雅可夫斯基深爱纽约，这座城市给他留下了最深刻的印象。然而，他也对美国的城市风光深感迷醉，他在后来的著作《我的发现美国》中既表达了对观察到的美国城市生活的钦佩，也表达了他的厌恶。克利夫兰，当时是美国第五大城市，快速接近一百万人口，成为这位诗人在大苹果之后的第一站。在这里，他于1925年9月29日晚上8点在2226
    East 55th的Carpenters' Union Hall发表讲话，这个地方位于城市市中心的阴影下，属于Cedar–Central社区。此次活动由美国工人党（共产党美国前身）的俄罗斯和犹太部门赞助，门票售价为50美分。
- en: 'A Russian-language blurb in the New York-based paper *Novyi Mir* announced
    the Cleveland event as follows: “Hey Clevelander, listen up! The theatre is not
    going anywhere! The movies are not going anywhere! Your acquaintances are not
    going anywhere! But MAYAKOVSKY will be departing for the USSR. However, before
    he leaves, he will be visiting CLEVELAND.” The advertisement advised readers not
    to miss Mayakovsky’s appearance at the hall, noting that the poet would be delivering
    both a poetry recitation and a lecture. Similarly, the leftist Jewish newspaper
    *Freigait* noted that Mayakovsky would be reciting "his best works with his usual

    广告建议读者不要错过马雅可夫斯基在大厅的露面，指出诗人将进行诗歌朗诵和讲座。 同样，左翼犹太报纸*Freigait*指出，马雅可夫斯基将以他的惯常技艺朗诵“他最好的作品”。
- en: On September 26, *The Daily Worker* further noted that not only was Mayakovsky
    to give a “proletarian culture lecture,” but that he would also update the audience
    on the latest avant-garde trends in Soviet literature. The blurb also emphasized
    that “all Russian speaking workers” were invited to attend the event. Naturally,
    there were many individuals fitting this description in Cleveland, which at the
    time boasted a foreign-born population of 30%. Moreover, the political upheavals
    of the First Red Scare would have still been fresh in the minds of many Clevelanders,

    当时，克利夫兰有着30%的外籍人口，自然而然地，许多人符合这一描述。 此外，第一次红色恐慌的政治动荡在克利夫兰市的许多人心中仍然历历在目，包括1919年的激进[五一节暴动](https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/28)。 '
- en: Unfortunately for today’s historians, Mayakovsky’s visit was not covered in
    the major Cleveland newspapers, and no account of his Forest City recitation has
    been preserved. The Carpenters’ Union Hall where Mayakovsky spoke was a large
    building that originally housed the Fraternal Order of Eagles in Cleveland. By
    1924, the ownership had changed, and the structure was purchased by the Local
    1750 United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and became the Jewish Carpenters’
    Union Hall. Its patrons were not exclusively Jewish and radical activists from
    other ethnic groups also advertised events held at the venue. In September 1925,
    for example, the Cleveland-based Czech socialist paper *Americké dělnické listy*
    advertised the visit of British Labour politician Rennie Smith at the hall. The
    venue also hosted sporting events, including the early basketball tournaments
    of the Cleveland Rosenblums, the city’s first major basketball team.

    Union Hall，这是一座大楼，最初是兄弟鹰会在克利夫兰的分部。 到1924年，所有权发生变化，该建筑被购买并成为Local 1750 United Brotherhood
    of Carpenters and Joiners的犹太木匠工会大厅。 其客户并非 exclusively Jewish，来自其他族裔的激进活动家也在该场所举办活动。
    例如，1925年9月，克利夫兰的捷克社会主义报纸*Americké dělnické listy*在该厅宣传英国工党政治家Rennie Smith的访问。
    该场地还举办了体育赛事，包括克利夫兰Rosenblums早期的篮球锦标赛，该队是该市的第一个主要篮球队。

    “Cotton Club,” hosting popular jazz orchestras, such as those of Don Redman and
    Fletcher Henderson. By the late 1940s, the building was rebranded again as “Paradise
    Auditorium.” In 1949 and again in 1952, singer and civil rights activist Paul
    Robeson performed there, and in October 1965, future Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes,

    in Cleveland" (*Nebyvaloe v Klivlende*), which is now held at the State Literature
    Museum of Russia in Moscow. He also left us with his impressions of the 1920s
    skyscraper boom that swept up urban America, including Cleveland. “All America,
    and New York in particular, is under construction, under interminable construction,”
    he wrote in his *Discovery of America*. “Ten-storey buildings are pulled apart

- en: As an example of this high-rise fever, Mayakovsky noted that just as he began
    to “react with a sort of poetic inspiration to some twenty-storey Cleveland hotel,”
    locals began complaining that the building’s placement was “crowding us,” like
    commuters on a streetcar. “And so, they’re just relocating it, ten blocks away,
    to the lake,” Mayakovsky wrote, incredulously. “I don’t know precisely who will
    be relocating this building, or how, but if a thing like that slips from their
    hands, it will trample a lot of corns.”

- en: Mayakovsky’s passage invites some curiosity. At the time of his visit, a prominent
    twenty-story Cleveland hotel was indeed under construction and close to completion
    – the Cleveland Allerton, at the corner of Chester and East 13th. That hotel was
    officially opened the following year, in November 1926\. However, the futurist’s
    claim about the proposed relocation of the high-rise structure to the Lake Erie
    shore was undoubtedly an exaggeration and most certainly the result of a misunderstanding.

- en: In a passage that Mayakovsky later cut from the final edition of his work, he
    also condemned the conditions of poor African American families living in abject
    poverty alongside the streetcar line on Cleveland’s Near East Side.  He identified
    them as workers from the “Rockefeller oil refineries” living in shanty towns in
    what he described as an “immense ditch” and “without any hope, under the current
    American conditions, to climb into something better.”  Writing of the inequality
    facing these men and women, the working poor of America, he remarked, “the small
