- en: If you asked a lawyer whether ChatGPT could do his job, he would laugh you out
    of the room. The tool is often useful, but can’t handle legal questions end to
    end. It makes up sources, its reasoning can be flawed, and it may overlook key
    aspects of the law.

    iterating multiple times, implementing advanced agentic workflows, and testing
    with dozens of lawyers, we’re certain that the product has glaring limitations
    and it won’t replace any jobs soon. However, we figured out an unintuitive, LLM-only
    method of doing RAG, and we leveraged it to make LLMs answer complex questions
    about select EU regulations.

    with answering a legal question based on the pre-generated plan. It can delegate
    subquestions to “junior lawyers” - in fact, separate GPT-4 chats - by calling
    [functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

    III,” we know which pages to put into the “junior lawyer’s” prompt. This is the

- en: Compared to analyzing the entire AI Act, GPT-4’s reasoning is massively boosted
    when it’s given a clear task and a short context. With a 5k-token-long prompt,
    you can even usually trust the LLM to correctly quote the source, which is useful
    to a user verifying the final answer.

    calls functions, going through the plan step by step. Eventually, after all subquestions
    are answered, it outputs the final answer in a format we can detect with a regex.
    We then break the loop and return the answer to the user.

    well but often can’t answer them correctly. In non-trivial scenarios, it makes
    logical errors.^([2](#user-content-fn-logic))
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lawyers also told us that when they answer a question, they rarely touch upon
    a single regulation. Not only do they analyze multiple regulations, but they also
    take into account supporting documents such as various guidelines, regulatory
    technical standards, and court rulings. In contrast, this system can only process
    a single document at a time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    document scope kills usage. No lawyer wants to expend effort to ask a detailed
    question, wait 10 minutes for an answer, wade through a 2-pages-long response,
    and find that the AI made an error.
