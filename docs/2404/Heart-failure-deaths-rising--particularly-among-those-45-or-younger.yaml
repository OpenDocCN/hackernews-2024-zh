- en: Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition in which the heart’s ability
    to squeeze and then pump blood throughout the body weakens. Two main types are
    defined by a measure called ejection fraction. When the heart relaxes after squeezing
    normally, it’s known as reduced ejection fraction; when it doesn’t relax afterward,
    it’s known as preserved ejection fraction. Symptoms can be the same for both groups,
    split roughly in half, but more medications are effective in treating symptoms
    for those with reduced than preserved ejection fraction.

- en: Over the time period covered in the JAMA Cardiology paper, doctors have gotten
    better at recognizing heart failure, Fudim and the other experts told STAT. Better
    testing perhaps contributed to increased heart failure diagnoses, reflected in
    the dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which the analysis
    was based. More people are surviving heart attacks now, so more people are living
    long enough to develop heart failure, which could explain higher prevalence in
    recent years.

    in death rates coinciding with Covid could mean people sick enough to be hospitalized
