    to reduce noise. Saw sshd processes were using a surprising amount of CPU, despite
    immediately failing because of wrong usernames etc. Profiled sshd, showing lots
    of cpu time in liblzma, with perf unable to attribute it to a symbol. Got suspicious.
    Recalled that I had seen an odd valgrind complaint in automated testing of postgres,
    a few weeks earlier, after package updates.

    them with valgrind. For some other test instance I had used -fno-omit-frame-pointer
    for some reason I do not remember. A year or so ago I moved all the test instances
    to a common base configuration, instead of duplicate configurations. I chose to
    make all of them use -fno-omit-frame-pointer.

    It was because _get_cpuid() expected the stack frame to look a certain way.

    vulnerable as I wouldn’t even see a speed issue. For me, it was a completely transparent
    backdoor — where sshd was running from disk as usual, with the usual file hash
    and no extra network activity.

    one, with a very high bar of knowledge, research, development and tradecraft to
    reach this far into the Linux ecosystem. Additionally, changes made by the threat
    actor on Github span multiple years, and include things like introducing functions
    incompatible with OSS Fuzzer due to outstanding small issues since 2015, then
    getting OSS Fuzzer to exclude XZ Utils from scanning last year. The backdoor itself
    is super well put together, and even includes the ability to remotely deactivate
    and remove the backdoor via a kill command. Several days in, despite global focus,
    I haven’t seen anybody who has finished reverse engineering it.'

    to all systemd servies, which opens a rich attack surface of third party services
    to backdoor. That is what the threat actor abused here. It mean they didn’t need
    to backdoor systemd, which has a rich development community paying attention —
    instead they relied on liblzma loading XZ, which is much further down the chain,
    where nobody was paying attention.

    and long before the Github issue. The fix stopped the XZ backdoor into SSH, but

    accelerated development and deployment, hence publicly filing bug reports to try
    to get Ubuntu and such to upgrade XZ, as it was about to spoil several years of
    work. It also appears this is when they started making mistakes.

    There’s probably more that needs to be done around EDR detection on Linux, e.g.
    injection into ssh that nobody detected? Detect it. In truth, Linux EDR products
    are significantly less robust than Windows EDR products. Ask me how I know.

    face significant amounts of online abuse from users of the software. This is not
    the first time an open source package has been hijacked after a maintainer was
    added – it actually happens all the time in Python repositories and such, and
    has been one of the leading causes of infostealers and coin miners in development
    pipelines. It is absolutely not a surprise that somebody is targeting open source
    compression libraries that systemd loads.. and it is also sadly not a surprise
    that people online bully the creators of these libraries, either.
