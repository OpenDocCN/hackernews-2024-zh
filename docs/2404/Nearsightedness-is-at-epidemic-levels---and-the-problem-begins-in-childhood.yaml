    has become a lot more common in recent decades. [Some even consider myopia](https://doi.org/10.1038/519276a),
    also known as nearsightedness, an epidemic.

    [there’s no single myopia gene](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-8491-2_5).

    visual development in infant chickens](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-perception-in-the-chick/).
    They do so by putting little helmets on baby chickens. Lenses on the face of the
    helmet cover the chicks’ eyes and are adjusted to affect how much they see.

    [resulting in myopia](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.065). And it’s progressive.
    Blur leads to eye growth, which causes more blur, which makes the eye grow even
    larger, and so on.

    provide strong support for the idea that an [important driver of the uptick](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14377-1)
    in myopia is that [people are spending more time](https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14980)
    focusing on objects immediately in front of our eyes, whether a screen, a book
    or a drawing pad. The more time we spend focusing on something within arm’s length
    of our faces, dubbed “near work,” the greater the odds of having myopia.

    greater](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14377-1) for children who didn’t spend
    much time outdoors – say, once or twice a week – compared with those who were
    outside daily. At the same time, kids who spent more than three hours a day while
    not at school reading or looking at a screen close-up were four times more likely
    to have myopia than those who spent an hour or less doing so.

    of time spent outdoors with myopia incidence. They also found that more time spent

    which is why early vision testing and vision correction are important to limit
    the development of myopia. Eye checks for children are mandatory in some countries,
