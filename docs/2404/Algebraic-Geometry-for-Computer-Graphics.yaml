- en: James F. Blinn  Computer graphicists model shapes with polynomials. Simple linear
    polynomials generate flat polygons; higher order polynomials generate curved lines
    and surfaces. In order to develop algorithms for modeling and rendering such shapes
    we must have an intimate understanding of how the coefficients of the polynomials
    relate to the geometric shapes they generate. The answers to various geometric
    questions are expressed in terms of new polynomials built out of the coefficients
    of the original polynomial. The problem is that, for fairly simple shapes, these
    new polynomials can get incredibly complicated. For example, the condition that
    a cubic curve has a double point results in a test expression that is a 12^(th) 
    order polynomial in the cubic’s coefficients, and this test expression has over
    10000 terms! Fortunately there is a better way to deal with this problem. The
    research I am doing builds on a graphical notation technique that was originally
    proposed by Sylvester and Clifford over 100 years ago. I have been translating
    many of the results of classical algebraic geometry into this notation. This has
    led to a much better visualization of the relation between a polynomial’s shape
    and its coefficients and has produced new algorithms for solving and factoring
    polynomials. My ultimate goal is a new catalog of all the interesting algebraic
    relations between polynomial coefficients and their shape, describing curves and
    surfaces of orders up to 4 or 5 in a way that their processing can be accurately
    computed by parallel processors such as modern GPU’s.

- en: Algebraic Geometry as studied by Mathematicians often deals with very abstract
    and general issues that I admit that I don’t completely understand myself. Instead,
    my talks will focus on that subset of Algebraic Geometry that I find most relevant
    to computer graphics. They will only require a knowledge of simple linear algebra
    and homogeneous coordinates. I am still researching some of the topics so the
    presentation will show open questions as well as answers.

    So far I have been working “bottom up” by building up elementary structures of
    more and more complexity. This time I will start “top down” with a more complex
    goal: Determining when and where Bezier curves have loops, and work toward the
    tensor diagram structures that answer this question. People who have missed a
    few lectures should still be able to get something useful from this talk. I will
    finish by teasing some of the more advanced things we might get into if there
    is interest in continuing this next term.'

    functional determinants, syzygies, and polynomial division. We can then find our
    missing invariant that allows us to completely categorize the space of equivalence
    classes. And we will see an amusing relation between 2x2 matrices in P1 and 3D

    P¹. First I will show the (simpler) form that tensor diagrams take in this space
    and show how they generate some basic identities. In P¹, 2x2 matrices are used
    to represent quadratic polynomials and to represent linear transforms. The different
    transformation properties of these matrices lead to different internal structures.
    I will show various visualizations of these properties and how they lead to some
    exercises in projective thinking. These will form the foundations of generalization
    to higher dimensions and higher order polynomials.

- en: Springer 1977\.  Jim Blinn made his first computer generated pictures in 1968
    while an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. From 1974 to 1977 he was
    a graduate student at the University of Utah where he did research in realistic
    rendering. The results of this research have become standard techniques in today’s
    computer animation systems. They include realistic specular lighting models, bump
    mapping and environment/reflection mapping. In 1977 he received a Ph.D. and moved
    to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he produced computer graphics animations
    for various space missions to Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. These animations were
    shown on many news broadcasts as part of the press coverage of the missions and
    were the first exposure to computer animation for many people in the industry
    today. Also at JPL he produced animation for the PBS series COSMOS and for the
    Annenberg/CPB funded project “The Mechanical Universe”, a 52 part telecourse to
    teach college level physics. During these productions he developed several other
    standard computer graphics techniques including work in cloud simulation and a
    modeling technique variously called blobbies or metaballs. From 1989 to 1995 he
    worked at Caltech producing animations to teach High School mathematics for “Project
    Mathematics!” From 1987 to 2007 he had a regular column called *Jim Blinn’s Corner*
    in the IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications journal where he described mathematical
    techniques used in computer graphics. These have been collected into three books.
    From 1995 to 2009 he worked at Microsoft Research as a Graphics Fellow developing
    a new mathematical notation scheme that greatly simplifies the algebraic description
    and manipulation of curves and surfaces. He is currently retired
