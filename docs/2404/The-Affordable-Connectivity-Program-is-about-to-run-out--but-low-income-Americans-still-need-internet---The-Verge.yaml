- en: Congress empowered the FCC to take on the important work of ensuring “all people
    of the United States” have access to an evolving level of communications services.
    That goal, termed “universal service,” is primarily pursued through the Universal
    Service Fund (USF), which Congress created as part of the Telecommunications Act
    of 1996\. The USF is financed by a fee imposed on certain revenues for traditional
    telephone services. Consumers who purchase such services typically see a line
    item on their bill for a “universal service fee.” As Congress envisioned, the
    USF has advanced from supporting one essential communications network, telephone
    service, to supporting the essential communications network of our time, broadband
    internet.

  zh: 国会授权FCC承担重要工作，确保“美国所有人民”都能够获得日益发展的通信服务水平。这一目标，称为“普遍服务”，主要通过1996年电信法案的一部分——通信法，实现。美国通信基金的资金来源是对传统电话服务的某些收入征收的费用。购买这类服务的消费者通常会在账单上看到“通用服务费”的项目。正如国会设想的那样，美国通信基金已从支持一个基本的通信网络——电话服务，发展为支持我们时代的基本通信网络——宽带互联网。

- en: The approximately $8 billion the USF spends annually to help close the digital
    divide has funded connectivity to rural, tribal, and remote areas that were deemed
    “uneconomic to serve.” It has provided access for schoolchildren and library patrons,
    many of whom would not otherwise be able to afford access and thus would have
    been left behind in this digital economy. It has provided connectivity for rural
    health clinics, helping ensure that telehealth can be delivered to people where
    they live instead of forcing them to drive hundreds of miles or go without care.
    And it has helped millions of low-income households get and stay connected to
    wired and mobile networks. Every single state and territory has greater connectivity
    as a result of the USF.

- en: These important missions remain vital because the work is not done. The Universal
    Service Fund must be reenvisioned to address today’s needs, including ensuring
    that there is a permanent funding mechanism for the ACP’s subsidy for low-income
    households. The Communications Act gives the FCC the power to modernize and expand
    how the USF is financed. As mentioned previously, only telephone companies, through
    their customers, currently pay fees into the USF. As more and more companies cease
    providing telephone services, they stop contributing, which increases the burden
    on a handful of companies and consumers. This is not sustainable.

  zh: 这些重要使命仍然至关重要，因为工作尚未完成。通信法赋予联邦通信委员会（FCC）更新和扩展美国通信基金的资金方式的权力，以应对当今的需求，包括确保ACP为低收入家庭提供补贴的永久资金机制。目前，通信法规定，只有电话公司通过其客户向美国通信基金缴费。随着越来越多公司停止提供电话服务，他们停止缴费，这增加了少数公司和消费者的负担。这种情况是不可持续的。
- en: To prevent the USF from collapsing and to save the broadband subsidy, the FCC
    should, without delay, start a proceeding to sustain and expand the USF through
    contributions by additional communications networks. It almost goes without saying
    that broadband companies should contribute to the fund, although others have urged
    that Congress should give the FCC the power to consider applying the fees to other
    companies that use communications networks, like cloud services or online companies
    like Google and Meta. Once the base of companies contributing to the USF is expanded,
    the FCC can replicate or even improve upon the subsidy that Congress provided
    in the ACP.
