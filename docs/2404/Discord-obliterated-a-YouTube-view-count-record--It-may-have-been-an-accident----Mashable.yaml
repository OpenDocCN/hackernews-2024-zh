    and his record of most subscribed individual creator on the platform. MrBeast
    also once [held the record](https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1693291545120624730
    "(opens in a new window)") for most viewed YouTube video in a 24-hour period after
    one of his uploads from August 2023 received nearly 60 million views in a day.

    Theft Auto VI trailer which dropped just this past December. The GTA 6 trailer
    garnered [more than 74 million views](https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-doesnt-like-grand-theft-auto)
    to grab that record from MrBeast.

    video announcing a new "Loot Boxes" feature. While the "feature" existed, Discord
    wasn't serious about it. It was an April Fools' Day joke. Discord Loot Boxes have
    already been removed from the platform.

    "(opens in a new window)") received *more than one billion views* in a 24 hour
    period.

    at around the 16-hour mark as YouTube struggled to keep up with the count before
    updating to 1.4 billion at around the 24-hour mark.

    in a vague reference to the video. Discord also posted a few snarky [replies](https://twitter.com/discord/status/1775232018105634849

    "(opens in a new window)") a very convincing breakdown of what likely happened.
    Basically, it appears Discord may have accidentally (or purposefully?) created
    a "working YouTube view bot" as Witt described it in a thread on X.

    announcement for users on the bottom right-hand corner of both the desktop app
    and web app.

    a screenshot](https://twitter.com/NurM4rvin/status/1774990406033264846 "(opens

    when logging into Discord on Monday morning.

    "(opens in a new window)") about Discord, the Loot Box video from Discord was
    embedded in this pop-up via an iframe.

    they hovered their mouse over the pop-up message, in which case the video would
    then pop-up from the message like [toast](https://twitter.com/NurM4rvin/status/1774999195675402320

    at the company from April 1st.

- en: Later in the day, some users started to notice that the pop-up's code in the
    Discord app had been changed to fix the issue, switching from the YouTube video
    to a video file. However, as Witt [noted](https://twitter.com/NurM4rvin/status/1775005410052690362
    "(opens in a new window)"), many of the views were coming from users who kept
    Discord open and weren't actively using the app, meaning the problem would remain
    until those users updated the app, or the pop-up message no longer appeared because
    April Fools' Day was over.

- en: The Discord Loot Box video will likely become the source of much debate within
    the YouTuber community too, since there will inevitably be controversy about whether
    the record should count. Even if it does, there's likely to be a huge asterisk
    on this record.

    they did that, but not in the exact way they had planned.
