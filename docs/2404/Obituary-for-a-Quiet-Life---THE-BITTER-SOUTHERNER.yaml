- en: What I’ll miss most is the sound of his voice, cooked up in the North Carolina
    mountains out of remnants from across an ocean. *There* always *thar*, *fire*
    always *far*. I loved the phrase *ever which a’way but loose*. Loved how things
    *liked to happen*. How *hello* was *what do you say* and how *being still* meant
    *setting awhile*.

- en: Even his voice was quiet, throaty and clipped in the way of men in these mountains
    — a voice meant for conversations beyond a crowd, meant for the group of men eyeing
    the door, aiming to be outside where it’d be easier to talk about nothing or just
    as soon not talk at all.

    his tongue. For nearly 70 years he kept up a constant, good-natured banter with
    Grandma over anything and everything.

- en: The morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the
    last time. He’d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom,
    he was awake again. He couldn’t find his voice — he’d been breathing through his
    mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up — so I leaned in. He looked to my
    sons and said, “Hey, fellers.”

    that’s how I meant it. He’d done so much good, even if it couldn’t be listed on
    official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The good of his
    life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I would long be
    swept up in it.
