- en: What I’ll miss most is the sound of his voice, cooked up in the North Carolina
    mountains out of remnants from across an ocean. *There* always *thar*, *fire*
    always *far*. I loved the phrase *ever which a’way but loose*. Loved how things
    *liked to happen*. How *hello* was *what do you say* and how *being still* meant
    *setting awhile*.

  zh: 我最怀念的是他的声音，从北卡罗来纳山区烹制而成，融合了海外的痕迹。*There* 总是 *thar*，*fire* 总是 *far*。我喜欢 *ever
    which a’way but loose* 这个说法。喜欢事情 *liked to happen*。喜欢 *hello* 意味着 *what do you
    say*，喜欢 *being still* 意味着 *setting awhile*。
- en: Even his voice was quiet, throaty and clipped in the way of men in these mountains
    — a voice meant for conversations beyond a crowd, meant for the group of men eyeing
    the door, aiming to be outside where it’d be easier to talk about nothing or just
    as soon not talk at all.

  zh: 他的声音即使轻柔也是沉稳的，在这些山区男人的特有方式中显得沙哑而短促 —— 一种为了超越人群的对话而生的声音，为了那些注视门口、想要出去更容易聊天或干脆不想说话的男人们。
- en: He could go hours without saying a word, but a flash of wit always waited on
    his tongue. For nearly 70 years he kept up a constant, good-natured banter with
    Grandma over anything and everything.

  zh: 他可以数小时不说一句话，但他的舌尖总是等待着机智的闪光。将近70年来，他与奶奶一直保持着持续而善意的玩笑对话，涵盖了无论什么事情。

  zh: 在他去世前一个月，他已经虚弱到坐在轮椅上，但每当奶奶走进厨房时，他的头依然会抬起：“嘿，漂亮姑娘。”
- en: The morning after Grandma called me, I took my boys by to see Papaw for the
    last time. He’d been unresponsive for a day, but when we entered the bedroom,
    he was awake again. He couldn’t find his voice — he’d been breathing through his
    mouth, and his throat was too dry to speak up — so I leaned in. He looked to my
    sons and said, “Hey, fellers.”

  zh: 在奶奶打电话告诉我的第二天早上，我带着孩子们去见爷爷最后一面。他已经无声无息了一天，但当我们进入卧室时，他又清醒了。他找不到声音 —— 他一直在用口呼吸，喉咙太干无法大声说话
    —— 所以我靠近了。他看向我的儿子们说：“嘿，小伙子们。”

- en: “You done good,” I said because that’s how he would’ve said it, but also because
    that’s how I meant it. He’d done so much good, even if it couldn’t be listed on
    official records or captured in the stat sheet of an obituary. The good of his
    life was ever-rippling water, quiet and steady, and my boys and I would long be
    swept up in it.

  zh: “你做得很好，”我说，因为那是他会说的话，也是我的真实想法。他做了很多好事，即使它们不能被列入正式记录或在讣告的统计表中捕捉到。他一生中的善行就像涟漪般绵延不绝，平静而持久，我和我的孩子们将长久被其感动。
