    and concluded that the BOAT’s cause was a supernova: an explosive and brilliant
    death of a star. The researchers also looked for heavy elements like gold and
    platinum but saw no signs of them, leaving the question of their origins just
    as open as before. The team’s research is [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02237-4)

    The heavy stuff in the universe is too abundant for such stellar mergers to account
    for all of them. Even after two stars in a binary system explode, leaving the
    dense shells that are neutron stars, “it can take billions and billions of years
    for the two neutron stars to slowly get closer and closer and finally merge,”
    according to Peter Blanchard, an astronomer at Northwestern University and the
    study’s lead author, in university [release](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2024/04/brightest-gamma-ray-burst-of-all-time-came-from-the-collapse-of-a-massive-star/?fj=1).

    enriched with heavy metals before most binary neutron stars would have had time
    to merge,” Blanchard added. “That’s pointing us to an alternative channel.”

    are associated with stars merging and black holes forming, [according to NASA](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/gamma-ray-bursts),
    while the longer bursts are associated with stellar deaths. The BOAT is staunchly
    in the latter camp.'

- en: The team intentionally waited for several months after the BOAT was detected
    to turn the Webb Telescope toward it. That’s because the explosion was so bright—and
    that brightness persisted for so long—that they needed to wait for the event to
    fade to spot any sign of the supernova that bore it.

    at the elements typically seen in supernovae. The signal wasn’t particularly bright,
    indicating that the supernova that yielded the brightest gamma ray burst ever
    seen wasn’t superlative itself.

    gamma-ray burst like the B.O.A.T. could make a lot of heavy elements like gold
    and platinum,” said study co-author Ashley Villar, an astrophysicist at Harvard
    University and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in the release.
    “If they were correct, the B.O.A.T. should have been a goldmine. It is really
    striking that we didn’t see any evidence for these heavy elements.”

    a staggering 10 hours, [according to ScienceNews](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova).
    But if we’re being technical, the [BOAT isn’t *actually* the BOAT](https://gizmodo.com/brightest-gamma-ray-burst-ever-the-boat-1850273973).
    But it is “likely the brightest burst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur
    since human civilization began,” according to Eric Burns, an astrophysicist at
    Louisiana State University a co-author of a [study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acba17)
    describing the signal.

    the BOAT put out gamma-rays with energies [reaching up to 13 teraelectronvolts](https://gizmodo.com/power-brightness-gamma-ray-burst-boat-1851025152)—the
    same energy as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider [during its second run](https://cmsexperiment.web.cern.ch/news/cms-embarks-data-collection-13-tev).

    June, a group reported on [the structure of the burst’s jet](https://gizmodo.com/unusual-jet-stream-found-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-1850515715),
    which may cause physicists to rework their models of jet structure. Despite all
    its accolades, the BOAT is not the largest explosion ever seen in space; that
    title belongs to AT2021lwx, a nearly 8-billion-year-old outburst from a distant
    black hole and the gas cloud surrounding it.

    observatories come online. One of the facilities with the most hype around it
    is the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile’s Atacama Desert, which will use a [3.2-billion-pixel
    camera](https://gizmodo.com/lsst-digital-camera-vera-rubin-observatory-slac-1851383305)
    to collect terabytes of data on the southern sky every night.
