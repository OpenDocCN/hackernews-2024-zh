- en: I know I'm not alone in this. Career questions, goals, and uncertainties occupy
    the minds of most people who haven't "figured it out" yet, or gotten where they
    think they want to go. This used to bother me a lot, not having a clear goal or
    plan for what I want to do for the next twenty or so years. But over time, it's
    bothered me less and less, as I've changed how I think about career success.

  zh: 我知道在这个问题上我并不孤单。对于大多数还没有“找到自己的路”或者没有达到他们认为的目标的人来说，职业问题、目标和不确定性占据了他们的头脑。过去，我对自己在未来二十年内想要做什么没有明确的目标或计划感到非常困扰。但随着时间的推移，这种困扰越来越少，因为我改变了对职业成功的看法。
- en: In college, I used to think that a successful career meant something that I
    loved doing and could happily do for my entire life. I also thought I had to find
    it fast. I believed (and still do, to some degree) that retirement would never
    be for me. I'd find the thing I want to do and keep doing that until the day I
    die. Some people work to live, while others live to work. I like to think I fall
    into the latter bucket. I couldn't imagine spending 10-15 years lounging around
    by a pool or playing golf with all of my free time in retirement. There's nothing
    wrong with that, but I know it wouldn't suit me. I need to always be doing something,
    always feel useful.

  zh: 在大学里，我曾认为成功的职业意味着我喜欢并且能一辈子愉快地从事的事情。我还以为我必须尽快找到。我相信（某种程度上现在仍然相信），退休对我来说永远不是选项。我会找到我想做的事情，并一直做下去，直到我生命的最后一天。有些人为了生活而工作，而我更愿意认为自己属于后者。我无法想象在退休时，会有10-15年的时间无所事事，或者将所有的空闲时间用于打高尔夫球或在泳池旁边晒太阳。这没有什么错，但我知道这不适合我。我需要始终做些事情，始终感到有用。
- en: The problem is, I haven't found my forever-career yet. I've bounced around and
    changed career paths quite a lot for someone who hasn't been working all that
    long. In college, I thought I wanted to be a Registered Dietitian. Then, I thought
    about pursuing physicians assistant or medical school. After a two-year stint
    working in an emergency room, I realized the clinical life was not for me. Still,
    I loved science and human health. I pursued a master's degree in Nutrition and
    Metabolism, where the career track after graduating would have placed me in a
    laboratory or a PhD program. But due to a growing interest in business and tech,
    I dropped out and took an internship with a startup accelerator, which helped
    me break into the field. I spent three years working with startups, first in business
    development and then product management. Now, I'm back to looking for my next
    thing, still unsure of what that might be.

  zh: 问题是，我还没有找到我一生的事业。尽管我还没有工作很长时间，但我已经在不同的职业道路上反复跳跃和改变。大学时，我以为自己想成为一名注册营养师。然后，我考虑过成为医疗助理或者上医学院。在急诊室工作了两年后，我意识到临床生活并不适合我。尽管如此，我依然热爱科学和人类健康。我攻读了营养与代谢硕士学位，毕业后的职业轨迹本应将我放在实验室或博士项目中。但由于对商业和技术的兴趣日益增长，我退出了学校，并在一家创业加速器实习，这帮助我进入了这个领域。我在初创企业中工作了三年，先是从事业务发展，后来转向产品管理。现在，我又开始寻找下一个事业方向，仍然不确定会是什么。
- en: In the past, this would have kept me up at night. But out of a necessity for
    more peace of mind, I've changed how I think about career success. Instead of
    needing to hit the bullseye on my next try, landing the career I'll stay in for
    the rest of my life, I now realize that I only need to get closer to it.

  zh: 这种事情过去常常让我夜不能寐。但为了更多的内心宁静，我改变了对职业成功的看法。现在我意识到，与其在下一次尝试中命中靶心，找到一辈子都能从事的职业，我只需要更接近这个目标。
- en: This has taken a tremendous amount of pressure off of my career decision making,
    and has instead made the whole endeavor a lot more fun. I've started thinking
    of my career as a dartboard, with a bullseye in the center, representing the "perfect"
    career. Each "throw" of a dart is a new experiment in figuring out what I want
    to spend the majority of my time doing. I get as many throws as I want--it's really
    up to me. The number of throw's I get is all dependent on how many experiments
    I'm willing to run, how many new experiences I'm open to trying.

  zh: 这让我在职业决策上减少了很大的压力，取而代之的是让整个尝试更加有趣。我开始把我的职业看作是一个靶子，靶心代表着“完美”的职业。每一次“投掷”都是我在试图找到我想要花费大部分时间做的事情的新实验。我可以投掷尽可能多的飞镖
    - 这完全取决于我自己。我可以得到多少次“投掷”的机会完全取决于我愿意尝试多少实验，愿意尝试多少新的经历。
- en: What's important to realize is that a throw doesn't have to mean quitting your
    job or taking a new one. Simply starting a new hobby, taking a class, or moving
    to a new part of the world can lead to more accurate throws.

    open-mic comedy set](https://tll.beehiiv.com/p/3-things-learned-first-time-standup-comedy).
    I had no allusions of pursuing stand up comedy as a career, it was just something

- en: '**One**, I''m a lot better at public speaking than I thought. I got on stage,
    in front of a room full of strangers, and told jokes that until that point only
    the walls of my apartment had heard. And it went well. I got laughs, I didn''t
    freeze up, and I felt invigorated and excited being up on stage. **Two**, I learned
    how important creativity is to my well-being. I had never considered myself to
    be a creative person. I was never good at drawing or music, and have always had
    pretty vanilla tastes when it came to art. But joke writing was a whole new kind
    of creativity that I had never expressed until this experience. I found the whole
    process of thinking, writing, and telling jokes to be an incredible creative outlet
    for me, and one I enjoyed very much. I now consider myself a creative person,
    and know that I need some form of creativity in my life. **Three**, I''m way better
    at making observations and connections than I thought. Joke writing is all about
    observing yourself and the world. Jokes are funny when they make connections to
    things that the audience wasn''t expecting. Cycling through all the possible connections,
    and looking for the funniest ones, is one of the most exciting and gratifying
    parts of writing a good joke.'

  zh: '-   **第一**，我发现自己在公开演讲方面比我想象的要好得多。我站在舞台上，面对一群陌生人，讲了些在那之前只有我公寓的墙壁听过的笑话。而且表现得不错。我引起了笑声，没有结结巴巴，我感到很振奋和兴奋站在舞台上。
    -   **第二**，我意识到创造力对我的健康非常重要。我从未认为自己是一个有创造力的人。我画画和音乐都不擅长，当谈到艺术时我一直持有相当普通的看法。但写笑话是一种我以前从未表达过的全新创造力。我发现思考、写作和讲笑话的整个过程对我来说是一种令人难以置信的创造性出口，而且我非常喜欢。我现在认为自己是一个有创造力的人，并且知道我生活中需要一些创造力的形式。
    -   **第三**，我在观察和连接方面比我想象的要好得多。写笑话完全是关于观察自己和世界。当笑话让观众感到意外时，它们才会有趣。循环遍历所有可能的联系，并寻找最有趣的联系，是写好笑话最令人兴奋和满足的部分之一。'
- en: These three things--public speaking, creativity, and careful observation--are
    all components of what I now know I want out of a career. If I can do something

- en: Another advantage of taking this approach to figuring out your career is that
    it becomes difficult to explain what you do. That might not sound like an advantage,
    but it is. The more nuanced and unique you become as a professional in your given
    field, the harder you become to replace. If I end up becoming the guy who gives
    lighthearted, witty public presentations on how technology is transforming our
    relationship to nutrition and medicine, good luck finding someone else to do that
    job.

  zh: 采取这种方法来找到自己的职业的另一个好处是，这让解释你所做的工作变得困难。这听起来可能不像是优势，但其实是。在你所处的领域中，你变得越来越细腻和独特，你就越难以被替代。如果最终我成为那个轻松幽默，机智地公开演讲技术如何改变我们对营养和医学关系看法的人，那找到另一个人来做这份工作就难了。
- en: By maximizing the number of throws I get in my attempt to hit my career bullseye,
    I'll not only get closer, faster, but I'll carve out a niche for myself that is

    become an irreplaceable piece of a larger whole. Those are options worth spending
