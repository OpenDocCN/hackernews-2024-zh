    to understand:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1. *Initiative:* The world of Mercer uses turn based battle mechanics. This
    means each creature takes it in turn to move and attack. The order of this is
    defined by an initiative dice roll, where the highest roll gets to go first. This
    order is set in the first round of combat and stays consistent throughout the
    battle
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. *Range and Movement:* Battles take place on a wide battle arena, where distance
    is important.   Each ceature has their own movement they can achieve each turn,
    as well as different ranges of attack. You can only attack a creature if you are
    within range.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Melee creatures for example can only attack when they are next to another creature,
    but ranged attacks can benefit from being at a distance Make sure to track the
    distance between your party and your enemy!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. *Hitting an Enemy :* Once you are in range of attacking the enemy, we now
    need to see if your attack hits or not.     This hit roll is all based on armour
    class and randomly probability. If your roll falls below the enemy armour class,
    the attack will miss.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. *Damage Calculation:* Each weapon and attack move has the capability of
    hitting a range of damage. This damage scales with your level Details on what
    dice and bonuses are added to your attack role are shown on the Character Stats
    screen (accessible via the map)  .
