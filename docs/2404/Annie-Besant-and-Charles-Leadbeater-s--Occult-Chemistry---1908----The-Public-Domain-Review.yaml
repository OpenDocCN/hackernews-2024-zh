- en: 'Besant and Leadbeater’s investigations in *Occult Chemistry* begin with “four
    gases in the air” — hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and “a fourth gas (atomic weight=3)
    so far not discovered by chemists.” These were the simplest elements. As the atomic
    number increased, so did their geometric complexity of the atoms. Sodium, for
    example, was “composed of an upper part, divisible into a globe and 12 funnels,
    a lower part, similarly divided; and a connecting rod.” The atoms were duly grouped,
    not as in the periodic table (which is organized according to atomic number and
    reveals different elements’ related chemical properties), but according to overall
    shapes: spikes, dumbbell, tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, crossed bases, and star.
    Thus, boron, nitrogen, and vanadium, for example — elements with little in common
    chemically — all “have six funnels opening on the six faces of a cube”.'
