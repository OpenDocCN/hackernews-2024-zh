    different sounds and musical styling. Research has shown that adolescents exhibit
    higher levels of open-earedness, with a greater willingness to explore and appreciate
    diverse musical genres. During these years of sonic exploration, music gets wrapped
    up in the emotion and identity formation of youth; as a result, the songs of our
    childhood prove wildly influential over our lifelong music tastes.

    was twelve when Green Day released their landmark "American Idiot" album, a work
    that proved monumental in my relationship to music. Listening to the album's titular
    track felt like a supreme act of rebellion (for a twelve-year-old suburbanite).
