- en: Two weeks ago, Apple modified their App Store guidelines to allow retro game
    emulators in the App Store. This week, Delta, a multi-system emulator that was
    previously only available via AltStore, [was released on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688).

    (our fork of Dolphin) to the App Store.

- en: The GameCube and Wii have a PowerPC-based CPU inside them. All modern Apple
    devices use an ARM-based CPU. It isn’t possible to directly run PowerPC code on
    an ARM CPU, and vice versa. Therefore, if we want to run a GameCube or Wii game
    on an iPhone, it is necessary to translate the game’s PowerPC code to ARM so that
    the CPU can understand it.

- en: Dolphin uses something called a Just-in-Time (JIT) recompiler to achieve this.
    Whenever the emulated console wants to run game code, Dolphin will use its JIT
    to translate the PowerPC code to ARM, and then execute the results.

    iOS. The only exceptions are Safari and alternative web browsers in Europe.

    denied the request a few weeks ago.

- en: It’s hard to tell exactly why Apple is so hesitant to open up JIT support. It’s
    possible that they consider it to be a security risk. (Looking at the various
    restrictions and limitations placed on JavaScript JITs for alternative web browsers
    in Europe, they do appear to be worried about its potential to be abused.)

- en: It is technically possible to run Dolphin without its JIT recompiler. When doing
    so, Dolphin uses something called an “interpreter” to run the PowerPC code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the interpreter is many times slower than the JIT recompiler.

    performance difference for yourself. One uses the interpreter, and the other uses
    JIT.

    we would likely get endless complaints from users about the poor performance.
    App Review might also just reject us anyway because the app is unusable.
