- en: In 1688 a young Swiss milkmaid clambered over a rocky outcrop. She was halfway
    up an Alpine slope when she slipped and tumbled down several feet. Seriously injured,
    she was carried away to hospital in the nearby town where she lay, unconscious,
    for days. Physicians plied her with remedies and performed surgeries, and gradually
    she healed. Once physically better, however, she awoke and sat straight up in
    her hospital  bed. Realising that she was no longer in the mountain village of
    her birth, homesickness took hold. She spat out her foods and medicines and wailed,
    ‘Ich will Heim; ich will Heim’ (‘I want to go home; I want to go home’). She would
    say nothing else, turning listlessly to the wall. Eventually her parents came
    to collect her. Almost immediately her mood and condition improved and, after
    just a few days back in her own home, she returned to full fitness, entirely without
    the aid of further medical care.

  zh: 1688年，一位年轻的瑞士牛奶女仆攀登岩石陡坡时滑倒，从几英尺高处摔下。她严重受伤，被送往附近城镇的医院，昏迷了几天。医生们用各种药物治疗并进行手术，慢慢地她康复了。但一旦身体稍好，她醒来后便坐起来，意识到自己已不在出生的山村，怀乡病发作。她吐掉食物和药物，哭喊道：“Ich
    will Heim; ich will Heim”（“我要回家；我要回家”）。她再也不说其他话，无精打采地转向墙壁。最终她的父母来接她。几乎立刻，她的情绪和健康状况都有所改善，回到自己的家后仅仅几天，完全没有再接受医疗照护便完全康复了。
