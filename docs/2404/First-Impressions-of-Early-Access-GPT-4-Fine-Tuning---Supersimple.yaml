    early access), and were super excited to check out how well it works. We’d been
    a user of OpenAI’s fine-tuned models since fine-tuning the original GPT-3 davinci
    model first became available.

    takes the user's question, relevant parts of their [semantic data model](https://www.supersimple.io/blog/semantic-layers),
    existing reports and dashboards, and generates an exploration that answers the
    question with the most context possible.

    that we designed for our specific use case, that’s token-efficient and well-aligned
    with pre-trained language models. This DSL gets compiled into JSON, that we in
    turn compile into one or more database queries to be executed. Finally, we render
    an interactive data exploration to the user based on the report structure dictated
    by the DSL.
