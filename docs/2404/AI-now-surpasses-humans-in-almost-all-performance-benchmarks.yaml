    of AI and its growing significance in our everyday lives. It examines everything
    from which sectors use AI the most to which country is most nervous about losing
    jobs to AI. But one of the most salient takeaways from the report is AI’s performance
    when pitted against humans.

    frankly shocking number of significant benchmarks. In 2015, it surpassed us in
    image classification, then basic reading comprehension (2017), visual reasoning
    (2020), and natural language inference (2021).

    are now obsolete. Indeed, researchers in this area are scrambling to develop new,
    more challenging benchmarks. To put it simply, AIs are getting so good at passing
    tests that now we need new tests – not to measure competence, but to highlight
    areas where humans and AIs are still different, and find where we still have an
    advantage.

    knowledge in a visual context to make predictions. For example, when shown an
    image of a cat on a table, an AI with VCR should predict that the cat might jump
    off the table or that the table is sturdy enough to hold it, given its weight.
