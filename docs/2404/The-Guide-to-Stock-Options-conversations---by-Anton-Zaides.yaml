    shares. These shares represent ownership in the company. For example, if a company

    them the right to buy shares at a specific price, known as the exercise price
    (or grant price/strike price), after a certain period has passed. This is a way
    for companies to reward employees and encourage them to stay longer and work towards
    making the company more successful.
  prefs: []

    employees to buy shares at the lower exercise price and potentially sell them
    at a higher market price, making a profit.

    vesting quite a bit of equity. When it was time to leave, I had some very serious
    conversations with my family. We made the bet and put down a lot of money to exercise,
    then spent 3.5 years waiting. Finally, the news came that the company was going
    public, and I got an even bigger check than I had from Yammer. I started reconnecting
    with coworkers and it was… heartbreaking.
