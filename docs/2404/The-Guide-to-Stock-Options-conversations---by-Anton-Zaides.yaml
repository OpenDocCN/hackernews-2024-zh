    shares. These shares represent ownership in the company. For example, if a company

    them the right to buy shares at a specific price, known as the exercise price
    (or grant price/strike price), after a certain period has passed. This is a way
    for companies to reward employees and encourage them to stay longer and work towards
    making the company more successful.

    employees to buy shares at the lower exercise price and potentially sell them
    at a higher market price, making a profit.

    vesting quite a bit of equity. When it was time to leave, I had some very serious
    conversations with my family. We made the bet and put down a lot of money to exercise,
    then spent 3.5 years waiting. Finally, the news came that the company was going
    public, and I got an even bigger check than I had from Yammer. I started reconnecting
    with coworkers and it was… heartbreaking.
