- en: The veteran probe began sending unreadable data back to Earth in [late 2023](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/engineers_work_to_fix_voyager/),
    and engineers have tried to understand the nature of the issue. Last month, they
    [sent a command](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/14/voyager_1_not_dead/) –
    a "poke" to the spacecraft's Flight Data System (FDS) – and the resulting data
    stream contained a complete memory dump from the computer.

- en: The team was able to use this readout, which contained the computer's code and
    variables, to ascertain that approximately 3 percent of the FDS memory had been
    corrupted. That corruption is preventing normal operation of the FDS, which is
    responsible for packaging the probe's engineering and science data before it gets
    passed to the Telemetry Modulation Unit (TMU), the radio transmitter and is sent
    back to Earth.

    that a single chip responsible for the corrupted portion of memory is at fault,
    although they can only make an informed guess with regard to what has happened.

    in space, or that an energetic particle might have damaged it.

    they can find a way for the FDS to operate normally without the unusable memory
    hardware, which would enable Voyager 1 to begin returning science and engineering
    data again."'

    traced to the FDS. A computer reset dealt with the problem.
