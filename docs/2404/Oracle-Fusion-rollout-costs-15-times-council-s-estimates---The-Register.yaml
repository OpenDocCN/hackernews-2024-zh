    of swapping its ERP system from SAP to Oracle to go from £2.6 million ($3.26 million)
    to nearly £40 million ($50 million), as the council seeks a new implementation
    partner for a project that began nearly five years ago.

    Ellison may come to regret [boasting about](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/26/ellisons_exemplar_oracle_win_over/).
    Responsible for spending £2 billion ($2.5 billion) on local services, the council
    said it was reviewing the migration from an aging SAP ERP system to a cloud-based
    instance of Oracle Fusion, a migration which began in 2019, after parting ways
    with systems integrator DXC.

    kick off next month. The final element of the new system is expected to go live
    in April 2026, just months before support for the current SAP system is set to
    end.
