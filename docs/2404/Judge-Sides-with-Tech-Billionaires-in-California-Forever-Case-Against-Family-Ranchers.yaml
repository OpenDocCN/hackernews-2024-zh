    the tech billionaire-backed effort to create a new city on thousands of acres
    of Bay Area farmland, has faced a number of challenges, including a legal dispute
    between the project’s backers and a number of families who are longtime residents
    of the area where developers want to build.'

    of those families](https://gizmodo.com/california-forever-flannery-associates-marc-andreessen-1850981424),
    accusing them of engaging in a “price fixing” conspiracy and demanding half a
    billion dollars in damages. The farmers accused California Forever of deploying
    “strong-arm tactics” to pry loose their land.

    Judge Troy Nunley, of Sacramento, denied an effort by the landowners to get California
    Forever’s litigation thrown out of court, The Mercury News [reported](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/04/01/silicon-valley-billionaires-planning-solano-county-california-forever-utopia-score-big-win-in-510-million-fight-against-farmers/)
    Monday. Nunley claimed that messages exchanged between property owners two years
    ago provided “direct evidence” of a price-fixing effort.

    owner to another saying that they shouldn’t allow California Forever developers
    to engage in “bullying the last of the property owners.” The same land owner asserted
    that the “remaining property owners should be in agreement on what we would want
    to sell our properties” so that California would be unable to “play owners against
    owners.”

    stated that the “hyper-aggressive behavior [by California Forever] seems to indicate
    that we are in a very good position and it is best not to engage with them at
    this point.” That same owner also said: “No one is suggesting that we don’t sell,
    the question is when and at what price. Several of the other major land owners
    in the area are basically taking their time as well and not engaging.”'

- en: Nunely’s refusal to throw out the case doesn’t necessarily mean that California
    Forever will win its legal case. The allegations that California Forever tried
    to bully longtime residents out of their land led to a series of [contentious
    town hall meetings](https://gizmodo.com/california-forever-solano-county-billionaires-silicon-v-1851078305)
    in which locals openly yelled at Jan Sramek, the project’s CEO. Residents accused
    the project developers of being untrustworthy and of trying to profit off the
    local community.

- en: If the recent court ruling is good news for the project’s developers legal case,
    it’s unclear if it will actually help them accomplish their longterm goal of creating
    a new city out of nothing but hundreds of acres of Bay Area farmland. The CF project
    is currently attempting to persuade Solano County residents [to support the creation
    of a ballot initiative](https://gizmodo.com/tech-billionaires-project-to-build-a-new-city-accused-o-1851355578)
    that would allow locals to vote on in November. The project was accused of tricking
    locals into signing petitions in support of the initiative, but developers have
    denied the allegations.
