- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Barry," who shared a story from
    the early 1990s, when he was a student of IT. One summer, Barry scored a gig as
    a tech intern at an architecture firm.

  zh: 本周，让我们认识一个名为“Barry”的读者，他分享了一个关于上世纪90年代初他作为IT学生的故事。有一个夏天，Barry在一家建筑公司担任技术实习生。
- en: '"It was still the time of such things as 5 1/4" floppy disks, and mice were
    still a novelty," he told On Call.'

  zh: “那时还是5 1/4英寸软盘的时代，而且鼠标仍然是一种新奇事物，”他告诉On Call。
- en: Such a novelty that Barry soon found himself answering a call from an architect
    who complained his mouse couldn't reach the top half of his screen. The mouse
    pointer would make it halfway up the screen, then stop.
  id: totrans-split-9

  zh: 这样一个新奇的事情，Barry很快发现自己接到了一个架构师的电话，抱怨他的鼠标无法到达屏幕的上半部分。鼠标指针会达到屏幕的一半，然后停止。
- en: As Barry strode off to visit the user, he imagined that perhaps the mouse ball
    had become dirty – a common problem back in the day when mice detected motion
    using rollers that grazed a sphere lodged within the innards of the digital rodent.
    As users moved their mouse, the ball dragged along their desks and started spinning,
    moving the rollers and eventually causing the pointer to move.

  zh: 当Barry走向用户时，他想象也许是鼠标球变脏了——这在老式鼠标使用滚轮检测运动时是一个常见问题，滚轮擦过内部的球体。当用户移动鼠标时，球在他们的桌面上拖动并开始旋转，推动滚轮，最终导致指针移动。
- en: These mouse balls would sometimes pick up lint and gum up the rollers inside
    the mouse, so Barry's hypothesis was apt for the era.

  zh: 这些鼠标球有时会粘上绒毛并卡住鼠标内部的滚轮，因此Barry的假设适合那个时代。
- en: It was also wrong in this instance. The ball was fine. Instead, the problem
    was that the architect was unaware that it was possible to pick up a mouse and
    relocate it without the pointer moving from its current position.
  id: totrans-split-12

  zh: 在这种情况下也是错误的。鼠标球没问题。问题在于架构师并不知道可以把鼠标拿起来重新放置而不会导致指针从当前位置移动。
- en: Instead, the architect moved the mouse as far as it could go, which wasn't very
    far, as mice of the time were connected to PCs by cords.

  zh: 而架构师将鼠标移动到它能到达的最远处，但这并不远，因为当时的鼠标通过线缆连接到个人电脑。
- en: '"He had moved the mouse further and further on his desk to the point at which
    it was ascending the wall behind it, and he had reached a point where he simply
    could not reach any higher," Barry told On Call.'

  zh: “他把鼠标在他的桌子上越来越远地移动到一个点，到达一个他根本无法再把手伸得更高的地步，”Barry告诉On Call。

    the radical solution to his problem," Barry told On Call.'

  zh: 架构师出奇地接受了这个消息。
- en: '"Thankfully he did not get defensive, but simply accepted the news silently
    and continued about his day," Barry told On Call.'

  zh: “幸运的是，他没有变得防御，而是默默接受了这个消息，并继续了他的一天，”Barry告诉On Call。
- en: 'The experience remains fresh in his mind to this day because it taught an important
    lesson: "You can never assume anything about users," Barry wrote.'

  zh: 这次经历至今在他脑海中仍然清晰，因为它教会了一个重要的教训：“你绝不能对用户有任何假设，”Barry写道。
