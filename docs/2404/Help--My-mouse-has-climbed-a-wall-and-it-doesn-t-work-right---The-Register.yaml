    Register* to once again deliver a fresh instalment of On Call – our weekly reader-contributed
    tale of tech support torments and triumphs.

- en: This week, meet a reader we'll Regomize as "Barry," who shared a story from
    the early 1990s, when he was a student of IT. One summer, Barry scored a gig as
    a tech intern at an architecture firm.

    still a novelty," he told On Call.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such a novelty that Barry soon found himself answering a call from an architect
    who complained his mouse couldn't reach the top half of his screen. The mouse
    pointer would make it halfway up the screen, then stop.

- en: As Barry strode off to visit the user, he imagined that perhaps the mouse ball
    had become dirty – a common problem back in the day when mice detected motion
    using rollers that grazed a sphere lodged within the innards of the digital rodent.
    As users moved their mouse, the ball dragged along their desks and started spinning,
    moving the rollers and eventually causing the pointer to move.

- en: These mouse balls would sometimes pick up lint and gum up the rollers inside
    the mouse, so Barry's hypothesis was apt for the era.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was also wrong in this instance. The ball was fine. Instead, the problem
    was that the architect was unaware that it was possible to pick up a mouse and
    relocate it without the pointer moving from its current position.

- en: Instead, the architect moved the mouse as far as it could go, which wasn't very
    far, as mice of the time were connected to PCs by cords.

    it was ascending the wall behind it, and he had reached a point where he simply
    could not reach any higher," Barry told On Call.'

    the radical solution to his problem," Barry told On Call.'

    and continued about his day," Barry told On Call.'

    lesson: "You can never assume anything about users," Barry wrote.'
