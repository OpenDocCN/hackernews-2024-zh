    do, they passed them with flying colours. But even as they passed them with flying
    colours, they still can’t answer questions that [seem simple](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/04/gpt-4-turbo-still-doesnt-answer-this-question-well.html),

    where inference gets less reliable. (This is also why forms of prompt injections
    work, because it distorts the attention mechanism.) This ‘goal drift’ means that
    agents, or tasks done in a sequence with iteration, get less reliable. It ‘forgets’
    where to focus, because its attention is not selective nor dynamic.

    a tape for memory, transformers use their internal states (managed through self-attention)

    essentially finding ways to make the inference on track. So, given enough cleverness
    in prompting and step-by-step iteration LLMs ***can*** be made to elicit almost

    of iterative computation that no model seems to be able to do. In some ways this
    makes sense, because an auto regressive model can only do one forward pass at
    a time, which means it can at best use it existing token repository and output
    as a scratch pad to keep thinking out loud, but it loses track so so fast.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    attention is done currently is static and processes all parts of the sequence

    trying to predict all the outputs in one run, running on intuition, without being
    able to backtrack or check broader logic. It also means it’s not learning the
    5 or 8 rules that actually underpin the output.

    first came about, the days of early AI, they had limited processing power and
    almost no real useful search or evaluation functions. So you had to rely on kludges,
