    is a behind the scenes info about how we dynamically limit concurrent connections
    per user. It’s particularly important for us since browsers are notoriously [messy
    to host](https://www.browserless.io/blog/advanced-issues-when-managing-chrome-on-aws),
    and our thousands of users can change to plans with different concurrency limits
    at any time.

    connection limits on-the-fly to accommodate different customer plans and usage
    patterns.

- en: Our service provides a pool of hosted Chrome, Firefox and WebKit browsers. We
    have thousands of users, each with limits of at least 25 browsers depending on
    their plan. These are primarily spread between our two main server locations of
    London and San Francisco.
  prefs: []

    That means they start up, running a script for some amount of seconds or minutes,
    then close.

    large batch of web scraping, then do nothing for a week. Meanwhile, we have users
    fairly regularly starting browsers 24/7 for tasks such as generating PDF exports
    of dashboards.

    the default.conf file. The module is invoked within the `access_by_lua_block`
    and `log_by_lua_block` directives, leveraging the Authorization header as the
    identifier for each customer token.

- en: When using the limiter, we encountered escalating CPU and memory consumption
    over time, indicating the presence of a memory leak. This posed a significant
    challenge as it necessitated periodic service restarts to prevent crashes, prompting
    an exhaustive investigation to identify and resolve the underlying issue.

    removed the database connection, but unfortunately, it didn't resolve the issue.
    Next, I removed the local cache, yet the problem persisted.

    "limiter"` and consolidating all code into a single file. Surprisingly, this resolved
    the issue.

    using the [package.path](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.path)
    within the Lua script to import my custom Lua folder.

    increased because I was concatenating my folder name to the same value in every

    revealed an accumulation of folder names.'

    correct approach, as suggested by the Lua official documentation. However, this
    method caused the mentioned problems in our specific use case. Eventually, I referred
    to the [lua-nginx-module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path)
    documentation to find the correct way to import modules, and the problem was resolved
    by adding the `lua_package_path` directive to the nginx.conf file.

    a local cache with a Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism to store customer limits. This
    optimization strategy effectively reduced latency and alleviated the strain on
