# CVE-2024-3094 XZ Backdoor Investigation Request to GitLab Team (#452603) · Issues · GitLab.org / GitLab · GitLab

As some of you might already know, an attacker used social engineering to gain the maintainer role to the XZ `liblzma` compression library. A hunt is underway to find any other contributions that attacker made to open projects. A number of FOSS projects are not hosted on GitHub, but here on GitLab and are not mirrored over to GitHub. This attacker was a busy bee analyzing a number of other libraries beyond XZ.

Some major distributions including Debian, Fedora, openSUSE had pipelined the poisoned versions of `liblzma` and a few others such as Kali Linux got as far as hanging it out to distribution to their general audience.

We need GitLab to hunt down this key for any user profiles that may have been using it between December 2023 and March 26 2024.

This is the attacker's keys that was used on GitHub: [https://github.com/jiat75.keys](https://github.com/jiat75.keys)

Yes, it may feel fruitless to hunt because the attacker might have been smart to not use the same key/profile, but it is worth the effort just in case the attacker did not do that.
