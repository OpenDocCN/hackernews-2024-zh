- en: Aruba’s colonial history also meant documents were spread all over the place.
    “Our collection was scattered,” says Edric Croes, the head of archival conservation
    and management at the National Archives of Aruba. There were works to be scanned
    across the world, including in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and
    other islands like Curaçao. Establishing a hub to find the documents online has
    been especially helpful, Scholing notes, for researchers located abroad, who no
    longer have to travel to Aruba to physically dig through archives.

    “In a dream world, every national library would have enough funds to bring on
    an amazing team of people,” says University of Waterloo history professor Ian
    Milligan, who is writing a book on the Internet Archive’s origins, and was not
    involved in the Aruba project. “Governments often don't have that.”

    collection, although it has worked with a number of national and regional libraries
    around the world. Back in 2011, it partnered with the Culture Office of Bali,
    an island province of Indonesia, to [preserve](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/brewster-kahle/)
    what the office described at the time as “90 percent of Bali’s literature.” (This
    now makes up the Internet Archive’s [Balinese Digital Library](https://archive.org/details/Bali)
    collection.)

    “It’s a really feasible model that could be applied to a lot of small islands,
    developing states, even bigger countries with limited means,” Scholing says.

- en: Partnering with the Internet Archive looks like an obvious solution for cash-strapped
    archivists. Potential partners do need to think, though, about what it means to
    rely on another country’s private organization, one with its own challenges.

- en: “When we think about digital preservation, we often think of the technical challenges,”
    says Milligan of Waterloo. “But I think the biggest challenges are the social
    challenges, the human challenges. How can you set up an organization that will
    be here in 50 years?”

    of future-proofing. But that doesn’t make it wholly invulnerable. The Archive
    is currently facing a number of serious legal challenges, including [a lawsuit](https://www.reuters.com/legal/music-labels-sue-internet-archive-over-digitized-record-collection-2023-08-12/)
    from major record labels, including Universal Music Group, Capitol, and Sony,
    that poses an existential threat—the labels are asking for damages that could
    amount to over $400 million.

    over a digital lending library it established during the pandemic. While its digitization
    capabilities are far more robust than many nation-states, the Internet Archive’s
    position in an increasingly vituperative battleground between copyright holders
    and tech companies means that its future is precarious, too.

    really empowering to see that the nation of Aruba is continuing to add materials
    and upload content at the same time that we're facing this,” Freeland says. “We’re
    in this for the long haul.”
