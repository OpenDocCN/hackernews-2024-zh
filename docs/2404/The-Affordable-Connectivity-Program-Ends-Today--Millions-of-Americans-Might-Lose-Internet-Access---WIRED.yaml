- en: In 2021, the US Congress passed the $1.2 trillion [Infrastructure Investment
    and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684), also
    known as [the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/).
    It was a massive, ambitious piece of legislation that aimed to shore up a [variety
    of floundering industries](https://www.wired.com/story/5-things-may-not-know-infrastructure-bill/),
    including transit networks, energy systems, and public utilities. The ACP was
    part of that deal. It set aside $14.2 billion to fund credits that could help
    low-income households afford high-speed internet. If a family’s household income
    was below 200 percent of the [Federal Poverty Guideline](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Affordable-Connectivity-Program.jpg)
    per year, they were eligible for a $30 monthly credit on their broadband bill.
    People living on Tribal lands were eligible to receive up to $75.

    is a necessity in modern society, especially in the post-Covid era, when remote
    work has been normalized. Not being able to get online can contribute to a widening
    [digital divide](https://www.wired.com/story/schools-digital-divide-remote-learning/),
    where people without internet access can fall behind socially and economically.
    Americans who have come to depend on the discount will see their internet bills
    spike and will potentially be forced to balance the increased cost with paying
    for food, rent, and other essential needs. Not to mention that many ACP beneficiaries
    had come to rely on getting their internet for free; initial [urging by the White
    House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/getinternet/) led to many internet providers
    offering plans with minimum download speeds of 100 Mbps for $30 a month. Customers
    who were applying their ACP benefit to these plans were getting internet access
    for free. Starting tomorrow, they will have to start paying for it.

    Mbps的计划。将ACP福利应用于这些计划的客户免费获取互联网接入。从明天开始，他们将不得不开始支付费用。

    long a program can go on without being renewed by Congress. The Biden administration
    has made several pleas to lawmakers to save the program, including one last October
    requesting a [$6 billion investment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/25/fact-sheet-white-house-calls-on-congress-to-support-critical-domestic-needs/)
    to continue the program, among other domestic spending. Despite that and a number
    of pleas from [advocacy groups](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/blog/2023/10/25/white-house-asks-congress-for-6-billion-to-keep-acp-going/)

- en: Unfortunately, any of the families who have been getting the ACP benefit will
    have to start paying full price for their internet connections—provided they’re
    able to afford it. If a household’s income is below 200 percent of the [federal
    poverty line](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines),
    or if the household claims other government benefits like SNAP, Medicaid, or Social
    Security, there’s a way to get a similar reduction in internet cost, albeit a
    much smaller one. The Universal Service Administrative Company offers a service
    called [Lifeline](https://www.lifelinesupport.org/), which can pay up to $9.25
    per month for a connection (and up to $34.25 per month for anyone living on qualifying
