- en: Shortly after Ron Gittins died in September 2019 at age 79, his family visited
    the apartment where he had lived since the mid-1980s in Birkenhead, just outside
    of Liverpool in northwest England.

    every available surface in his home and painted numerous murals depicting historical
    scenes. Among the artworks were paintings set in Ancient Egypt and Georgian England,
    as well as fireplaces in the shape of a roaring lion’s head and a giant minotaur
    head, and there was even a Roman bread oven.

    artistic training, largely discouraged people from visiting his home, an apartment
    on the first floor of a Victorian duplex comprising three main rooms, a hallway,

    by Tate as “art that has a naïve quality, often produced by people who have not

    way, usually with no formal training and outside the influence of the mainstream
    art world.”'
