- en: I'm following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is
    currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU's DMA makes me sad. Not
    for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor
    for the people who run that company. I'm sad because the pursuit of endless growth
    is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you're an artisan,
    creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to
    last forever. And if they don't, you want to do such an amazing job that once
    something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to
    make something new, rather than buying from someone else.

    It still works fine. Sure, it's slow compared to my new machine but I can use
    it to do calls and write blog posts. And that's great. I love it. I was happy
    to give Apple my money back in 2015\. But you know who's not happy? Apple. Apple
    is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still
    working fine 9 years later. And it's also not happy that I bought a phone more
    than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they
    need to make money. More money. There's no end state here. *"More"* has no end
    state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing
    to buy their stuff. Because it's unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones,
    laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so
    what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage.
    You name it. But those also can't grow forever. Because guess what? There are
    other companies out there doing the same.

    it means they're failing. Forget that they make amazing products that can last
    decades with no issues. Forget that they're an almost 3-fucking-trillions dollar
    company. If they're not growing enough, stock goes down and that's no good. Because
    remember, there's no finish line here. They can't just be happy with their size.
    They can't be happy with the idea of employing thousands of smart people and creating
    amazing products. No, they have to keep growing. And sooner or later, this mind
    cancer becomes malignant.

    big company. It's an issue with everyone who can't accept that they reached their
    end state.

- en: Cory Doctorow famously coined the enshittification term to describe the sad
    trend of online services going to shit over time. I don't think that's just an
    online services issue. It's a societal issue related to the pursuit of endless
    growth. And if you think about it, it's a deeply human issue. It's what happens
    when you can't say stop. No matter what you're doing, it can be something positive
    or negative, if you can't say stop, bad things will happen. Try to go for a run,
    and don't stop. Ever. Or try to drink water, and don't stop. Ever.

    trillion-dollar company but we don't celebrate when someone says *"You know what?
    I think I have enough"*.
