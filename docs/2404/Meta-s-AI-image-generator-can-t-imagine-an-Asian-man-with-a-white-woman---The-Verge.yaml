    couple or two friends of different races? Seems pretty common to me — I have lots
    of white friends!

- en: To Meta’s AI-powered image generator, apparently this is impossible to imagine.
    I tried dozens of times to create an image using prompts like “Asian man and Caucasian
    friend,” “Asian man and white wife,” and “Asian woman and Caucasian husband.”
    Only once was Meta’s image generator able to return an accurate image featuring
    the races I specified.

- en: Tweaking the text-based prompt didn’t seem to help. When I asked for an “Asian
    man and white woman smiling with a dog,” Meta’s text generator on Instagram gave
    me three back-to-back pictures of two Asian people. When I changed “white” to
    “Caucasian,” it did the same. “Asian man and Caucasian woman on wedding day” gave
    me an Asian man in a suit and an Asian woman in a traditional-looking garment...
    except upon further inspection, it appears to be a mix of a qipao and kimono.
    Multiculturalism is amazing.

- en: The image generator also didn’t like when I asked for representations of platonic
    relationships, like “Asian man with Caucasian friend” and “Asian woman and white
    friend.” Each time, it returned images of two Asian people. When I asked for a
    picture of an “Asian woman with Black friend,” the AI-generated image showed two
    Asian women. Tweaking it to “Asian woman with African American friend” yielded
    more accurate results.

- en: Interestingly, the tool performed slightly better when I specified South Asian
    people. It successfully created an image using the prompt “South Asian man with
    Caucasian wife” — before immediately creating an image of two South Asian people
    using the same prompt. The system also leaned heavily into stereotypes, like adding
    elements resembling a bindi and sari to the South Asian women it created without
    me asking for it.

- en: The image generator not being able to conceive of Asian people standing next
    to white people is egregious. But there are also more subtle indications of bias
    in what the system returns automatically. For example, I noticed Meta’s tool consistently
    represented “Asian women” as being East Asian-looking with light complexions,
    even though India is the most populous country in the world. It added culturally
    specific attire even when unprompted. It generated several older Asian men, but
    the Asian women were always young.

- en: The one image it successfully created used the prompt “Asian woman with Caucasian
    husband” and featured a noticeably older man with a young, light-skinned Asian
    woman — odd since I’m not trying to wade into [the age gap discourse](https://www.thecut.com/article/age-gap-relationships-marriage-younger-women-older-man.html).
    Immediately after, I generated another image using the same prompt, and it reverted
    back to showing an Asian man (also older) with an Asian woman.

    立即之后，我使用同样的提示生成了另一张图片，它又回到了展示一位亚洲男性（同样年长）与一位亚洲女性的情形。

- en: AI systems reflect the biases of their creators, trainers, and the data set
    they use. In US media, “Asian” is usually taken to mean an East Asian person,as
    opposed to people from other parts of the continent — perhaps it’s not surprising
    that Meta’s system assumes all “Asian” people look the same, when, in fact, we’re
    a diverse collection of people who often have little in common besides ticking
    the same census box.

  zh: AI系统反映了其创作者、训练者和数据集的偏见。 在美国媒体中，“亚洲人”通常被视为东亚人，而不是来自亚洲其他地区的人 - 当Meta的系统假设所有“亚洲”人看起来都一样时，也许并不奇怪，而事实上，我们是一个多样化的人群，除了在人口普查表中打勾外，通常没有太多共同之处。
- en: Asians who don’t fit into the monolith are essentially erased from the cultural
    consciousness, and even those who do are [underrepresented](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/asians-pacific-islanders-battle-invisibility-media-hollywood/story?id=77753812)
    in mainstream media. Asians are homogenized, exoticized, and relegated to “[perpetual
    foreigners](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/11/30/asian-americans-and-the-forever-foreigner-stereotype/).”
    Breaking type is easy in real life and impossible in Meta’s AI system. Once again,
    generative AI, rather than allowing the imagination to take flight, imprisons
    it within a formalization of society’s dumber impulses.

    亚裔被同质化，异化，并被隔离为“[永久外国人](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/11/30/asian-americans-and-the-forever-foreigner-stereotype/)”。
    在现实生活中打破类型是容易的，在Meta的人工智能系统中是不可能的。 再一次，生成式AI不是让想象飞翔，而是将其囚禁在社会愚蠢冲动的形式化中。
