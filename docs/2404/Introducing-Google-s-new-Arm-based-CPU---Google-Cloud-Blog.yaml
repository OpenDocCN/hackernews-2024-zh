    we’ve released five generations of Tensor Processing Units (TPU); in 2018 we released
    our first Video Coding Unit (VCU), achieving up to [33x](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446723)
    more efficiency for video transcoding; in 2021, we [doubled-down](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/systems/the-past-present-and-future-of-custom-compute-at-google?e=48754805)
    on custom compute by investing in “system on a chip” (SoC) designs, and released
    the [first of three generations](https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/)
    of Tensor chips for mobile devices.

- en: While our investments in compute accelerators have transformed our customers’
    capabilities, general-purpose compute is and will remain a critical portion of
    our customers’ workloads. Analytics, information retrieval, and ML training and
    serving all require a huge amount of compute power. Customers and users who wish
    to maximize performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet sustainability
    goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed recently. Amdahl’s
    Law suggests that as accelerators continue to improve, general purpose compute
    will dominate the cost and limit the capability of our infrastructure unless we
    make commensurate investments to keep up.

- en: Axion processors combine Google’s silicon expertise with Arm’s highest performing
    CPU cores to deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest
    general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today, up to 50% better
    performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency than comparable current-generation
    x86-based instances¹.  That’s why we’ve already started deploying Google services
    like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and
    the YouTube Ads platform on current generation Arm-based servers and plan to deploy
    and scale these services and more on Axion soon.

    a system of purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
    offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like networking and
    security, so Axion processors have more capacity and improved performance for
    customer workloads. Titanium also offloads storage I/O processing to [Hyperdisk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks),
    our new block storage service that decouples performance from instance size and
    that can be dynamically provisioned in real time.

    sustainability goals. Google Cloud data centers are already 1.5X more efficient
    than the industry average and deliver 3X more computing power with the same amount
    of electrical power compared with five years ago².  We’ve set ambitious [goals](https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/)
    to operate our offices, campuses, and data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7,
    and offer [tools](https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint) to help you report
    on carbon emissions. With Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more
    energy-efficiency.

    recently, we contributed to SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE), Arm’s hardware
    and firmware interoperability standard that ensures common operating systems and
    software packages can seamlessly run on Arm-based servers and VMs, making it easier
    for customers to deploy Arm workloads on Google Cloud with limited-if-any code
    rewrites. Through this collaboration, we’re accessing an ecosystem of tens of
    thousands of cloud customers already deploying workloads and leveraging Arm-native
    software from hundreds of ISVs and open-source projects.
