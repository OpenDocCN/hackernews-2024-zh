    1980 (though possibly informally in 1979 in Provo) with $2 million (around $7.5
    million in 2024) in funding from Safeguard Scientific. Crucially, Safeguard owned
    a controlling portion of NDSI as part of this funding deal. Canova was the the
    company’s first president while Davis was in charge of sales and marketing, and
    Warren Van Dyke Musser (Pete) of Safeguard was chairman. Their first building
    had previously been a truck dealership, and the company’s mission was to make
    computers and printers. Their first products were [Zilog](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-last-word-in-integrated-logic)
    Z-80 machines with 64K RAM and printers capable of around one hundred sixty characters
    per second. The company quickly grew to around one hundred twenty employees and
    created a few products that never went on sale but certainly cost money to design
    and prototype. From what I’ve been able to find, the only products from NDSI before
    1983 were the Nexus microcomputer series and the Image 800 printer series.

    BYU and received his Bachelor of Science from the university in 1980\. Along with
    Dale Neibaur and Kyle Powell, he founded SuperSet Software in Provo (essentially,
    just drive south on State St from Orem, which is south from Salt Lake City on
    I-15). SuperSet’s primary goal was to further develop and then to market networking
    technology that the three former classmates had worked on while attending BYU
    and the Eyring Research Institute. All of these technologies and the gentlemen’s
    research work had been for ARPANET projects, and most of these technologies were
    originally derivative works of Xerox’s XNS protocol but over time these became
    both the IPX (internetwork packet exchange) and SPX (sequenced packet exchange)
    protocols.

    they’d burned quite a bit of cash. As a general rule, investors like to make returns
    and they dislike losses. The company needed *something* to set their machines
    apart and drive sales. Someone thought it would be good to lean into networking.
    Accordingly, Novell hired SuperSet as consultants to help them develop that capability.
    This was an extremely good idea, as not long after, Safeguard sent Jack Messman
    to determine whether or not Novell was worth saving and serve as the company’s
    president for a time. He arrived to find Major, Neibaur, and Powell playing a
    game they’d written called Snipes. Normally, this wouldn’t be a good thing, but
    in this case, it was a great thing. The three men were on different computers
    (TRS-80, Commodore PET, Apple II), but they were playing together over a network.
    Messman reported back: “*You know, Pete, they''ve got something pretty interesting
    that they can do here with this networking.*” According to Musser, it was that
    single visit that kept Novell alive, but Davis first and then later Canova were
    fired. Through 1982 the company had no less than six different presidents, and
    the company was mired in chaos. While there was quite a bit of turn over in leadership,
    the company also laid off nearly all of its staff reducing head count to just
    fifteen.'

    the company allowed the company to demonstrate real network capabilities at the
    November COMDEX of 1982 and to attract quite a bit of attention. One person in
    particular who was attracted by this networking capability was Ray Noorda. Messman
    met him at COMDEX and from what I understand Jack Davis had previously recommended
    him to Safeguard/Novell as a potential candidate to lead the company. According
    to Musser, Noorda wasn’t one who was generally excitable, he wasn’t fond of many
    people, and he was a rather hard man. He was known for being a no-nonsense kind
    of person who could turn a company around and save it.

    Inc, and in April of that year Ray Noorda became the ninth president and the CEO
    of the newly renamed and brevity valuing company. Messman became chairman of the
    board and he represented Safeguard’s interests. Noorda and his remaining fifteen
    employees promptly set about completely changing the focus of the company. Novell
    would now focus on software and not hardware, and Noorda made this non-optional
    as he completely disbanded the hardware division of the company. Importantly,
    the company also formally acquired SuperSet in 1983, and subsequently, Drew Major

    and he borrowed another $1.3 million (around $4 million in 2024). For this, he
    gained a personal stake in the company of thirty three percent. He had tied his
    fortunes to Novell, and he was determined to win. The visionary idea he had was
    to take Major’s earlier disk and printer sharing network technologies and make
    it possible to do file sharing instead. Why lock a whole disk if you a person
    only requires a single file? This was Novell NetWare 1.0 that allowed users of
    the first true network operating system to access files on a server as if they
    were local. NetWare had a true dedicated server architecture, a specific and dedicated
    machine was the server and managed resources and services for clients. In a true
    stroke of genius, Novell thought about security from day one. Networks were still
    somewhat new in 1983, and most people hadn’t even begun to consider the security
    implications of the technology, but NetWare had both user authentication and access
    controls. Finally, while NetWare was initially IPX/SPX only, it was designed in
    such a way that it would be adaptable. Whatever the network topology was, NetWare
    would be there.

    just starting to penetrate the market with the PC XT having been released on the
    8th of March of that year. NetWare was there for the office that was wealthy enough
    to own both a hard disk or two and some networking equipment. The first version
    supported both PC-DOS and CP/M clients. The server hardware, however, was initially
    required to be a Motorola 68000 (NetWare 68) but this changed very quickly following
    the release of the XT. NetWare was ported to the Intel 8088/8086 (NetWare 86),
    and it began to gain support for a very wide variety of expansion cards. These
    were followed by Advanced NetWare 1.0 in 1985 which allowed for more than one
    server on any given network. Later that year (or early in 1986), Advanced NetWare
    1.2 was released with limited support for the 286 and its various features and
    improvements.

    8088/8086 in January of 1986, and for the 80286 in December of 1986\. NetWare
    2.0 for the 286 allowed for protected mode operation, use of 16MB of RAM, better
    multitasking, larger volume size limits, and RAM disk caches for frequently accessed
    files. All of this taken together increased performance significantly which made
    larger networks more feasible. NetWare 2 supported more hardware from its first
    day on the market, and it supported all major network configurations of the day
    (ARCNET, Token Ring, Ethernet). What’s more, NetWare 2 also supported Loadable
    Modules (NLMs). This feature allowed both Novell and third parties to release
    add-on software with new capabilities such as database servers, backup solutions,
    anti-virus programs, mail, groupware suites, and much more. Third parties had
    been making add-on products for NetWare as early as April of 1983, but NetWare
    Loadable Modules brought standards and an official status to the various services
    that add-ons enabled.

- en: 'NetWare 2 for 286 improved on other versions in another way that allowed Novell
    to position its network solution as an alternative to minicomputers and mainframes:
    fault tolerance. This included things like read-after-write verification, bad-block
    remapping done during the course of normal operation, software RAID, transaction
    tracking (so an incomplete write could be reversed), and support for up to four
    network cards in concurrent use. A standard license for NetWare was for one hundred
    clients. From what I can find, most Novell customers at this time bought pre-assembled
    and purpose built servers when going for that standard license. The cost was then
    determined based upon the hardware and client count with typical pricing ranging
    from $4500 to $12000\. If one were to purchase NetWare only, the pricing was around
    $2000 (roughly $5600 in 2024) depending upon precisely which version, client count,
    and feature set was desired. This price could go up to $4995 (around $14000 in
    2024) if a company wished for every feature. For the price conscious, any random
    286-based machine could run the server with an introductory price for four concurrent
    users of $595 (this was referred to as ELS NetWare [ELS stands for Entry Level
    Solution], cost around $1700 in 2024). This entry level system could later be
    upgraded to ELS II with support for eight concurrent users at a discounted price,
    though I haven’t found what that price was as most ads advise purchasers to call
    the software vendor. With the full NetWare 2 286 release, a dedicated server could
    serve bootable disk images for clients as long as those clients’ boot ROMs or
    BIOS had NetWare network boot capabilities, but the ELS versions of NetWare lacked
    this ability.'

- en: In 1987, Novell re-entered the hardware market albeit in a rather modest way.
    The company felt that a primary issue in driving NetWare adoption was the dearth
    of affordable network hardware. Their answer, released in February, was the NE1000\.
    This was an 8 bit card based off of the National Semiconductor 8390\. The first
    versions were branded as the *E-Net adapter* and priced at just $395 (around $1000
    in 2024) while many competitors’ products were closer to $600\. A 16 bit card,
    the NE2000, was released in 1988 at a price of $495 (about $1300 in 2024). Both
    cards were designed using off-the-shelf components and manufactured by Eagle (an
    arm of Anthem Technologies). Novell’s distributors would actually order and purchase
    these cards directly from Eagle and not from Novell. Novell simply received a
    royalty for their design work. The company also permitted other companies to clone
    their designs. For Novell, more network cards meant a larger potential market
    for network software, and that was a market in which their influence was very
    swiftly rising. The NE1000 and NE2000 were wildly successful selling at nearly
    twenty thousand per month. The cards’ status as a top seller was further cemented
    in 1989 when the prices were lowered to $295 (about $738 in 2024) for the NE1000
    and $345 (around $863 in 2024) for the NE2000.

    of the network interface card market wasn’t enough. There were still all of these
    minicomputers and mainframes out there without Novell’s involvement and I suppose
    that this fact annoyed Noorda? So, making headlines on the 1st of February in
    1987, Novell purchased CXI. CXI specialized in making equipment and software that
    allowed the integration of IBM PCs and compatibles into networks of IBM mainframes
    and terminals. This acquisition involved a stock swap valued at around $34 million
    (around $93 million in 2024) and made CXI a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell.
    In October of that same year, CXI introduced an IBM PS/2 add-in board that would
    connect PS/2s to both IBM mainframes and NetWare LANs. The board cost $545 (around
    $1489 in 2024) and came with software to enable all of the various functionality
    required.

    as the company president, and Doug as the VP and lead software developer. Their
    primary product was called Btrieve, a transactional database program. It was pretty
    neat. The early versions for PC-DOS ran as a TSR providing an API to the database
    engine. Later versions featured network access capabilities and multi-user functionality
    and record locking. This wasn’t a cheap product priced at nearly $1000 (about
    $3000 in 2024) but applications built using Btrieve’s TSR could be distributed
    without a royalty. By 1985, SoftCraft’s products were seeing significant use in
    the finance sector, and more than five thousand developers were building products
    on their APIs. Novell acquired the company in 1987\. Nancy Woodward became the
    VP and GM of Novell’s presence in Austin while Doug became the VP of Advanced
    Database Technologies. The first fruit of this was released that same year with
    Btrieve being present on NetWare 2.15 as a value added process. Expanding their
    products with mainframes and databases was successful, and Novell closed 1988
    with sales passing $347 million (roughly $910 million in 2024) and a market share
    over fifty percent.

    network operating system operating in protected mode, with dynamically loadable/unloadable
    drivers, a C language API and a library set for NetWare loadable modules, with
    better support for both Macintosh and UNIX clients, supporting far larger disks,
    much more memory, and it cached the entire file allocation table in memory greatly
    which increased performance. NetWare 3.0 did not, however, have preemptive multitasking,
    and all NLMs ran in ring 0\. As a result of these two shortcomings, NetWare 3.0
    did little to improve upon NetWare’s reliability which wasn’t bad by the standards
    of the day, but not exactly amazing either. Performance was simply deemed more
    important at the time. Yet, while the system itself may not have been more reliable,
    version 3’s network communications certainly were. Version 3 saw the introduction
    of the NetWare Core Protocol which was an overhaul of the IPX/SPX implementation
    that brought uniformity to the way file, print, and other services were handled.
    With NCP, Novell brought better authentication as well as stronger encryption
    to the product. This version also saw Novell introduce the NetWare Link Services
    Protocol which was an improved routing protocol that allowed for more efficient
    scaling and thus much larger networks. NetWare 3.0 was still configured and administered
    using text-based utilities and lacked a graphical user interface.

    setting, it was almost certainly a Novell server as the company’s products claimed
    an easy monopoly with somewhere from sixty five to possibly ninety percent of
    the market and sales of $497.5 million (almost $1.2 billion in 2024). The company
    had a strong presence in Europe, South America, and Asia, and made a strong push
    into Japan in 1990/1991\. By the end of 1991, half of Novell’s annual revenue
    was from locations outside of the USA. Corvus had filed for bankruptcy a few years
    earlier, and Banyan VINES and Artisoft LANtastic were battling for that remaining
    minority percentage of the market. The company began changing around this same
    time. [Microsoft’s NT](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-windows-nt-31)

- en: On the 12th of December in 1991, Novell announced a joint venture with AT&T
    named Univel, headquartered in San Jose, that aimed to develop the Destiny desktop
    UNIX operating system. Novell held the controlling share in the venture with fifty
    five percent, and the bulk of the engineering efforts took place in Sandy, Utah.
    The basis for this system was UNIX SVR4.2 with the MoOLIT toolkit providing the
    looks of either OPEN LOOK or MOTIF depending upon the user’s preferences. This
    system made use of virtual filesystems as a descendent of SVR4, and it allowed
    support for VxFS or UFS as root, featured both TCP/IP and IPX networking, and
    it had DOS compatibility via DOS Merge 3 (essentially VDMs) and DR-DOS 6\. This
    system became known as UnixWare upon its release in 1992\. From articles of the
    time period, Novell made the assumption that UnixWare’s desktop release would
    only ever require NetWare, and their *Portable NetWare* packages for UNIX became
    *NetWare for UNIX* although overhauled for this first party effort. The Advanced
    Server edition of UnixWare is the release that featured IPX, SPX, and TCP/IP.
    The other notable difference between the two was that the desktop release only
    supported two concurrent users while the Advanced Server had no limit. Despite
    lowering its prices in April of 1993, Univel couldn’t move units. On the 21st
    of December in 1992, Novell announced its intentions to acquire USL including
    all of the UNIX copyrights, trademarks, and licensing contracts. This was completed
    by June of 1993\. USL was folded into the Novell UNIX Systems Group and moved
    to Utah. Shortly after the acquisition, Joel Appelbaum, former Univel President
    & CEO, and Roel Pieper, former CEO of USL, resigned. UnixWare 1.1 was released
    in December of 1993.

- en: To compete with Microsoft Windows 3, Novell intended to add rich networking
    capabilities to a multitasking version of DR-DOS and then use GEM as a graphical
    environment. Don’t think of this as DOS though. After booting into the 16 bit
    DR-DOS environment with which many of us are familiar, the system loaded Vladivar,
    a 32 bit preemptively multitasking, multithreaded, operating system kernel featuring
    hardware virtualization, scheduling, dynamically loadable device drivers, and
    namespaces. This software was previously used for isolated virtual DOS machines,
    but was modified and repurposed to be a more general OS kernel. However, the possibility
    of legal action from Apple over GEM’s look and feel presented a problem. Accordingly,
    Novell’s head of marketing, Darrell Miller, reached out to Apple’s CEO, John Sculley,
    about porting System 7 to the 486\. Sculley agreed, and on the 14th of February
    in 1992, project Star Trek began with a scheduled prototype completion date set
    for the 31st of October. Yeah… about that… classic MacOS was largely written in
    Motorola 68k assembly language. The newer Pascal bits were certainly easier to
    port, but the 68k and the 486 are very different CPUs. Additionally, the Macintosh
    was heavily reliant on ROMs. This porting effort would be a rather Herculean task.
    Ultimately, the ROMs were implemented as software that would run on Valdivar,
    many of the assembly language bits were rewritten in a higher level language,
    and a functional prototype was indeed delivered but a bit late, the 1st of December.
    They did overshoot the goal though. The prototype had working QuickDraw GX and
    QuickTime. Despite delivering the working product, the project was cancelled at
    Apple when Michael Spindler took over as CEO. Novell then released the updated
    DOS environment without Apple’s bits and bytes as Novell DOS 7 with TASKMGR providing
    the multitasking controls and also providing an API for GUIs to leverage within
    EMM386\. Unrelated to our main topic, some of Apple’s code rewriting helped in
    the transition to PowerPC and the file-based ROMs were later used in the iMac.

    also introduced filesystem level compression, public/private key encryption, and
    NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface which allowed the server to share multiple
    serial devices like modems with clients via port redirection. By this point, clients
    had been made at some point in time for machines on all available x86 chips, 68k

    this, he’d been at Bell Labs, PARC, and [Sun](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-network-is-the-computer).
    The company he took over was decidedly moribund. From 1995 forward, all of NetWare’s
    major operating system competitors shipped with networking support out of the
    box. In particular, Noorda’s fears had materialized more strongly than anyone
    may have thought; Windows NT was good. It provided file and print services on
    a network, and it could also run applications. Unlike NetWare, NT was exceedingly
    easy to use and the entire system could be administered graphically. NT was also
    truly and fully preemptively multitasking, and perhaps most importantly for small
    businesses… NT was cheaper. NT was better than NetWare in many ways, and NT was
    cheaper than NetWare. While NetWare had emphasized speed and security above all
    else, it was a worse product in every other way for many users. In a very short
    time (start of 1997), NT had taken forty three percent of the network operating
    system market, and Novell’s NetWare had fallen to just thirty three percent.

    feet for its twelve hundred employees. The company didn’t end up moving into their
    new offices for a few years, but the construction and costs started in the era
    of Schmidt’s joining the company.

    lawsuits against LG and Super Resources alleging copyright and trademark infringement.
    Novell claimed that the two companies had used upgraded serial numbers for NetWare
    and had then sold them as new products to unwitting end-users. Novell claimed
    that these end-users were not entitled to the upgrade product as they hadn’t been
    previous license holders. This was not the first lawsuit of this kind. The company
    had filed a similar suit against Aqua Systems in 1994, which had been settled
    in August of 1995.

    and Novell started a joint venture named Novonyx. The idea with Novonyx was to
    create an enterprise webserver for both intranet and internet use-cases that would
    work on Novell NetWare. Novell closed 1997 with $1 billion (nearly $2 billion
    in 2024) in revenue and a $78 million (about $151 million in 2024) loss.

    in October of 1998 and shipped with Netscape’s FastTrack webserver instead. This
    version of NetWare shifted the default network protocol to TCP/IP, had full GUI
    support, introduced Novell Storage Services as the default filesystem, added a
    JVM, introduced Novel Distribution Print Services, added pubkey support to directory
    services along with DNS and DHCP, added support for SANs, and added clustering
    support. This release was a success with just over a million copies installed,
    a higher figure than NetWare’s competition, and returned the company to profitability
    with nearly $1 billion in revenue and $102 million (about $194 million in 2024)
    in income.

    Windows NT, many resellers dropped NetWare altogether, recertified their Novell
    Certified Engineers as Microsoft Certified Professionals, and severed all ties
    with Novell. Sadly for Novell, 1999 proved to be the year that Windows NT truly
    won the fight with two million copies sold, roughly double NetWare. Yet, Novell
    was still profitable with nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $191 million (around
    $355 million in 2024) in income.

    Novell had always offered some services in addition to its software, the software
    was always the clear focus. Shifting to services simply wasn’t something in which
    the company had any deep expertise, and they were losing money fast, so there
    wasn’t really time enough to build that expertise internally. The solution was
    found in Cambridge Technology Partners at which Jack Messman was CEO. He also
    happened to have a board seat at Novell. The acquisition was announced on the
    13th of March in 2001 and it was completed on the 9th of July in 2001\. Jack Messman
    became CEO of the company, while Eric Schmidt remained chairman and chief strategist.
    On the 11th of July, Messman gave his first address to the unified company stating
    an intent to “*leverage synergies and execute on an innovative go-to-market strategy
    in order to best deliver on existing market opportunity.*” Schmidt had joined
    the board of Google as chairman in March of 2001, became CEO of Google in August,
    and he subsequently left Novell behind. After the CTP acquisition, Novell relocated
    to Cambridge, Massachusetts but the company chose to keep technical development
    work in Provo, Utah. In October of 2001, Novell released NetWare 6\. This release
    greatly simplified the licensing scheme for NetWare, and it added the ability
    for remote users to access intranet services. Novell lost $273 million in 2001
    (around $478 million in 2024).

    was Microsoft on one side and Linux on the other. In response the company did
    what it had done so well in the past, it made two more acquisitions. In August
    of 2003, Novell purchased Ximian who made Evolution (an enterprise style email
    client) and Mono (an opensource .Net implementation). In November of 2003, Novell
    purchased SuSE.

    This release brought quite a bit of open source software into NetWare with a GNU
    userland, MySQL database, and PHP while also extending quite a bit of functionality
    to the web. This final version gave NetWare customers USB storage support, a Java
    application server, and encrypted volume support. As a sign of Novell’s changing
    fortunes, however, administrators could synchronize their NetWare directory with
    either a Windows NT domain or with Active Directory. I imagine that this was the
    route through which most customers left NetWare altogether.'

    Novell in the Utah state court system. SCO’s hope was to have Novell remove all
    claims to UNIX. That case ended in Novell’s favor on the 9th of June in 2004,
    and Novell filed a counter suit against SCO on the 29th of July in 2005 with multiple
    claims. This ended on the 10th of August in 2007 with Novell being named the owner
    of both UNIX and UnixWare copyrights and with SCO being required to pay Novell
    its portion of profit from the Sun and Microsoft UNIX licenses. Before any payments
    could be made, SCO filed for bankruptcy. This move didn’t work out for the Santa
    Cruz Operation, and they were denied a stay. Appeals and motions were made, but
    on the 30th of August in 2011, an appeals court affirmed everything in Novell’s
    favor.
