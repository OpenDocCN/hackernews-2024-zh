## Intro to Claude models

Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus are the next generation of Claude models. They are state-of-the-art text and vision models that can generate human-like text outputs based on both image and text inputs. With powerful vision capabilities, they open up exciting possibilities for computer vision and image understanding applications. Opus, the most powerful model, offers unparalleled intelligence, reasoning, and creativity on a wide range of tasks, while Haiku offers plenty of capability at very high speed and low cost. Sonnet offers a great balance between the two.

## Getting started

Jump right in with our [quickstart guide](/en/docs/quickstart-guide) and learn how to make your first API call in minutes. Or check out the [prompt library](/en/prompt-library) or our [intro to prompting](/en/docs/intro-to-prompting) guide to learn more about prompting.

### Prompt engineering

Learn best practices and strategies for designing effective prompts to get the most out of Claude with our [prompt engineering guide](/en/docs/prompt-engineering).

### Anthropic cookbook

If you learn prompting better in combination with code and applied examples of interesting use cases, visit the [Anthropic cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook?tab=readme-ov-file#anthropic-cookbook) instead. There you’ll find copy-able code that demonstrate how to use Claude in neat and effective ways in more advanced scenarios, such as [uploading PDFs](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/misc/pdf%5Fupload%5Fsummarization.ipynb), [tool use and function calling](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/function%5Fcalling/function%5Fcalling.ipynb), [embeddings](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/third%5Fparty/voyageai/how%5Fto%5Fcreate%5Fembeddings.md), and more.

> With the developer [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and the [claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) chatbot, you can experiment with prompts right in your browser.

### Claude 3 technical presentation

If you’re more of a visual learner, check out our [Claude 3 technical presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTOOynV%5F8%5F14nJZMBf4nDDikuF5aLH-2yzTAayBd9bEBgWB5J4WmwZ92fVziwEKROkhgpanN5E3vopI/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) for a visual overview of some of the content also covered in our documentation.
