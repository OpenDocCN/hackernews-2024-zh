    you answered it. With the advent of caller ID, you’d only pick up if it was someone
    you recognized. And now, with spoofing and robocalls, it can seem like a gamble
    to pick up the phone, period. In 2023, [robocall blocking service Youmail](https://robocallindex.com/)
    estimates there were [more than 55 billion robocalls](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/16/americans-received-55-million-robocalls-in-2023-a-9-jump-from-2022/)
    in the United States. How did robocalls proliferate so much that now they seem
    to be dominating phone networks? And [can any of this be undone](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-your-phone-company-aims-to-stop-robocalls)?
    **[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/)**spoke with [David Frankel of ZipDX](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfrankel2),
    who’s been fighting robocalls for over a decade, to find out.

    and a friend of mine called me [about a contest](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2013/04/ftc-announces-robocall-challenge-winners)
    that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was starting. They were seeking the public’s
    help to find solutions to the robocall problem. I spent time and energy putting
    together a contest entry. I didn’t win, but I became so engrossed in the problem,
    and like a dog with a bone, I just haven’t let go of it.'

- en: '**Frankel:** Well, I don’t know the answer, because I don’t feel like we’ve
    succeeded yet. I’ve been very involved in something called[traceback](https://tracebacks.org/)—in
    fact, it was my FTC contest entry. It’s a semiautomated process where, in fact,
    with the cooperation of individual phone companies, you go from telco A to B to
    C to D, until you ultimately get somebody that sent that call. And then you can
    find the customer who paid them to put this call on the network.'

    We’ve got tens of thousands of telephone numbers that just wait for robocalls.
    We can correlate that with other data and reveal where these calls are coming
    from. Ideally, we stop them at the source. It’s a sort of sewage that’s being
    pumped into the telephone network. We want to go upstream to find the source of
    the sewage and deal with it there.

- en: '**Frankel:** Well, regulations are really, really tough for a couple of reasons.
    One is, it’s a bureaucratic, slow-moving process. It’s also a cat-and-mouse game,
    because, as quick as you start talking about new regulations, people start talking
    about how to circumvent them.'

    Committee, the loudest voices come from the telecommunications operators. There’s
    an imbalance in the control that the consumer ultimately has over who gets to
    invade their telephone versus these other interests.

    not substantially reduced from where it’s been. We made progress on explicit fraud
    calls, but we still have too many of these lead-generation calls. We need to get
    this whacked down by 80 percent. I always think that we’re on the cusp of doing
    that, that this year is going to be the year. There are people attacking this
    from a number of different angles. Everybody says there’s no silver bullet, and
    I believe that, but I hope that we’re about to crest the hill.'

    to retire, having something to show for our efforts. I don’t think we’ll get it
    to zero. But I think that we’ll be able to push the genie a long way back into
    the bottle. The measure of success is that we all won’t be scared to answer our
    phone. It’ll be a surprise that it’s a robocall—instead of the expectation that
    it’s a robocall.'
