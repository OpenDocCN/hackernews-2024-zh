    two sides are tenants and landlords. In the private US housing market, such face-to-face
    negotiating sessions are rare. This one, however, which lasted for two hours,
    resulted in huge wins for the tenants.

    improved language access, transparency of maintenance contracts, firing of a building
    manager, resolving of code and maintenance issues, lowering of monthly rents to
    their July 2022 and May 2023 levels (when the landlord was first notified of the
    buildings’ respective habitability issues), and a 90 percent rent refund for all
    tenants from those dates totaling more than $1 million across the two buildings.

    had spent over a year maximizing their leverage. They had formed tenants associations
    in their buildings, built strike-ready majorities, and launched majority rent
    strikes in October 2023 alongside other members of the citywide Veritas Tenants
    Association (VTA) against their then landlord, [Veritas Investments, Inc.](https://jacobin.com/2022/06/corporate-landlords-ca-tenants-unions-finance)
    — which had just [defaulted](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/veritas-landlord-18091162.php)
    on a nearly $1 billion–dollar loan on two separate portfolios backed by more than
    2,450 rent-stabilized units — demanding a say in the terms of sale of their homes.

    by California Civil Code 1942.4, which prohibits landlords from collecting rents,
    raising rents, or issuing three-day “pay-or-quit” notices if buildings violate
    specific health or safety codes and those issues are not abated within thirty-five
    days of inspection and notification by a public officer. When Brookfield Properties
    and Ballast Investments won an auction for the majority of Veritas’s delinquent
    loan and subsequently assumed ownership of the larger portfolio, they inherited
    the outstanding habitability issues, the rent strike, and tenants prepared to
    leverage their power at the point of transfer to change the terms and conditions
    of their housing.

    granted by San Francisco’s “[Union at Home Ordinance](https://www.sf.gov/news/new-legislation-tenant-organizing-and-tenant-associations),”
    which was passed in 2022 and has the potential to make collective bargaining sessions
    like the one that took place in February at the HRC office more common. Union
    at Home, which was spearheaded by Supervisor Aaron Peskin and formulated with
    input from the VTA, HRC, and other tenant and labor groups, is the first of its
    kind in the private US housing market — similar legislation was passed for US
    Department of Housing and Urban Development–subsidized housing in 2000 — and guarantees
    tenants’ right to organize while obligating landlords to bargain with tenants
    associations.

- en: Specifically, the ordinance grants the legal right to certify a tenants association
    in buildings with more than five units provided a majority of residents sign on
    (50 percent plus one unit). It also enshrines the right to hold tenant meetings,
    door-knock, distribute literature, and invite nonresident advocates or guests
    into the building for organizing purposes. Furthermore, it requires landlords
    to attend quarterly meetings if requested and to meet and confer with tenants
    associations “in good faith.”

    official “housing service” on par with electricity, water, or trash removal. If
    a landlord fails to comply or interferes with any organizing activities — for
    instance, refuses to negotiate in good faith — tenants can petition San Francisco’s
    Rent Board, which oversees and implements the Rent Ordinance, for rent reductions
    due to a decrease in housing services. While under the ordinance tenants associations
    are building-specific, tenants can continue to organize and build leverage with
    other tenants in the same landlord portfolio or citywide, and even pursue joint
    negotiations as the Geary Street and Leavenworth Street tenants did.

    restrictions on municipal rent regulation due to California’s Costa-Hawkins Rental
    Housing Act and proliferating corporate landlord ownership and “[corporate landlord
    practices](https://jacobin.com/2022/06/corporate-landlords-ca-tenants-unions-finance)”
    among landlords both big and small. In this climate, novel pro-tenant legislation
    can help mediate the severe power imbalance between tenant and landlord, which
    has been further skewed by rental-housing financialization. It does so by establishing
    a right to organize enforced not by the state, which has [repeatedly failed](https://jacobin.com/2022/12/landlords-los-angeles-tenant-protections-housing-department)
    to pass adequate or enforce existing tenant rights and protections, but by tenants
    themselves, using rent as a point of leverage. The Union at Home legislation places
    agency with tenants as opposed to public officials or lawyers, while imposing
    demands on landlords and making the penalty for violating the ordinance financial,
    as opposed to legal.

    developed by the UC Berkeley Labor Center, San Francisco tenants across fifty
    buildings formed tenants associations in the first year after Union at Home took
    effect — accounting for more than one thousand units — and brought forward a range
    of issues for negotiation. These included repairs and repair timelines, rent increases

    eviction filings, utility charges, communication protocols, and issues surrounding

    Francisco Community Land Trust on selling the building when funding becomes available,

    the right to bargain collectively and leverage the power built through organizing
    and/or withholding rent — with the potential for transformative victories. Where
    governments and policies have failed to limit unfettered landlord power, or in
    some cases directly restrict governments’ ability to do so, this type of legislation
    can help tenants redress the unequal power dynamics of the housing sector, provided
    they organize, and enable the negotiation of leases, rights, and rents not permissible
    under Costa-Hawkins. The threat this poses to landlords is clear, as the reaction
    of Berkeley’s real estate lobby to the new ballot initiative shows.

    ballot measure — the “Renters Relief & Homeowners Protection Act” — aimed at weakening
    the Rent Board, reducing tenant and habitability protections, and further deregulating

    a watered-down version of the right to organize, which requires a two-thirds majority
