    days of inspection and notification by a public officer. When Brookfield Properties

    door-knock, distribute literature, and invite nonresident advocates or guests

    among landlords both big and small. In this climate, novel pro-tenant legislation
    can help mediate the severe power imbalance between tenant and landlord, which
    has been further skewed by rental-housing financialization. It does so by establishing
    a right to organize enforced not by the state, which has [repeatedly failed](https://jacobin.com/2022/12/landlords-los-angeles-tenant-protections-housing-department)
    to pass adequate or enforce existing tenant rights and protections, but by tenants
    themselves, using rent as a point of leverage. The Union at Home legislation places
    agency with tenants as opposed to public officials or lawyers, while imposing
    demands on landlords and making the penalty for violating the ordinance financial,
    as opposed to legal.

  zh: 提案的支持者希望这项法案将促进该市租户组织和谈判的激增，扩大并加强该市的租户运动。“最终，这只会随着组织的增强而变得更加强大，”西蒙-韦斯伯格坚称。“要让50%的租户支持任何事情，这是一种相当了不起的组织。这本身将改变事态。但是，如果我们在伯克利甚至只有十座主要是学生的建筑中设有租户协会，这将极大地改变事态。”
- en: Unsurprisingly, there has been pushback from landlords in both San Francisco
    and Berkeley. In San Francisco, some landlords have stalled, refused to negotiate
    in good faith or altogether, or agreed to implement small changes while refusing
    to discuss more substantive issues, forcing tenants to pursue mediation and arbitration
    through the Rent Board.

  zh: 在旧金山和伯克利，房东群体显然对此有所反击。在旧金山，一些房东拖延时间，拒绝善意协商，或完全不予理会，或同意实施小的变动，却拒绝讨论更为实质性的问题，迫使租户通过租房委员会寻求调解和仲裁。
- en: In response, the Board of Supervisors passed an amended version of Union at
    Home in October 2023, which strengthened the language around good faith negotiation
    and included accommodations for monolingual tenants. In Berkeley, meanwhile, the
    Berkeley Property Owners Association has begun collecting signatures for its own
    ballot measure — the “Renters Relief & Homeowners Protection Act” — aimed at weakening
    the Rent Board, reducing tenant and habitability protections, and further deregulating
    rent control. Seemingly in an attempt to confuse voters, the measure also includes
    a watered-down version of the right to organize, which requires a two-thirds majority
    to establish a tenants association, doesn’t make organizing a “housing service,”
    and limits the definition of “good faith,” while preventing the Rent Board from
    defining it further.

  zh: 在此回应中，监事会于2023年10月通过了修订版的“Union at Home”，加强了关于善意协商的措辞，并为单语租户提供了住宿安排。与此同时，在伯克利，伯克利房地产业主协会已经开始为其自己的选民提案“租户救济与房主保护法案”收集签名，旨在削弱租房委员会，减少租户和居住条件的保护，并进一步取消租金管制。看似试图让选民困惑，该提案还包括了一个稀释版本的组织权利，需要以三分之二多数来成立租户协会，不把组织视为“住房服务”，并限制了“善意”的定义，同时阻止租房委员会进一步定义它。
- en: The countercampaign by the landlord lobby is well funded and craftily misleading,
    and underscores the need for legislation that recalibrates the power imbalance
    between tenant and landlord. But Rosenblum-Sellers is not discouraged, telling

  zh: 房东游说团体的反对运动资金充裕且狡猾，强调了需要重新调整租户与房东之间权力失衡的立法。但罗森布鲁姆-塞勒斯并不气馁，对《Jacobin》说道：
- en: It’s no surprise that wealthy interest groups representing landlords don’t want
    to see our power increased and their power diminished. But I’m confident we’re
    going to win. We have the organizing game, and just like there was a huge appetite
    for a contract campaign around eradicating the rent burden for UAW members at
    UC Berkeley and getting our wages to match the cost of living, I think there’s
    a lot of appetite in the City of Berkeley for transformational progressive policies
    like this one.

  zh: 富裕的房东利益集团不愿看到我们的力量增强而他们的力量减弱，这一点并不奇怪。但我确信我们会赢。我们掌握了组织的技巧，就像在加州大学伯克利分校为消除租金负担和使我们的工资与生活成本相匹配而进行的劳工联盟成员合同运动中有巨大的需求一样，我认为伯克利市也有很多对这类变革性进步政策的需求。
