    into Ford’s hands-free driver-assistance system, BlueCruise, after it was found
    to be active during [two recent crashes](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/ford-bluecruise-fatal-crash-investigation-stationary-suv/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKwXHXIAxURT-9dLB48DCXhKlsfimfQHRIKSyD5wjWDm42hBFLan2mkI0o7phiIHTrF8BJ6SYGgOXftjwXNj-OgYbjH-38D2aDCM8s2UzZOawy4JXNeK4vkCksit7-cXa3K2aOwKHxhe6uTDPRFrZq6I75AWfaWpH3IyHjw6oWw1) that

- en: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation
    (ODI) said on Monday that it has confirmed BlueCruise was active in both crashes.
    One of the crashes happened in February in Texas, and the other occurred in early
    April in Pennsylvania. They are the first known fatalities resulting from crashes
    involving the use of BlueCruise.

- en: The investigation into the two crashes ratchets up the scrutiny on BlueCruise,
    which is currently available on the Mustang Mach-E, and certain Ford F-150s (including
    the Lightning), Explorers and Expeditions. The National Transportation Safety
    Board has already [opened an investigation](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/ford-bluecruise-fatal-crash-investigation-stationary-suv/)
    into the Texas crash. Ford said in a statement that it is “working with NHTSA
    to support its investigation.”

    investigation to date](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-closed-fatal-crashes/).
    The safety agency [initially opened](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/)
    an investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot in 2021 after multiple reports of Teslas
    crashing into stationary emergency vehicles while the drivers were using Autopilot.
    In closing the investigation, the ODI said last week that it determined a “critical
    safety gap between drivers’ expectations of [Autopilot’s] operating capabilities
    and the system’s true capabilities” created “foreseeable misuse and avoidable
    crashes.”

- en: Ford announced BlueCruise in 2021\. It is only available on pre-mapped highways,
    and Ford pairs it with a camera-based driver monitoring system that checks whether
    drivers’ eyes are still on the road when the system is active. Those represent
    much tighter constraints on the system than Tesla puts on the use of Autopilot.

- en: Still, while BlueCruise is highly rated by some, including [Consumer Reports](https://reprints.theygsgroup.com/cr/reprints/FordBlueCruise.pdf),
    the recent crashes and resulting investigations suggest there may be a more fundamental
    problem with advanced driver-assistance systems than some of these companies are
    willing to admit.
