- en: One of the most unique features of the Google AI Studio is that various file
    types can be used in the environment. These include images, videos, audio, and
    files from Google Drive. This means that developers can easily test out if their
    idea works, and how to work through any bugs. For example, if we use the Chat
    Prompt from above and add a video we want summarized, the model will access the
    inserted video and accomplish its task. Let’s take a look.

    When prompted, the model can interact with the video and produce a summary of
    its contents. These types of use cases can’t be done in other AI Playgrounds (OpenAI
    for example).
