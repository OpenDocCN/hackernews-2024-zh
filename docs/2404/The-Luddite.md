It seems your Javascript is turned off. Maybe you'd prefer the

[RSS](/feed.rss)

feed? Please, do not write in about this. When I started this blog, I never thought that anyone would read it, and I was fooling around with a home-brewed client-side templating system. It's still a totally free website with no ads and an RSS feed. If you feel very strongly about it, I would welcome a financial sponsorship to migrate, and I'll even put up a "thank you" banner for you and/or your company. Otherwise, I'd rather spend my unpaid non-work time writing more posts than migrating off a system that frankly works pretty well for me. Thank you for understanding.
