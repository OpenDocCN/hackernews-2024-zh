    burn more calories, as the body finds sneaky ways to adapt by cutting energy use
    elsewhere. But what makes exercise ineffective for weight loss might explain why
    it's so good for our health — working out could divert excess energy from potentially
    harmful bodily processes like inflammation and stress, according to Pontzer.

- en: Working out to lose weight is based on the assumption that we burn calories
    at a constant rate. In this theory, if walking one mile burns 50 calories, then
    walking 100 miles over the course of a month would burn 5,000 calories. Theoretically,
    this could help you spend more energy than you consume, and prompt your body to
    dip into stored energy by burning fat.

    with the Hadza, a group of indigenous inhabitants of Tanzania, who walk miles
    each day as part of a traditional hunter gatherer lifestyle.

    calories each day than the average sedentary American adult, far fewer than expected
    given their very high activity levels.

    curve, meaning that the more you exercise, the more carefully your body budgets
    energy.

    to stick to the same calorie budget whether you're training for a marathon or
    chilling on the couch — what he calls "the constrained energy framework."

    so good for us](https://www.businessinsider.com/study-high-intensity-workouts-boost-health-in-people-over-70-2020-10).
    After weeks or months of exercise, your body starts to reallocate calories from
    other activities to compensate, Pontzer's evidence suggests.

    immune system, for instance, is important for keeping you alive, but can cause
    damage if it's overactive, leading to issues from [allergies to autoimmune disorders](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/disorders-of-the-immune-system).
