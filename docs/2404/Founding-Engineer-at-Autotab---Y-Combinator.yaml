- en: Autotab is the first digital robot that controls a computer like a human. It
    excels at the highly repetitive tasks that make up the worst parts of modern knowledge
    work. If we succeed, we will provide the platform that unlocks the next 100x productivity
    increase, and frees humans from trillions of hours of soul-crushing work.

- en: We are second time founders backed by OpenAI and YCombinator. We are live in
    production and are working with some of the biggest companies you use every day
    to handle critical tasks that humans used to do. We’re rapidly scaling up to meet
    demand, and building a 5-person founding team where everyone builds product and
    talks to users.
