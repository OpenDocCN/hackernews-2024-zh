    unit for spacecraft that uses nuclear fusion-enhanced pulsed plasma.

    that uses a form of aneutronic nuclear fusion to boost its performance.

- en: According to Rocketstart, its propulsion system’s base thruster generates high
    speed protons through the ionization of water vapor. When these protons collide
    with the nucleus of a boron atom, the atom undergoes fusion, transforming into
    a high-energy form of carbon that rapidly decays into three alpha particles.

- en: By introducing boron into the thruster’s exhaust, the FireStar Drive enables
    this fusion process. Similar to the way an afterburner enhances thrust in a jet
    engine by introducing fuel into the exhaust, the fusion occurring in the thruster’s
    exhaust significantly improves its performance.

- en: The fusion process was first devised during a R&D program for the US Air Force’s
    AFWERX (Air Force Work Project) initiative, where boronated water was introduced
    into the pulsed plasma thruster’s exhaust plume. This created alpha particles
    and gamma rays, clear indications of nuclear fusion.

    Georgia Institute of Technology’s High Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory (HPEPL)
    in Atlanta, USA. During the tests the process was seen to create the ionizing
    radiation and improve the base propulsion unit’s thrust by 50%, said RocketStar.

    said,  “RocketStar has not just incrementally improved a propulsion system, but
    taken a leap forward by applying a novel concept, creating a fusion-fission reaction
    in the exhaust. This is an exciting time in technology development, and I am looking
    forward to their future innovations.”

- en: Chris Craddock, CEO of RocketStar said, “We are thrilled at the results of our
    initial testing on an idea that our team has been exploring for some time. On
    a napkin at a conference in Florida, I sketched this idea out and described it
    to Wes Faler, the founder of Miles Space. He was quite clever in developing both
    the base thruster and the fusion enhancement.

    our already stellar thruster and make it fusion-enhanced with remarkable improvements
    in performance. Thanks to AFWERX and the USSF [United States Space Force] for
    believing it was possible!”

    an in-space demonstration scheduled for February 2025 as a hosted payload on space
    robotics firm Rogue Space System’s Barry-2 spacecraft. “We are very excited to
    test FireStar for RocketStar,” said Brent Abbott, CRO at Rogue Space Systems. 
    “We look forward to considering it for future Rogue missions.”
