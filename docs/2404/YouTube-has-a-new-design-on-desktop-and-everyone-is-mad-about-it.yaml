    especially if you’re looking for user-generated video content and not the latest
    Hollywood flick. However, it has made several questionable decisions in the content
    presentation department, including [marathon ad segments](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-30-second-unskippable-tv-ads/)
    before videos even begin and pushing mobile-first [Shorts content on suboptimal
    platforms](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-shorts-tv-launch/) like smart
    TVs. Its latest such decision is a complete overhaul of elements surrounding the
    video player on the YouTube player, and netizens are not happy.

    on the web, in the column of suggested videos to the right of the video player.
    Now, though, the entire video title, uploader info, and comments have shifted
    to the right, trading places with the video suggestions. YouTube has just shrunk
    all the pill-shaped buttons, text, and comments into the slender column on the
    right, while recommended videos and the Shorts shelf we just mentioned now have
    a prominent spot right under the player.

    descriptions are crammed in that tiny space. Switching to Theater mode in the
    player controls doesn’t save you either — it just shifts the video info and column
    of comments under the player, but still right-aligned with the recommendations
    taking up most of the screen real estate.

    divided. On the one hand, [some users appreciated](https://x.com/CherriFireLive/status/1778090193871917233)
    how you could read and engage with the comments while watching the video without
    scrolling down and hiding the video player. On the other hand, several users [found
    the change jarring](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1c0ayew/why_just_why/)
    and too dense, with a lot of [wasted screen space](https://x.com/chkdg8/status/1777935840766722367)
    on the sides.

- en: The new UI is quite like the [recent update](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-app-video-streaming-upgrade/)
    to the app for smart TVs, but we think the new design also represents an ideological
    shift at the company, prioritizing content engagement and user retention over
    community interactions through the comments. We reached out to YouTube for comment,
    and were informed the new layout is a limited test to make reading comments easier
    while watching videos on desktop.

  zh: 新的用户界面与智能电视应用程序的[最近更新](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-app-video-streaming-upgrade/)非常相似，但我们认为新设计也代表了公司的意识形态转变，优先考虑内容参与度和用户留存，而不是通过评论进行社区互动。我们联系了YouTube寻求评论，得知新布局是一个有限测试，旨在使在桌面观看视频时更容易阅读评论。

    and experiments reveals this is one of many layouts YouTube has dabbled with since
    February 20 this year. Thankfully, this is still a test and given the overwhelming
    feedback from users on Twitter, UI designers may need to go back to the drawing
    board with this one.
