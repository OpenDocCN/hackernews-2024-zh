- en: According to the latest draft text of the controversial [EU Child Sexual Abuse
    Regulation proposal](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-11-conseil-csam-compromis-9-avril.pdf)
    leaked by the French news organization Contexte, [which the EU member states discussed](https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVII/EU/179658/imfname_11360113.pdf),
    the EU interior ministers want to exempt professional accounts of staff of intelligence
    agencies, police and military from the envisaged scanning of chats and messages
    (Article 1 (2a)). The regulation should also not apply to “confidential information”
    such as professional secrets (Article 1 (2b)). The EU governments reject the idea
    that the new EU Child Protection Centre should support them in the prevention
    of child sexual abuse and develop best practices for prevention initiatives (Article
    43(8)).

    intelligence officers and even themselves from chat control scanning proves that
    they know exactly just how unreliable and dangerous the snooping algorithms are
    that they want to unleash on us citizens,” commented Pirate Party MEP Patrick
    Breyer. “They seem to fear that even military secrets without any link to child
    sexual abuse could end up in the US at any time. The confidentiality of government
    communications is certainly important, but the same must apply to the protection
    of business and of course citizens communications, including the spaces that victims
    of abuse themselves need for secure exchanges and therapy. We know that most of
    the chats leaked by today’s voluntary snooping algorithms are of no relevance
    to the police, for example family photos or consensual sexting. It is outrageous
    that the EU interior ministers themselves do not want to suffer the consequences
    of the destruction of digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption
    that they are imposing on us.”

    is a lie cast in paragraphs. No provider and no algorithm can know or determine
    whether a chat is being conducted with doctors, therapists, lawyers, defence lawyers,
    etc. so as to exempt it from chat control. Chat control inevitably threatens to
    leak intimate photos sent for medical purposes and trial documents sent for defending
    abuse victims.”

    ministers reject the development of best practices for preventing child sexual
    abuse. It couldn’t be clearer that the aim of this bill is China-style mass surveillance
    and not better protecting our children. Real child protection would require a
    systematic scientific evaluation and implementation of multidisciplinary prevention
    programmes, as well as Europe-wide standards and guidelines for criminal investigations
    into child abuse, including the identification of victims and the necessary technical
    means. None of this is planned by the EU interior ministers.”
