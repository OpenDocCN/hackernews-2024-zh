    Word, Excel, PowerPoint; Pages, Numbers, Keynote; Docs, Sheets, Slides. Now Google
    is [proposing to add another](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-generative-ai-and-security-innovations#:~:text=through%20video%20with-,Google%20Vids,-%2C%20a%20new%20AI)
    to that triumvirate: an app called Vids that aims to help companies and consumers
    make collaborative, shareable video more easily than ever.'

    movies. It’s meant more for the sorts of things people do at work: make a pitch,
    update the team, explain a complicated concept. The main goal is to make everything
    as easy as possible, says Kristina Behr, Google’s VP of product management for
    the Workspace collaboration apps. “The ethos that we have is, if you can make
    a slide, you can make a video in Vids,” she says. “No video production is required.”'

- en: Based on what I’ve seen of Vids so far, it appears to be roughly what you’d
    get if you transformed Google Slides into a video app. You collect assets from
    Drive and elsewhere and assemble them in order — but unlike the column of slides
    in the Slides sidebar, you’re putting together a left-to-right timeline for a
    video. Then, you can add voiceover or film yourself and edit it all into a finished
    video. A lot of those finished videos, I suspect, will look like recorded PowerPoint
    presentations or Meet calls or those now-ubiquitous training videos where a person
    talks to you from a small circle in the bottom corner while graphics play on the
    screen. There will be lots of clip art-heavy product promos, I’m sure. But in
    theory, you can make almost anything in Vids.

    to make a first draft of the video for you. Gemini can build a storyboard; it
    can write a script; it can read your script aloud with text-to-speech; it can
    create images for you to use in the video. The app has a library of stock video
    and audio that users can add to their own Vids, too.

    other productivity tools, when you share a Vid (that’s what Google wants you to
    call them), you’re not just sharing a file with a play button. People you share
    with can comment, leave notes, and even edit the video themselves. “You can export
    it to an MP4 if you wanted,” Behr says, “but what we hope is that it looks a lot
    like our other collaboration apps.” In her mind — and Google’s — a video isn’t
    that different from a spreadsheet.

    tools like Loom to editing suites like Descript. Companies like ClickUp are starting
    to bake video features right into their productivity suite, too. Even Vimeo has
    become in large part a business-focused tool for [making quick marketing videos](/2023/6/20/23766809/vimeo-ai-tools-script-generator-editing).
    Google’s actually late to this market, but it’s making the same bet as everyone
    else: that in an era of remote work and a culture dominated by video, employees
    are going to spend less of their 9-5 writing emails and more of it making videos.'

    its many other tools. There’s lots of that coming, Behr says, along with mobile
    support over time. One thing missing, though? Any sign of YouTube. You know, that
    other video service Google owns. Behr laughs when I mention it and says that there’s
    some tech shared between the products but that “the audience and use cases are
    pretty fundamentally different” between the two products. This is a work product,
    for workers, to use at work. “We’re trying to make sure we’re really supporting
    that use case, you know?”

- en: Google plans to launch Vids in a public beta this summer. Some Workspace customers
    have been testing it already, and Behr says she’s already seeing some trends emerge.
    Most Vids are short, she says — under three minutes. Most are things like pitches,
    training videos, updates, and videos celebrating accomplishments or people. Behr
    says she has replaced her weekly recap emails with Vids, “and I get a lot of feedback
    that people like it because they can see my facial expressions when I’m talking
    about things.”

- en: Vids could have been a feature in Slides or Docs. By breaking it out on its
    own, Google seems to want to signal that this is something more than just another
    way to present a deck; it’s an entirely new way to share information. I’m not
    sure you can [trust any Google product](/2024/4/2/24118873/google-podcasts-shutdown-graveyard)
    to stick around forever, but the Docs, Sheets, and Slides gang is as sticky as
    anything in tech. Google thinks Vids is just as big.
