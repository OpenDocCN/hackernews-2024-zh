    national residences as a way to hedge their financial risk, according to a leading
    law firm.

- en: The wealthy are building these "passport portfolios" — collections of second,
    and even third or fourth, citizenships — in case they need to flee their home
    country. Henley & Partners, a law firm that specializes in high-net-worth citizenships,
    said Americans now outnumber every other nationality when it comes to securing
    alternative residences or added citizenships.

- en: '"The U.S. is still a great country, it''s still an amazing passport," said
    Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners. "But if I''m
    wealthy, I would like to hedge against levels of volatility and uncertainty. The
    idea of diversification is well understood by wealthy individuals around what
    they invest. It makes no sense to have one country of citizenship and residence
    when I have the ability to actually diversify that aspect of my life as well."'

    investor Peter Thiel, who added a citizenship in New Zealand, and former Google
    CEO Eric Schmidt, who applied for citizenship in Cyprus.

    citizenship. While a relatively small number of Americans do renounce their citizenship
    every year to declare a new home country, mainly due to tax-filing requirements,
    the so-called "exit tax" required to renounce citizenship makes it financially
    prohibitive for most except the ultra-wealthy to simply renounce and declare a
    new citizenship.

    program to supplement their U.S. passport.

- en: According to Henley, the top destinations for supplemental passports among Americans
    are Portugal, Malta, Greece and Italy. Portugal's "Golden Visa" program is especially
    popular since it provides a path to residency and citizenship — with visa-free
    travel in Europe — in exchange for an investment of 500,000 euros (roughly $541,000)
    in a fund or private equity. Malta offers a Golden Visa for 300,000 euros invested
    in real estate, which Volek said has become "especially popular with Americans."

    across Europe," he said. "So you can live in Germany, your kids can go and study
    in France and you have the right to live, work and study throughout Europe."'

    "domicile diversification." An alternative passport makes travel easier for Americans
    venturing to parts of the world that are less friendly to the U.S.

- en: '"For American, British, and Israeli citizens suddenly unsure of their welcome
    abroad, supplementary passports provide vital flexibility," according to a Henley
    report. "With rising global instability, holding citizenship in another country,
    particularly one that is considered more neutral or politically benign, now provides
    a valuable back-up or alternative option."'

- en: Another reason is business travel, which can be safer and less conspicuous with
    a non-U.S. passport in many countries. U.S. business leaders could be targets
    for "resentment, hostage-taking, or random terrorism in the chaos of collapsed
    states or high-risk countries they need to travel to for business purposes," according
    to the report, which says interested parties range from hedge-fund managers who
    meet with global clients to mining company executives who visit operations sites.

    deals within the new country.

    retirement, to be closer to their families who live abroad or for lifestyle reasons
    in the new age of remote work. For others, U.S. politics is the driver.

    government crackdowns on wealth, and political uncertainty drive more wealthy
    residents to other countries. An estimated 128,000 millionaires are forecast to
    move to a new country this year, up from 120,000 in 2023 and up from 51,000 in
    2013, according to Henley.
