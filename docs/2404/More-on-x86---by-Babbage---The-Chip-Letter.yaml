- en: That said, on the measure, I would disagree that x86 “needs to die”. The reason
    I say that is because x86 (now x64) has done a remarkable job stabilizing software
    development over the past forty years. Sure, you can call that “legacy” or a “maintenance
    problem” if you want to look at the downsides. But you could also call it a *remarkably
    flexible instruction set* if you’d like to look at the upsides.

    could have been introduced a decade ago - are appearing only when x86 faces a
    lot more competition. If we needed a demonstration of the problems of the x86
    ‘lock-in’ then this is it.

- en: In any event, I think calling, as some do, x86 a ‘legacy’ architecture is premature.
    Intel and AMD have proven that it can remain competitive and it will become more
    so with APX. As we’ve discussed before, x86 will be around for a long time - many
    decades at least - and will continue to be built at scale on leading-edge fabrication
    processes. It just won't be as dominant as it has been for the last couple of
    decades and that is surely healthy.

    manufacturing. Even before that though, AMD has often proven to be a nimble and

    - as AMD64 - whilst Intel pursued Itanium.
