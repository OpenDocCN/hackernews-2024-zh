- en: That said, on the measure, I would disagree that x86 “needs to die”. The reason
    I say that is because x86 (now x64) has done a remarkable job stabilizing software
    development over the past forty years. Sure, you can call that “legacy” or a “maintenance
    problem” if you want to look at the downsides. But you could also call it a *remarkably
    flexible instruction set* if you’d like to look at the upsides.

    Intel x86-64 cores appeared in 2004\. When will the first APX cores appear? As
    far as I can tell Intel hasn’t told us yet, which must mean that it is 2025 at
    the earliest.

- en: I don’t think it’s any coincidence that these improvements - which probably
    could have been introduced a decade ago - are appearing only when x86 faces a
    lot more competition. If we needed a demonstration of the problems of the x86
    ‘lock-in’ then this is it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any event, I think calling, as some do, x86 a ‘legacy’ architecture is premature.
    Intel and AMD have proven that it can remain competitive and it will become more
    so with APX. As we’ve discussed before, x86 will be around for a long time - many
    decades at least - and will continue to be built at scale on leading-edge fabrication
    processes. It just won't be as dominant as it has been for the last couple of
    decades and that is surely healthy.

    the time of writing on 22/4/24) has been made possible by access to TSMC’s superior
    manufacturing. Even before that though, AMD has often proven to be a nimble and
    innovative competitor. The 64-bit version of x86 was, of course, an AMD creation
    - as AMD64 - whilst Intel pursued Itanium.
