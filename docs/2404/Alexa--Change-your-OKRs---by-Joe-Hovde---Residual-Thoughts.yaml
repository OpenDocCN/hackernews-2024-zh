- en: An email I recently got from Alexa. I expect I am one of a very small number
    of people who read it.

- en: I still have an Amazon Alexa, which I find somewhat embarrassing to admit. But
    it was cheap and functional and I like to be able to play music with my voice
    or set an alarm without looking at a screen. I even occasionally use it to reorder
    things from Amazon, which as far as I can tell is the only way they make any money
    from it.

- en: I am close to getting rid of it, though, because it constantly tries to upsell
    me to use “routines.” For example, I will ask “Alexa, what’s the weather?” and
    it will respond, in its hauntingly monotonic female robot voice, “It’s 45 degrees
    right now. **By the way, I can tell you the weather and the news, and turn on
    your lights every morning when you wake up. Would you like me to do that?**”

    the way, you can play a trivia game while you wait. Would you like to do that?**”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, I just say “No,” but sometimes I will say “No, and never ask me anything
    like that ever again.” When I say that, the robot is silent, but I know it is
    only a temporary respite. The next time I ask it a question, it will glibly offer
    me another supposedly helpful add-on.

- en: I am certain that the team working on Alexa at Amazon has an OKR centered on
    something like **“*****increasing the percentage of Alexa users who use scheduled
    routines or proprietary apps.*****”** If you don’t know the term OKR, consider
    yourself lucky and don’t look it up; for our purposes you can just think of it
    as a “corporate goal.”

- en: The team came up with this goal because it makes sense that they would want
    people to use their thing a lot. The more people use their thing, the more “value”
    it imparts to them and the more bonded to Amazon they become. It theoretically
    increases the lifetime value of the user (me) to use their thing more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The trouble with this is that while all of it makes sense, it fails to capture
    the animosity built up by being pushy with features through a medium as intimate
    as voice in a user’s home. Sure, they probably have “guardrail metrics” like user
    retention or daily active users to ensure that there is no obvious downside to
    promoting these features, but these are blunt instruments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps they are measuring the number of users that churn from Alexa entirely,
    or some version of a Net Promoter Score in an email survey that they run. But
    it is very hard to attribute a user leaving a product to one specific change.
    So, I expect they’ve run tests that show that adding a given upsell doesn’t negatively
    impact user retention over some period, say 3 months. But it’s difficult to measure
    the impact of layering lots of these little annoyances on top of each other, and
    each subteam within the Alexa org is incentivized to promote their own little
    feature (after all, they have to hit their OKRs!). So the experience gets more
    and more bloated with upsells, until one day the user is so fed up he throws the
    Alexa out of his window, and it hits an innocent bystander, and they die a death
    that could have been avoided with a more thoughtful management structure.

- en: I think Alexa would be a much better product if it had a person at the top who
    used the product a lot and could make decisions on behalf of the user. These decisions
    would be informed by the data I mentioned above but they would not be captured
    by the data; they would have a common sense, “let’s not make our users miserable”
    motivation. The extreme version of this is someone like Steve Jobs, who ruled
    by decree and intuition, making decisions himself instead of relying on incentive
    structures to produce the right outcomes.

- en: The trouble with this setup is it requires the organization to place trust in
    human taste and judgment, and it requires that it lets go of the satisfying feeling
    of being a master watchmaker and building an OKR machine where every team produces
    something measurable and they all ladder up to the organization’s goals to create
    the perfect product. Especially in products where a lot of the value comes from
    the *feeling you get when you use the product* (like a speaker you talk to inside
    your home), I don’t think it is possible to build the perfect system with measurable
    goals and incentives, because the feeling of beautiful design or terrible design
    will not be measurable.

- en: This is in contrast to Amazon’s core shopping experience, where most of the
    value comes from the utility of being able to find anything you want to buy and
    get it delivered quickly. The feeling you get when you look at the cluttered homepage
    is not a great one, but that’s okay, because it accomplishes what you need to
    get done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A product team must decide where on the spectrum of “delightful experience”
    to “pure utility” its product belongs, and the further towards the delightful
    experience it is, the more it must be designed with human taste and the harder
    it will be to build an OKR machine that outputs it.
