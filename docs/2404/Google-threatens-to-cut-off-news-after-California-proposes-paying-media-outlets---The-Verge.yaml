- en: Google says it will start removing links to California news websites in a “short
    term test for a small percentage of California users.” The move is in response
    to the pending California Journalism Preservation Act (CJPA), which would require
    Google to pay a fee for linking Californians to news articles.

    Californians and the traffic we can provide to California publishers,” Jaffer
    Zaidi, Google VP of global news partnerships, [wrote in a blog post](https://blog.google/products/news/california-journalism-preservation-act-puts-news-ecosystem-at-risk/)
    announcing the decision. “The testing process involves removing links to California
    news websites, potentially covered by CJPA, to measure the impact of the legislation
    on our product experience.”

    news ecosystem,” referring to initiatives like [Google News Showcase](https://news.google.com/news-showcase/),
    product and licensing programs for news organizations, and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/).

    (as well as Meta) receives a much larger cut of online advertising than publishers.
    An [Electronic Frontier Foundation report](https://www.eff.org/files/2023/06/14/saving_the_news_from_big_tech_eff.pdf)
    notes that half of every ad dollar gets eaten up by fees, while subscriptions
    are subject to app store taxes.

    sharing more equitable. Google alleges that it already drives traffic to publishers
    and that this sort of legislation favors media conglomerates at the risk of further
    hollowing out local papers.

    makes from news. Technically, it doesn’t host ads on Google News, but media companies
    argue that linking out to news content benefits the platform more broadly. A [2023
    study](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24129986/paying-for-news.pdf) estimates
    that Google would owe US publishers around $10 to 12 billion annually should the
    [Journalism Competition and Preservation Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/673)
    — a national bill — come into effect.

    to force it to pay media outlets for news. In 2014, it [pulled out of Spain](/2014/12/11/7375733/google-news-spain-shutdown)
    after a similar measure was passed but eventually returned [after an eight-year
    absence](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-news-re-opens-spain-after-eight-year-shutdown-2022-06-22/)

    Ultimately, Google caved and cut a deal with several Australian publishers — and
