    science. There have been many passionate discussions about this complex scientific
    domain. To this day, we still do not have full understanding of how human vision
    works, so we are excited about the future.

- en: What is the future of **Colour**? We thought we could merge the GPU backend
    four years ago and ultimately decided against. The main issue is that it was very
    much vendor locked because of [Cupy](https://cupy.dev). In a hindsight, this was
    a good decision as there has been some exciting new development with the [Python
    Array API Standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html). We haven't
    started work yet to support it, but we have certainly [discussed about it](https://github.com/colour-science/colour/issues/1244).

- en: We also thought that 1.0.0 would be released, but this did not happened! We
    instead continued to improve the API and a stable release will only be possible
    after adoption of the Python Array API standard.
