    Friday from the [Kansas Reflector](https://kansasreflector.com/2024/04/04/when-facebook-fails-local-media-matters-even-more-for-our-planets-future/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=we-can-slay-giants)
    that was critical of Facebook’s ad policy on climate change and the link to which
    was blocked across Meta platforms on Thursday.

    (Meta’s version of Twitter), it was taken down and flagged as a violation of community
    standards on cybersecurity. Shortly thereafter, *all* links to my site were blocked
    on *all* Meta platforms, and anyone who’d ever posted a story of mine received
    an alert that the link had been taken down due to that same cybersecurity violation.
    The same thing happened to the *Reflector* the day before, [as I reported](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/facebook-kansas-reflector-links-banned).

    from posting, I discovered I could no longer post to Threads. I was, albeit it
    just for an hour, prevented from participating in a conversation that directly
    impacted my work and reputation. As someone who has used social media to amplify
    my voice and work for my entire adult life, it was an eery feeling. A bit Black
    Mirror-y for my taste.

    with Sherman Smith, Editor-in-Chief of the *Reflector*, Stone, “wouldn’t elaborate
    on how the mistake happened and said there would be no further explanation.” Smith
    told me that when he asked Stone if the company planned to issue a follow-up alert
    to all the Facebook users who’d been told our links were flagged as malicious,
    Stone said no. He did, however, encourage Smith to write about it.

    did if not for [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=we-can-slay-giants).
    It’s a tiny social platform compared to its predecessors, but it’s mighty. It’s
    because of the premium the community there places on a free press that they amplified
    the Meta blackout enough to get national news coverage. They sent me screenshots
    of what was happening when they tried to post my work to Meta platforms, and stayed
    engaged throughout the day as the baffling situation continued to unfold.

    The *Reflector* was able to post the column critical of Facebook’s ad policy because
    they don’t answer to corporate overlords. They fearlessly cover local Kansas government
    and politics day in and day out, and are an indispensable resource when so many
    local news outlets have been bought up and corrupted by larger entities. And as
    we saw with the police raid on the [Marion County Record](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/a-conversation-with-the-newspaper)
    last summer, tech companies aren’t the only ones intent on silencing local outlets.'

    to repost the *Reflector* column while I was in the shower (during the freak New
    York-area earthquake, no less) and because I only have my subscribers to answer
    to, I was able to go right ahead and do it. No red tape—only the limits of my
    ability to copy edit myself.

    I’ve grown accustomed to taking big swings. It’s isolating and often alienates
    me from folks uncomfortable with this type of journalism, but I’ve realized that
    after building a platform for myself over the past decade, I sure as hell am going

    to do better. Yet we continue to see that that’s simply not the case.
