- en: House lawmakers voted on Friday to reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence
    [Surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance) Act, or Fisa, including
    a key measure that allows for warrantless surveillance of Americans. The controversial
    law allows for far-reaching monitoring of foreign communications, but has also
    led to the collection of US citizens’ messages and phone calls.

    for years backed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/28/biden-administration-warrantless-surveillance-law-section-702)
    as an important counterterrorism tool. An amendment that would have required authorities
    seek a warrant failed, in a tied 212-212 vote across party lines.

- en: The law, which gives the government expansive powers to view emails, calls and
    texts, has long been divisive and resulted in allegations from civil liberties
    groups that it violates privacy rights. House Republicans were split in the lead-up
    to vote over whether to reauthorize section 702, the most contentious aspect of
    the bill, with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, struggling to unify them around
    a revised version of the pre-existing law.

- en: Republicans shot down a procedural vote on Wednesday that would have allowed
    Johnson to put the bill to a floor vote, in a further blow to the speaker’s ability
    to find compromise within his party. Following the defeat, the bill was changed
    from a five-year extension to a two-year extension of section 702 – an effort
    to appease far-right Republicans who believe Trump will be president by the time
    it expires.

- en: Section 702 allows for government agencies such as the National Security Administration
    to collect data and monitor the communications of foreign citizens outside of
    US territory without the need for a warrant, with authorities touting it as a
    key tool in targeting cybercrime, international drug trafficking and terrorist
    plots. Since the collection of foreign data can also gather communications between
    people abroad and those in the US, however, the result of section 702 is that
    federal law enforcement can also monitor American citizens’ communications.

    the past year after court documents revealed that [the FBI had improperly used
    it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/19/fbi-digital-surveillance-misuse-jan6-blm/)
    almost 300,000 times – targeting racial justice protesters, January 6 suspects
    and others. That overreach emboldened resistance to the law, especially among
    far-right Republicans who view intelligence services like the FBI as their opponent.

    appeared to refer to an FBI investigation into a former campaign adviser of his,

    Gaetz similarly vowed to derail the legislation, putting its passage in peril.

- en: Debate over Section 702 pitted Republicans who alleged that the law was a tool
    for spying on American citizens against others in the GOP who sided with intelligence
    officials and deemed it a necessary measure to stop foreign terrorist groups.
    One proposed amendment called for requiring authorities to secure a warrant before
    using section 702 to view US citizens’ communications, an idea that intelligence
    officials oppose as limiting their ability to act quickly. Another [sticking point](https://rollcall.com/2024/04/09/house-again-tees-up-reauthorization-of-powerful-spy-authority/)
    in the debate was whether law enforcement should be prohibited from buying information
    on American citizens from data broker firms, which amass and sell personal data
    on tens of millions of people, including phone numbers and email addresses.

- en: Section 702 dates back to the George W Bush administration, which secretly ran
    warrantless wiretapping and surveillance programs in the aftermath of the 9/11
    terror attacks. In 2008, Congress passed section 702 as part of the Fisa Amendments
    Act and put foreign surveillance under more formal government oversight. Lawmakers
    have renewed the law twice since, including in 2018 when they [rejected an amendment](https://www.wired.com/story/fisa-section-702-renewal-congress/)
    that would have required authorities to get warrants for US citizens’ data.

    to congressional leaders telling them to reauthorize section 702\. They claimed
    that intelligence gained from it resulted in numerous plots against the US being
    foiled, and that it was partly responsible for facilitating the drone strike that
    killed the al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in 2022.
