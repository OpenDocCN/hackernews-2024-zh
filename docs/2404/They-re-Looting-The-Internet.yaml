    the large language models (LLMs) underpinning the generative AI boom require incredible
    amounts of data. As a result, every single LLM-based application  — ChatGPT, Google
    Gemini, Anthropic''s Claude, Meta''s LLaMA, to name but a few — is trained on
    an indeterminately-large portion of the internet made up of both Common Crawl
    ([a 250-billion page repository of web content](https://commoncrawl.org/?ref=wheresyoured.at))
    and what appears to be as much of the rest of the internet as they''re able to
    download, legally or otherwise. After profiting handsomely from being the middleman
    between content creation and internet users, big tech is in the process of looting
    the internet as a means of training models that it hopes can replace human beings
    themselves. And I''m not being remotely dramatic.'

    recently, LLMs are running out of training data, and the desperation to find more
    will lead to significant legal consequences when it's revealed exactly how much
    they stole and from whom they stole it from. As these generative AI companies
    become *more* desperate, they'll (intentionally or otherwise) ingest AI-generated
    content, which causes a degenerative training effect called "model collapse" (also
    known as Habsburg AI) that destroys the model's ability to deliver useful answers.
    By all accounts, this is already happening, with [Adobe's Firefly AI accidentally
