    of scientific literature, identifying research questions, assisting in data processing,
    and predicting innovative drug compounds. But these can't replace experts, at
    least not yet.

    scientists will remain important in the foreseeable future, and the scale and
    complexity of research projects will continue to grow," they state in their paper.
    "As such, we complement the focus on AI as a worker to explore AI as a ''manager''
    of humans who perform research tasks."'

    200 hundred research projects to see how they handled five managerial challenges
    – task division and task allocation, direction, coordination, motivation, and
    supporting learning.

    (i.e., messages) to increase user motivation," the paper explains. "The AI balances
    the trade-off between messages sent too early (disrupting the workflow and addressing
    a problem that was not acute yet) versus messages sent too late."'

- en: Based on a comparison with projects that don't rely on managerial AI, the authors
    claim that those using mecha-management tend to be larger and tend to be associated
    with platforms, due to the benefit of shared technology infrastructure. This,
    they say, has implications in terms of platform dominance and how large research
    organizations like universities should approach research funding and IT infrastructure.

    needs to be done, noting that scientific work differs from gig work and office
    work, where studies on the impact of algorithmic intervention have already been

    algorithmic management may reduce autonomy if AI monitors researchers individually

    from motivational mechanisms and worker control over data about their skills,
    motivation, and performance – eg, what if organizations shared worker metrics
    data from AI management systems and that influenced future hiring decisions involving
    said workers.
