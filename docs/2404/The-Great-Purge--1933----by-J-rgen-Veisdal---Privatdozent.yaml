    one hundred and fifty years. Its reputation for excellence in chemistry, physics,
    biology, medicine and mathematics was rivaled, if at all, only by Britan (Medawar
    & Pyke, 2000). Of the 100 Nobel Prizes awarded between the years of 1901 and 1932
    (the year before Hitler came to power), 33 had been awarded to Germans and/or
    scientists working in Germany. For comparison, Brits and scientists in British
    universities had won 18 and the United States a mere six.

    and their passing of the *Berufsbeamtengesetz* (“Law for the Restoration of the

    from German universities. That is, civil servants who did not fit the Nazi racial
    or societal ideal had to leave their jobs in the name of *“re-establishing a national
    and professional civil service”.* In addition to bureaucrats, teachers, judges
    and other workers, scientists and academics were almost immediately affected,
    including at the world-leading institutions of the University of Göttingen and
    Humboldt University of Berlin (Heims, 1980 p. 165). By the middle of April, the

    writes in his letter to Veblen, mathematician Richard Courant (1888–1972), one
    of Göttingen’s three institute heads. He left Germany for Cambridge in 1933, as
    he was dismissed from his position, not for being Jewish (exempted a veteran of
    the First World War), but due to his membership in the social-democratic political
    left (Schappacher, 1991). A former student of [David Hilbert](https://www.privatdozent.co/t/hilbert)
    (1862-1943), Courant first accepted a position in Cambridge, but grew homesick
    within a year and returned to Germany, only to realize that there was no way for
    him to stay permanently. He thus re-emigrated, this time to New York University
    where he would remain for the rest of his life, building up a large and flourishing
    mathematics department (Medawar & Pyke, 2000) there. Other students of Hilbert
    at Göttingen, including Felix Bernstein (1878–1956) and Edmund Landau (1877–1938)
    were also forced out, as was Hilbert’s student [Hermann Weyl](https://www.privatdozent.co/t/weyl)

    been offered von Neumann’s position at the Institute for Advanced Study, Weyl

    Following his *habilitation* in 1929 under Born, he remained at the University
    of Göttingen as a *privatdozent* until 1933, when he was let go. Safely in the

    University of Bristol, working under Nevill F. Mott. London, also a physicist,
    similarly lost his position at the University of Berlin following the enactment

    Hahn (1879–1968), despite supposed Jewish ancestry (Riehl & Seitz, 1996), too
    remained in Germany during the rise of the Nazis, discovering nuclear fission
    in 1938 and being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944\. An opponent of
