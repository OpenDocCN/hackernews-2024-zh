    for months, awake, able to walk and read the newspaper. But he might never leave
    the I.C.U. “It’s a trap,” Zitter said. *ECMO* is transforming medical care, saving

- en: The beginnings of *ECMO* date back to 1931, when a surgical resident in Boston
    named John Gibbon cared for a woman with a pulmonary embolism—a blocked artery
    in the lungs, which made it harder for her blood to receive oxygen and ferry it
    to the rest of her body. Gibbon had no treatment, and could only watch her decline
    and die. “During that long night . . . the idea naturally occurred to me that
    if it were possible to remove continuously some of the blue blood . . . put oxygen
    into that blood . . . and then to inject continuously the now-red blood back into
    the patient’s arteries, we might have saved her life,” Gibbon later wrote. “We
    would have bypassed the obstructing embolus and performed part of the work of
    the patient’s heart and lungs outside the body.” The woman was gone by morning,
    but Gibbon set to work. By 1934, he had developed a machine that could support
    the circulation of a cat for thirty minutes. In 1952, it was finally ready for
    humans. Gibbon used the machine to replace the heart and lungs of a college student
    while he operated on her heart, repairing a cardiac defect. She survived; this
    event marked the advent of modern open-heart surgery.

  zh: '*ECMO* 的起源可以追溯到1931年，当时波士顿的一名外科住院医生 John Gibbon 照顾一名患肺栓塞的女性——肺部动脉阻塞，使她的血液更难接收氧气并将其输送到身体其他部位。Gibbon
    没有有效治疗方法，只能眼睁睁看着她恶化并最终死去。“在那漫长的夜晚中 . . . 我自然想到，如果能够不断地移除一些静脉血 . . . 将氧气注入血液 . . .
    然后不断地将现在的红色血液重新注入病人的动脉中，也许能够挽救她的生命，” Gibbon 后来写道。“我们将会绕过那个阻塞的栓子，并在体外执行病人心脏和肺部的部分工作。”
    次日清晨，女性已去世，但 Gibbon 开始着手研究。到了1934年，他已经开发出一台能够支持猫咪循环30分钟的机器。1952年，它终于准备好用于人类。Gibbon
    在为一名心脏有缺陷的大学生修复心脏缺陷时使用了这台机器来替代心脏和肺部功能。她存活了下来；这一事件标志着现代开放性心脏手术的开始。'
- en: Gibbon’s bypass circuit soon became an integral part of cardiothoracic surgery.
    But the technology relied on the direct mixing of oxygen and blood—a process that
    rendered the blood toxic after about an hour. Gibbon’s system left too much oxygen
    floating free in the bloodstream. In 1965, Robert Bartlett, another surgical resident
    in Boston, set out to solve this problem. Bartlett built a “membrane oxygenator”
    out of silicone, which mitigated oxygen’s noxious effects by allowing it to diffuse
    slowly into the blood across a semipermeable membrane, essentially in the same
    manner that it travels across the thin walls of the alveoli in our lungs. This
    gave the hemoglobin in the patient’s bloodstream time to absorb the oxygen. Within
    three years, his devices were keeping animals alive through “extracorporeal circulation”
    for up to four days. In 1971, his colleagues used a similar setup to support a
    man with respiratory failure. He lived on the machine for thirty-six hours, becoming
    the first human survivor of *ECMO*.

  zh: Gibbon 的旁路循环很快成为心胸外科的一个重要组成部分。但这项技术依赖于氧气和血液的直接混合，这一过程使血液在大约一小时后变得有毒。Gibbon 的系统使过多的氧气悬浮在血流中。1965年，波士顿的另一名外科住院医生
    Robert Bartlett 开始解决这个问题。Bartlett 制造了一个由硅胶构成的“膜式氧合器”，通过半透膜缓慢让氧气扩散到血液中，从根本上减少了氧气的有害影响，这与它在我们肺泡薄壁中的传输方式相同。这使得病人血液中的血红蛋白有时间吸收氧气。在三年内，他的装置使动物通过“体外循环”活了多达四天。1971年，他的同事们使用类似的装置支持一名呼吸衰竭的男子。他在机器上生存了三十六小时，成为第一位*ECMO*的人类幸存者。
- en: 'In 1975, Bartlett and his associates used their device to sustain a newborn
    who developed respiratory failure after birth. Within fifteen years, hundreds
    of babies with similar problems had been saved with *ECMO*, with a survival rate
    of eighty per cent. The technology became standard in the largest pediatric centers.
    But a trial with adult patients, in 1979, found a mortality rate of ninety per
    cent: it seemed that using *ECMO* in adults turned out to be far more difficult,
    because they often have multiple medical problems, and their illnesses are more
    complex. The adoption of *ECMO* for adult patients largely stalled, until H1N1
    influenza emerged in the Southern Hemisphere, in 2008\. “The Australians were
    reporting that they were having an epidemic, and the only thing that was improving
    outcomes was *ECMO*,” Bartlett told me. The technology had advanced, and doctors
    were better at using it; the machines now kept patients alive while their bodies
    fought the infection. A 2009 trial found that *ECMO* helped with respiratory failure
    from other causes. The number of hospitals offering *ECMO* increased threefold
    within ten years. And then the coronavirus pandemic arrived.'

    Bartlett告诉我。技术已经进步，医生们在使用它方面更加娴熟；现在的机器能够在患者的身体抵抗感染时维持其生命。2009年的一项试验发现*ECMO*有助于处理其他原因引起的呼吸衰竭。十年内，提供*ECMO*的医院数量增加了两倍。然后新冠疫情来临了。

    come home,” Garza told his wife, but he went anyway. A month later, he was still
    in the hospital, and his lungs were getting worse. He was wary of intubation—he’d
    heard that many patients didn’t survive for long after they’d been put on ventilators—and
    a nurse told him about *ECMO*, which would let his lungs heal by sparing them
    the work of breathing while inflamed by a viral infection. Michele recalled that
    *ECMO* was presented as “either a bridge to healing or a bridge to transplant.”

    *COVID* patients was as high as sixty per cent. In the spring of 2020, physicians
    at N.Y.U. treated thirty ventilated *COVID* patients with *ECMO*. Ninety per cent
    survived. Later that year, a study, published by *The Lancet*, of more than a
    thousand *COVID* patients treated with *ECMO* found a sixty-per-cent survival
    rate. In 2022, at Vanderbilt University, physicians studied a group of ventilated

    a ventilator first. His team found that, although the average survival rate for
    ventilated patients with *ECMO* was around fifty per cent, it was seventy-five
    per cent among the *ECMO*-first patients. DellaVolpe speculated that one reason
    the *ECMO*-first patients had more positive outcomes was that they could be awake.
    Since *ECMO* doesn’t require sedation, as ventilators do, he could get them out
    of bed to work with physical therapists. “As I read the tea leaves, I think this
    is going to be a big part of the I.C.U.,” DellaVolpe told me. In theory, *ECMO*
    could largely replace the use of ventilators for respiratory failure. Today, I.C.U.s

    minutes of CPR before they make it to *ECMO*. “As an E.R. doc yourself, you know

    “If you were to triple survival with a cancer drug, people wouldn’t believe it,”

    we have tripled survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In medicine, tripling
    survival is unheard of!” He told me about one patient who received CPR for three
    hours, and was taken to two different hospitals, before Marinaro’s team put him
    on *ECMO*. “That guy walked out of the hospital,” he said. Recently, he treated
    a sixteen-year-old girl named Sophia who collapsed in cardiac arrest in a Starbucks
    bathroom. She received CPR for an hour and nine minutes. “They were about to quit,”

    Marinaro’s own protocols recommend against deploying *ECMO* after more than an
    hour of CPR, because neurologic recovery becomes very unlikely. But then a paramedic
    said he had seen her move. Sophia had exhibited something called CPR-induced consciousness;
    the chest compressions were circulating enough blood for her to move an arm. Marinaro
    made an exception and put Sophia on *ECMO*. Later, in the I.C.U., someone whispered
