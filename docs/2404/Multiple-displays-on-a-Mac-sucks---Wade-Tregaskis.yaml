    use a bottom Dock, which is the worst place to have the Dock because so much stuff
    is placed right at the bottom of the screen – window resize widgets, toolbars
    & their buttons, horizontal scrollbars, etc. It’s immensely irritating to have
    to finesse minute mouse movements in order to avoid triggering the Dock while
    somehow still getting the cursor within a few pixels of the edge of the screen.
    Sometimes it’s necessary to move the entire window just to interact with its bottom
    parts – which can in turn require first resizing it from the top, in order to
    allow it to be moved upwards.

    is not a burden in itself – flicking the mouse to the top of the screen is a completely
    trivial operation.
  id: totrans-split-34

    the menubar will only deign to reveal itself on the “active” display, which is

    to Apple’s long-running war against clarity).
  id: totrans-split-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    top of the display in order to see the menubar. Worse, since macOS has some design
    flaws regarding menu bar reveal (e.g. it refuses to reveal if the frontmost application’s
    main thread runloop isn’t idle, and whenever an application is launching), you
    can’t immediately tell if it’s refusing to reveal itself because the cursor’s
    on the “wrong” display. So inevitably there’s wasted, distracting moments of pause
    and investigation, and possibly movement to a whole different display. For an
    operation that happens hundreds of times a day, wasted seconds add up.

    Xcode project into just half a 5k display, and having to constantly toggle between
    code & documentation is irritating and a little disruptive – there’s often a *lot*
    of rapid back-and-forth between code & docs, which is of course much easier if
