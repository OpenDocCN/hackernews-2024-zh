    to that side. Having to move the mouse across *multiple* displays just to get
    to the Dock is untenably slow and awkward.
  prefs: []

    I have to be careful about mouse movements near its edge of the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I prefer having the Dock on the left-hand side because it’s the least intrusive
    place – there’s relatively little you have to mouse to or interact with on the
    left edge (the right side is second-best, but notably is the home of scrollbars).
    It’s also slightly easier to mouse left (or right) than down, because moving the
    mouse ‘down’ (towards me) has extra tension from the USB cable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With multiple monitors (in a typical horizontal arrangement), I’m forced to
    use a bottom Dock, which is the worst place to have the Dock because so much stuff
    is placed right at the bottom of the screen – window resize widgets, toolbars
    & their buttons, horizontal scrollbars, etc. It’s immensely irritating to have
    to finesse minute mouse movements in order to avoid triggering the Dock while
    somehow still getting the cursor within a few pixels of the edge of the screen.
    Sometimes it’s necessary to move the entire window just to interact with its bottom
    parts – which can in turn require first resizing it from the top, in order to
    allow it to be moved upwards.

    and to save a little screen space, but also because the menubar ruined my previous
    iMac’s display by burning in, hard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also use the menubar a lot more than for just activating menus with the mouse
    – I have iStat Menus and a host of other monitoring utilities in there as well.
    So I’m frequently mousing up to the top of the screen to reveal the menubar. Which
    is not a burden in itself – flicking the mouse to the top of the screen is a completely
    trivial operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But it doesn’t work half the time, when you have multiple displays, because
    the menubar will only deign to reveal itself on the “active” display, which is
    often at a glance visually indistinguishable from the “inactive” display (thanks
    to Apple’s long-running war against clarity).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That defeats the instinct and muscle-memory to just flick the cursor to the
    top of the display in order to see the menubar. Worse, since macOS has some design
    flaws regarding menu bar reveal (e.g. it refuses to reveal if the frontmost application’s
    main thread runloop isn’t idle, and whenever an application is launching), you
    can’t immediately tell if it’s refusing to reveal itself because the cursor’s
    on the “wrong” display. So inevitably there’s wasted, distracting moments of pause
    and investigation, and possibly movement to a whole different display. For an
    operation that happens hundreds of times a day, wasted seconds add up.

    in placement, you end up with one to your left and one to your right, with a very
    irritating gap between them in the one place it’s natural to look – straight ahead
    of you. Neither display is aligned with the keyboard or mouse, which I find impairs
    typing and mousing accuracy (especially with a treadmill desk where I’m constantly
    moving). And I find I get a sore neck no matter what, because I’m spending all
    my time looking anywhere but centre.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    two windows side-by-side on one display, and two windows on separate displays
    (*especially* if the displays aren’t identical, or aren’t aligned on horizontal
    or vertical axes). Maybe it’s as a simple as the difference between moving your
    eyes and moving your head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever it is, I just cannot get comfortable moving between displays frequently.
    That then forces me to not put anything *important* on the second display (especially
    if it has an ergonomically inferior position compared to the primary display),
    so it ends up being kind of a dumping ground for stuff I don’t actually use that
    often – e.g. calendar, clipboard viewers, calculators, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And since I don’t actually use them that often, there’s really not much advantage
    to having them on a second display, versus just bringing them to the front on
    the main display and then hiding them again when I’m done. In fact, sometimes
    it’s counter-productive as irrelevant animations on the second display distract
    me, whereas they’d be safely out of sight behind other windows on the main display.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only meaningful use-case I have so far for genuine simultaneous use is moving
    information references – e.g. Xcode’s documentation window – to the second display.
    In fact that was the specific use-case that made me go to the trouble of hooking
    up the second display, since it’s practically impossible to fit a non-trivial
    Xcode project into just half a 5k display, and having to constantly toggle between
    code & documentation is irritating and a little disruptive – there’s often a *lot*
    of rapid back-and-forth between code & docs, which is of course much easier if
    they’re simultaneously visible.
