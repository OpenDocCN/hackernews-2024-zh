    with AI](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/xcwdn), has demonstrated that AI is
    surprisingly effective in countering conspiracy beliefs. It was demonstrated to
    be effective even against the true believers, individuals normally considered
    unwavering in their beliefs due to their connection of beliefs to their perceived
    identity.
