    surprisingly effective in countering conspiracy beliefs. It was demonstrated to
    be effective even against the true believers, individuals normally considered

    created here at Mind Prison. I typically spend hours to days on articles, including
    creating the illustrations for each. I hope if you find them valuable and you
    still appreciate the creations from the organic hardware within someone’s head,
    that you will consider subscribing. Thank you!
