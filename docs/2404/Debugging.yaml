    bugs. Debugging, particularly debugging of other people's code, is a skill separate
    from the ability to write programs in the first place. Unfortunately, while debugging
    is often practiced, it is rarely taught. A typical course in debugging techniques
    consists merely of reading the manual for a debugger.

    Don't simply rely on testers or users. If you notice something odd while running
    a program, it can be tempting to disregard it and hope that it will go away. This
    is especially true if you are working on something else at the time. Resist the
    temptation. Record the bug. If you have data files or logs, save them. If you
    have time later, return to the issue; otherwise, pass it on to somebody else.
    As one of the people most familiar with how the program is supposed to work, you
    are in the best possible position for detecting unexpected behaviour.

    it. This is of particular importance when working with a bug report produced by
    somebody else, such as the testing team or a user. Some bugs are relatively obvious,

    generates output which is slightly incorrect.

    something went wrong." Before doing anything else, you must find out what went

    what went wrong is generally wasted time.

    determine that it is not a bug at all. If there is a formal specification for
    the program, you may have to modify the specification. In other cases, you may
    have to modify the expectations of the user. This rapid fix is often known as
    declaring the behaviour to be an "undocumented feature." Despite the obvious potential
    for abuse, this is in fact sometimes the correct way to handle the problem.

    other cases, replication can be very difficult. It may require a lengthy series
    of steps, or, in an interactive program such as a game, it may require precise
    timing. In the worst cases, replication may be nearly impossible.

    from the bug report to the fix. However, failing to replicate the bug means that
    it is impossible to verify the fix. The fix may turn out to be for a different
    bug, or it may have no significant effect at all. If the bug has not been replicated,
    there is no way to tell.

    In a complex program, it's often quite easy to find something to fix--perhaps
    a real problem, perhaps merely something which looks like a problem. It's human
    nature to assume that any particular fix solves the problem at hand. Without a
    means of verification, any plausible fix will be accepted, whether it is right
    or wrong. An incorrect fix leads to future problems. On average, skipping the
    replication step wastes more time than it saves.

    control, with a copy of the program you built yourself. Replicating the bug on
    your own system means that you can easily test a patched version of the program.
    Unfortunately, in some cases this is impossible.

    reporting the bug may have a unique system configuration, or the user may be using
    private input files which you can not obtain. In these cases you must try to ensure
    that the user can reliably replicate the bug, and that the user can test the patched
    program. Without this help from the user, debugging is reduced to little more
    than guessing. It's generally not worth proceeding. If that is not an option,
    then you should at least try to construct some sort of test case for any possible
    patch, to confirm that the patch does do something useful even if you can't verify
    that it fixes the original bug.

    very difficult to figure out what triggers it, and how to replicate it. In this
    frustrating situation, I only know of one reliable approach, which is to automatically
    log all potentially relevant events, and save the logs when the bug occurs. In
    some cases it's particularly useful to be able to replay the program using the
    log, which can be a powerful mechanism for replicating a bug. Of course this requires
    a logging facility, and adding one to a large program can be a large undertaking.
    Nevertheless, it's probably worth doing the second time you find yourself searching
    for a bug which appears to occur randomly.

    debugger. The name of this tool makes it seem like the tool of choice for debugging--it
    seems logical that in order to debug you would use a debugger. However, this is
    inaccurate. As I said initially, debugging means removing bugs from programs;
    while a debugger is a powerful tool, one thing it does not do is remove bugs.

    approach is to start looking at the source code from the start of the program
    (e.g., the `main` function in a C program). Skim through the program, stepping
    down through functions, until you find the main center of action--in most programs,
    some sort of loop. This can normally be done fairly quickly. The nature of this
    center of action should tell you where to look in the source code for any particular
    activity. It should also tell you the general way in which the program acts.

    where a debugger can be very useful. If you are lucky enough to have a core dump,

    you are after.

    more manageable, such as conditional breakpoints, data watchpoints, ignoring breakpoints
    certain numbers of time, and support for executing simple code at breakpoints.
    These features are very useful when locating bad behaviour in code which is executed
    many times, and only fails under particular circumstances. It's a good idea to
    learn the features which your debugger provides.

    occur when the program is run under a debugger, even though it can be reliably
    replicated without the debugger; this typically indicates a problem which depends
    upon precise timing or memory layout. In other cases, you may not have access
    to a debugger, or the debugger may not be very powerful; this can happen when
    working on embedded systems or other impoverished programming environments, or
    when using programming features which are not supported by the debugger (for example,
    in some environments, threads).

    the bad behaviour. Add print statements to relevant locations, rebuild the program,
    replicate the problem with the new program, and use the print statements to hone
    in on exactly what code is being executed when the problem occurs. Ideally the
    program already has some sort of logging facility which you can reuse. Even if
    it doesn't, you should consider a systematic approach to the print statements
    you add, so that you can build on that when doing future debugging of the same
    program. In particular, every print statement should clearly indicate where it
    is located in the program, so that it can be quickly found again later.

    data structures are in a valid state. Such routines can help narrow down where
    data corruption occurs. If the check routines are fast, you may want to always

    to turn them on when you need them.

    code inspection. This is the only option if you can't replicate the problem. A

    by simply reading the source code. You will have to guess at likely possibilities,

    a compiler bug too quickly. However, they do happen--they've all happened to me--so

    or the OS by writing a check program, and verify a bug in the compiler by examining
