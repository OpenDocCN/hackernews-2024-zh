    a suburb of St. Louis, comes a month after [Target announced only those buying
    10 items](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/target-self-checkout-limit-10-items/) or
    less could use the self-checkout lane at its stores, and [Dollar General reduced
    self-checkout at thousands of its locations](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dollar-stores-family-dollar-dollar-tree-closing-inflation-food-stamps/).
    The latter removed the option entirely at 300 locations most-impacted by shoplifting.

    Saunders, managing director, retail, at GlobalData. "They are trying to see how
    does this play a role in the future, but it's not going to be the same thing they've
    done for decades, where it's a free-for-all, and anyone could use it," he told
    CBS MoneyWatch. There is a lot more caution."

    to stores across the country, we''re converting the self-checkout lanes at our
    7437 Watson Road store in Shrewsbury, MO., to traditional checkout lanes," a Walmart
    spokesperson emailed CBS MoneyWatch. "We believe the change will improve the in-store
    shopping experience and give our associates the chance to provide more personalized
    and efficient service."'

    pandemic, allowing shoppers to limit their contact with others and helping to
    relieve a labor shortage that made staffing registers more difficult.

    and the appeal of self-checkout lost some of its allure.

    of the service, and they have to do more of the work. So it''s not good for driving

    who noted that shoppers also make genuine mistakes, such as not scanning items
    properly. "Retailers are very actively trying to reduce it, or in Target''s case
    put more restrictions around self-checkout to try to reduce the losses they incur
    from it."'

    shrink had increased in 2023 "in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout."
