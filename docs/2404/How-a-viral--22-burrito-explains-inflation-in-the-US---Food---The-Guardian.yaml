- en: Ricardo Lopez’s taqueria is famous for a melt-in-your-mouth birria recipe that
    takes three days to prepare. Every week, hundreds of customers flock to La Vaca
    Birria in San Francisco’s Mission District for a taste of the slow-braised beef
    served over rice and beans or tucked into a crispy taco with a side of rich dipping
    broth.

    figure even in the pricey city. The move rankled some customers, with one posting
    a scathing review that expressed disbelief at how the burrito’s price had doubledfrom
    $11 just two years ago.

    some cases, almost doubled. He shared the receipts with the Guardian to verify
    the prices; for some items, he could not find receipts from 2021, so we relied
    on his memory of the price. (These prices are different from his Instagram estimates,
    since they’re based on different dates.)

    oil up, as well as having effects on global supplies of wheat and petroleum.

    said, they haven’t jumped as much as the 100% increase in La Vaca Birria’s burrito.

    he had tried to keep the price of his food as low as possible, worried that people
    would not try something new that was also pricey. In November 2023, Lopez wrote
    on Instagram, his business account was overdrawn. Then, just days later, a San
    Francisco Chronicle reviewer crowned La Vaca Birria [the best burrito in the Mission

    can compete with big chains on the cost of their food, Volpe, the food chain economist,

    rational choice.

    business partner and the restaurant serves all-halal meat. That means they attract
    enthusiastic Muslim customers from as far as Sacramento, but also that they don’t
    serve pork, which, at about $2 a pound, is substantially cheaper than beef, Lopez
    says. While other Mexican restaurants can make higher margins on their pork al
    pastor or carnitas burritos, he said, La Vaca Birria doesn’t have that option.

    from his grandfather. It takes an hour just to clean the seeds and the stems from
    the dried chillis for the spice mix that flavors it. The beef is marinated overnight,
    then braised in the oven at a low temperature for six hours, and then has to chill
    in the fridge for a full day. At the end, scrubbing the beef pans can take another
    hour.
