    to a swift reprimand by the lunch monitor. He could even lose precious play time
    for excessive talking.

    more time for electives and special academicprogramming that made their school
    best in its class. The intent was to maximize instructional time for the school’s
    prized technology and Spanish lessons – in theory, a good idea. That meant shaving
    minutes off other activities, and the school found that 15 minutes was not enough
    time to eat if the children were allowed to talk.

    is troubling. It’s unclear how common silent lunch is as a normal part of the
    school day; some schools only use [silent lunches as a punitive measure](https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/1b5tm1a/punitive_silent_lunch_elementary_school/),
    and others implemented it as a protective policy during the pandemic. Yet many,

    of Covid-19.

    for more enrichment or to save money on staffing our chronically underfunded public
    schools. But they come at a serious cost to students’ wellbeing. It is a well-documented
    fact that [rushed eating](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/school_lunch.htm)
    means less time for students to make choices about what they want to eat and results
    in our children eating fewer fruits and vegetables.

    practices are stifling our children’s emotional and social development. We pay
    lip service to mental wellness all the time. At that highly rated school, my son’s
    class got regular lessons about making friends and being inclusive from the school
    social worker. But in reality, the system was rigged against developing the very
    connection and empathy skills that ensure longterm emotional health.

    class from his two closest friends. Due to staggered recess, the only time of
    the day he saw his old friends was at lunch, when he wasn’t allowed to speak to
    them. Silent lunch deprived him of the opportunity to practice important social
    skills at a critical time in his childhood, and it actively discouraged the development
    of fundamental friendships.

    for my son. I just assumed it had improved somewhat in the 35 yearssince I’d eaten
    lunch at my elementary school. An intimidating lunch monitor clutched a 3ft wooden
    paddle as she surveyed the cafeteria in my rural Mississippi elementary school.
    Anyone considered disruptive got banished to the end of the line. In other cases,
    she detoured students into the hallway and gave them their “licks” before returning
    them to the line. Fewer states allow the threat of corporal punishment now(though
    [it’s more than you might think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/08/10/school-paddling-corporal-punishment/)).
    But even with the threat of paddling, we were allowed to talk, barter snacks and
    share secrets and face time when we sat down at our tables with our trays or lunch
    boxes.

    Elementary schools fail to prioritize mental health because college admissions
    and rankings give it little or no value. Schools and parents alike are constantly
    being asked to choose between the pressure to excel academically and children’s
    mental health, stuffing their days with activities and neglecting rest and relationships.
    Silent lunches are a natural outgrowth of this panicky, winner-take-all culture
    that privileges getting into the best schools over a child’s growing into their
    possible best self.

    I am saying the federal government should encourage school lunch programs to follow
    its own advice – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends at
    least 20 minutes of sit-down time for lunch – and treat time around the table
    as the life-giving work that it is. This work may not boost school ratings, but
    it is far from a waste of time.
