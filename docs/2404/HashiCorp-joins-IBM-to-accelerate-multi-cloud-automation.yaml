    HashiCorp has signed an agreement to be acquired by IBM to accelerate the multi-cloud
    automation journey we started almost 12 years ago. I’m hugely excited by this
    announcement and believe this is an opportunity to further the HashiCorp mission
    and to expand to a much broader audience with the support of IBM.

    than today. Mitchell and I were first exposed to public clouds as hobbyists, experimenting
    with startup ideas, and later as professional developers building mission-critical
    applications. That experience made it clear that automation was absolutely necessary
    for cloud infrastructure to be managed at scale. The transformative impact of
    the public cloud also made it clear that we would inevitably live in a multi-cloud
    world. Lastly, it was clear that adoption of this technology would be driven by
    our fellow practitioners who were reimagining the infrastructure landscape.

    world for a community of practitioners. Today, I’m incredibly proud of everything
    that we have achieved together. Our products are downloaded hundreds of millions
    of times each year by our passionate community of users. Each year, we certify
    tens of thousands of new users on our products, who use our tools each and every
    day to manage their applications and infrastructure.

    organizations in the world, to power their journey to multi-cloud. They have trusted
    us with their mission-critical applications and core infrastructure. One of the
    most rewarding aspects of infrastructure is quietly underpinning incredible applications
    around the world. We are proud to enable [millions of players to game together](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/how-we-used-the-hashistack-to-transform-the-world-of-roblox), [deliver

    connect self-driving cars, and secure trillions of dollars of transactions daily.
    This is why we’ve always believed that infrastructure enables innovation.

    the company. We’ve continued to work with our community and customers to identify
    their challenges in adopting multi-cloud infrastructure and transitioning to zero
    trust approaches to security. These challenges have in turn become opportunities
    for us to build new products and services on top of the HashiCorp Cloud Platform.
