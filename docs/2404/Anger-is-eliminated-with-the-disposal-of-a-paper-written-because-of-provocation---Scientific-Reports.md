### Introduction

The need to control anger has been of importance for a long time in human societies, as inferred by a philosopher in Imperium Romanum who had already explored how to cease being angry^([1](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR1 "Seneca, L. A. Seneca Moral Essays, Vol. 1\. De ira [Anger] (J. W. Basore, Ed. and Trans.) (Original work published 45) (W. Heinemann, 1928).")). However, it can still be challenging to suppress anger effectively. Frequent, unregulated anger often leads to violence towards children^([2](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR2 "Rodriguez, C. M. & Green, A. J. Parenting stress and anger expression as predictors of child abuse potential. Child Abuse Negl. 21(4), 367–377\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/s0145-2134(96)00177-9                                     (1997).")), which has become an increasingly prevalent issue. One study found that the global estimate for children experiencing any form of violence (physical, sexual, emotional, or a combination) in the past year is one billion children aged 2–17 years^([3](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR3 "Moody, G., Cannings-John, R., Hood, K., Kemp, A. & Robling, M. Establishing the international prevalence of self-reported child maltreatment: A systematic review by maltreatment type and gender.

The number of child abuse cases in Japan has reportedly doubled in the past decade^([4](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR4 "Child and Family Policy Bureau, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Trends in the Number of Cases of Child Abuse at Child Guidance Center (accessed 25 January 2023).                    https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/001040752.pdf                                    . (in Japanese).")). Children learn about appropriate emotional expression and behaviour from their parents^([5](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR5 "Denham, S. & Kochanoff, A. T. Parental contributions to preschoolers’ understanding of emotion. Marriage Fam. Rev. 34(3–4), 311–343\.                    https://doi.org/10.1300/J002v34n03_06                                     (2002).")), and children who have been maltreated may lack the opportunity to learn how to regulate anger. Consequently, these maltreated children may have difficulty controlling their own anger^([6](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR6 "Heleniak, C., Jenness, J. L., Vander Stoep, A., McCauley, E. & McLaughlin, K. A.

D., Cicchetti, D., Hornung, K. & Reed, A. Recognizing emotion in faces: Developmental effects of child abuse and neglect. Dev. Psychol. 36(5), 679–688\.                    https://doi.org/10.1037//0012-1649.36.5.679                                     (2000).")), and tend to exhibit externalizing behaviour problems^([8](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR8 "Denham, S. A. et al. Prediction of externalizing behavior problems from early to middle childhood: The role of parental socialization and emotion expression. Dev. Psychopathol. 12(1), 23–45\.                    https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579400001024                                     (2000).")). These studies suggest that parental anger regulation issues negatively affect children’s emotional competence. Therefore, an effective way of reducing anger has been examined throughout the years^([9](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR9 "Beames, J. R., O’Dean, S. M., Grisham, J. R., Moulds, M. L. & Denson, T. F. Anger regulation in interpersonal contexts: Anger experience, aggressive behavior, and cardiovascular reactivity. J. Soc. Pers.

However, simply attempting to suppress anger is usually not effective^([10](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR10 "Szasz, P. L., Szentagotai, A. & Hofmann, S. G. The effect of emotion regulation strategies on anger. Behav. Res. Ther. 49(2), 114–119\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011                                     (2011).")). Both cognitive reappraisal and distraction (i.e., thinking about something other than provocative comments) could reduce anger; however, distraction could suppress anger only for a transient period of time^([11](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR11 "Fabiansson, E. C. & Denson, T. F. The effects of intrapersonal anger and its regulation in economic bargaining. Plos One 7(12), e51595\.                    https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051595                                     (2012).")). Cognitive reappraisal refers to the reinterpretation or modification of the meaning of an unpleasant situation. Although reappraisal is considered as an effective way to reduce anger^([12](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR12 "Denson, T. F., Moulds, M. L. & Grisham, J. R. The effects of analytical rumination, reappraisal, and distraction on anger experience. Behav. Ther. 43(2), 355–364\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2011.08.001                                     (2012).")), it requires greater cognitive effort^([13](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR13 "Kross, E. & Ayduk, O. Self-distancing: Theory, research, and current directions. Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol. 55(55), 81–136\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aesp.2016.10.002                                     (2017)."),[14](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR14 "Orvell, A., Ayduk, O., Moser, J.

Therefore, reappraisal under stressful situations which require cognitive load was not found to be effective in reducing anger as compared to non-stressful situations^([15](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR15 "Zhan, J. et al. Regulating anger under stress via cognitive reappraisal and sadness. Front. Psychol. 8, 1372\.                    https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01372                                     (2017).")). Self-distancing, which may be responsible for the anger-reducing effect of reappraisal^([12](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR12 "Denson, T. F., Moulds, M. L. & Grisham, J. R. The effects of analytical rumination, reappraisal, and distraction on anger experience. Behav. Ther. 43(2), 355–364\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2011.08.001                                     (2012).")) is also considered as an effective way to reduce anger. Nevertheless, self-distancing or reflection on one’s provocation from a distance is often not feasible, especially in the heat of the moment^([13](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR13 "Kross, E. & Ayduk, O. Self-distancing: Theory, research, and current directions. Adv. Exp. Soc. Psychol. 55(55), 81–136\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aesp.2016.10.002                                     (2017).")).

Failure to reduce anger can lead an individual to think about a provocative event repeatedly. Such ruminations are often produced in a self-immersed, experiential manner^([16](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR16 "Ayduk, O. & Kross, E. From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 98(5), 809–829\.                    https://doi.org/10.1037/a0019205                                     (2010).")). Self-immersed experiential rumination can lead to reliving past provocative events^([17](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR17 "Kross, E., Ayduk, O. & Mischel, W. When asking “why” does not hurt - Distinguishing rumination from reflective processing of negative emotions. Psychol. Sci. 16(9), 709–715\.                    https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01600.x                                     (2005).")), thus maintaining or even increasing subjective anger and vascular responses^([18](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR18 "Glynn, L. M., Christenfeld, N. & Gerin, W. Recreating cardiovascular responses with rumination: The effects of a delay between harassment and its recall. Int. J. Psychophysiol. 66(2), 135–140\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2007.03.018                                     (2007).")).

However, among the types of ruminations, writing down a provocation event does not always maintain or increase anger; instead, anger is suppressed depending on the way of writing. For instance, anger was suppressed when participants wrote down the anger-inducing event in a detached, informational, ‘cool’ manner. However, their anger was not suppressed (and was maintained or even increased) when they failed to write down the event in an analytical manner, and wrote it down in a ‘hot’ (emotional) manner^([12](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR12 "Denson, T. F., Moulds, M. L. & Grisham, J. R. The effects of analytical rumination, reappraisal, and distraction on anger experience. Behav. Ther. 43(2), 355–364\.                    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2011.08.001                                     (2012).")). Somewhat relevant here is the expressive writing technique^([19](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR19 "Pennebaker, J. W. Expressive writing in psychological science. Perspect. Psychol. Sci. 13(2), 226–229\.                    https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691617707315                                     (2018).")), which is frequently used in emotion-focused psychotherapy treatment^([20](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR20 "Fuentes, A. M. M., Kahn, J. H. & Lannin, D. G. Emotional disclosure and emotion change during an expressive-writing task: Do pronouns matter?. Curr.

It is believed to be effective in suppressing anger in clinical settings. However, only one experimental study using this technique has been conducted, wherein it was found that there was a significant likelihood of reduced anger when sentences about the emotion were written in the past tense^([21](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR21 "Pasupathi, M., Wainryb, C., Mansfield, C. D. & Bourne, S. The feeling of the story: Narrating to regulate anger and sadness. Cogn.

These studies suggest that anger may be successfully suppressed if individuals are able to separate their internal experience of provocative events from their sense of self^([22](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR22 "Bernstein, A. et al. Decentering and related constructs: A critical review and metacognitive processes model. Perspect. Psychol. Sci. 10(5), 599–617\.                    https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615594577                                     (2015).")). Healy et al.^([23](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR23 "Healy, H. A. et al. An experimental test of a cognitive defusion exercise: Coping with negative and positive self-statements. Psychol.

These previous studies emphasised the cognitive processes (such as goals or valuations) that occur almost entirely inside individuals’ heads^([24](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR24 "Koole, S. L. & Veenstra, L. Does emotion regulation occur only inside people’s heads? Toward a situated cognition analysis of emotion-regulatory dynamics. Psychol.

However, if we look at the literature more broadly, studies on emotion regulation (a situated cognitive approach) have demonstrated successful emotion control through dynamic interplay between the person and the situation^([24](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR24 "Koole, S. L. & Veenstra, L. Does emotion regulation occur only inside people’s heads? Toward a situated cognition analysis of emotion-regulatory dynamics. Psychol.

From this situated cognition perspective, people perceive their environment in terms of the possibilities for the kinds of actions that they would pursue. These functional features of the environment (affordances) do not solely exist inside an individual’s mind but instead have a physical reality that exists in the individual’s relationship with the environment. For instance, people frequently use physical substances to modify their moods. People may take a hot shower when they feel lonely^([26](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR26 "Bargh, J. A. & Shalev, I. The substitutability of physical and social warmth in daily life.

Such access to physical objects can significantly modify individuals’ ability to manage their emotions.

In this study, we developed a new anger reduction strategy inspired by the situated cognition approach to emotion regulation^([24](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR24 "Koole, S. L. & Veenstra, L. Does emotion regulation occur only inside people’s heads? Toward a situated cognition analysis of emotion-regulatory dynamics. Psychol.

Relevant to this approach, the notion of a grounded procedure of separation^([29](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR29 "Lee, S. W. S. & Schwarz, N. Grounded procedures: A proximate mechanism for the psychology of cleansing and other physical actions. Behav. Brain Sci. 44, e1\.                    https://doi.org/10.1017/s0140525x20000308                                     (2021).")) also assumes that mental representations and functions are grounded in one’s own experiences and interactions with physical reality. For instance, if people want to take revenge through permanent removal (e.g. hatred for ex), they may destroy a related entity such that it is no longer recognisable (burn, melt, or tear related). In a related study, Briñol et al.^([30](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR30 "Brinol, P., Gasco, M., Petty, R. E. & Horcajo, J.

These attitude changes may derive from the cognitive fusion that people often fuse with physical objects, such as jewellery, cars, and family heirlooms^([31](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR31 "Hatvany, T., Burkley, E. & Curtis, J.

Such fused objects are valued more and are less likely to be abandoned because doing so means losing a part of themselves^([32](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR32 "Belk, R. W. Possessions and the extended self. J. Consum. Res. 15(2), 139–168\.                    https://doi.org/10.1086/209154                                     (1988)."),[33](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR33 "Reb, J. & Connolly, T. Possession, feelings of ownership and the endowment effect. Judgm. Decis. Mak. J. 2(2), 107–114 (2007).")). Specifically, throwing an object associated with negative emotions (anger) may result in losing the negative emotions (anger). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has tested whether the disposal of anger-written paper can reduce or even eliminate anger.

Previous studies from a situated cognitive approach to anger management have changed the external environment of the individual in anger. Tool (object) use has received scant attention in these situated cognition approaches to anger management, except for a few studies, such as hitting a punching bag^([34](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR34 "Bushman, B.

This study examined a method in which the disposal of a paper (object) on which participants wrote down their descriptions or thoughts about a provocative event could neutralise anger. Participants threw the anger-written paper into a trash box in Experiment 1, and put the paper into a shredder in Experiment 2\. If the action of disposal is crucial to modifying emotions, anger would be reduced only in participants in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2, as predicted by the grounded separation procedure^([29](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR29 "Lee, S.

### Materials and method

#### Participants

A total of 57 students (women = 21, mean age = 21.11, *SD* = 1.05) from a local university participated in this experiment. The data from seven participants were excluded from the final analysis because they correctly guessed the purpose of the experiment and they did not express induced anger by insult (subjective ratings of anger were lower or the same compared to those of the baseline), as was the case in a previous study^([36](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR36 "Mauss, I. B., Cook, C. L. & Gross, J. J. Automatic emotion regulation during anger provocation. J. Exp. Soc.

Our final analysis included 50 participants (women = 16, mean age = 21.10, *SD* = 1.08). A sample size of 50 participants was determined by G*Power 3.1.9.4^([37](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR37 "Faul, F., Erdfelder, E., Lang, A. G. & Buchner, A.

Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences 2nd edn. (Routledge, 1988).                    https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203771587                                    ."))), alpha level of 0.05, a within-subjects measurement correlation of 0.5, and a nonsphericity correction ε of 1\. The calculation suggested a sample size of 22 participants in each group. Based on these analyses, we concluded that the sample size was appropriate for this study.

#### Materials

Angry feelings were assessed with five adjective items: angry, bothered, annoyed, hostile, and irritated. These adjectives were previously used as measures of self-reported anger^([39](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR39 "Mischkowski, D., Kross, E. & Bushman, B. J.

In this study, each response scale ranged from 1 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). As was the case in a previous study on anger^([40](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR40 "Kubo, K., Okanoya, K. & Kawai, N.

We also used Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) as a subjective scale to assess mainly negative feelings^([38](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR38 "Cohen, J. Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences 2nd edn. (Routledge, 1988).                    https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203771587                                    .")). We used the Japanese version of the 6-point PANAS scale^([41](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR41 "Sato, T. & Yasuda, A.

#### Procedure

In this experiment, participants' subjective emotional states were measured at three time points (baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing). The participants were told to write an essay on social problems (e.g., smoking in public) for which they would receive feedback from a doctoral student assessing the quality of the essay. They had seen the doctoral student before entering the experimental room. After the participants wrote the essay, they completed the PANAS and anger questionnaires for the baseline. The evaluation by the fictitious doctoral student was then provided to the participants. The evaluation included ratings of the essay on six characteristics using a 9-point scale (e.g. for intelligence, 1 = unintelligent, 9 = intelligent). All participants were given the following ratings: intelligence = 3, interest = 3, friendliness = 2, logic = 3, respectability = 4, and rationality = 3\. Each essay was also provided with the following comment: ‘I cannot believe an educated person would think like this. I hope this person learns something while at the university’^([40](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR40 "Kubo, K., Okanoya, K. & Kawai, N.

All of these manipulations were successfully used in our previous study^([40](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR40 "Kubo, K., Okanoya, K. & Kawai, N. Apology isn’t good enough: An apology suppresses an approach motivation but not the physiological and psychological anger.

The participants were required to read the feedback ratings and comments silently for two minutes. Then, they filled out the subjective emotional questionnaires (PANAS and anger adjectives) for the post-provocation period.

Then, the participants were asked to write every thought of them on receiving the feedback and were given three minutes for this. The instruction was ‘Think about the event from your own perspective. Concentrate especially on the things that originally triggered the emotions and your reactions’. We added guide questions (‘Why were you feeling this way?’, ‘What made you feel this way?’) to induce analytical rumination. To allow the participants to write about their honest feelings, they were informed that the written paper would not be seen by anyone, including the experimenter. After writing, the participants were asked to review the sentences carefully for 30 s. For the retention group, the paper was turned over, put in a clear plastic folder, and placed on the right side of the desk. The participants in the disposal group rolled up the paper into a crumpled ball, stood up, threw the paper into the trash can held by the experimenter, and sat back in the chair. Finally, both groups of participants filled out the subjective emotional questionnaires (anger adjectives and PANAS) for the post-writing period. At the end of the experiment, all participants were debriefed and informed of the truth. They were also assured that the evaluations of their essays had been prepared in advance.

### Data analyses

Angry feelings were analysed using a 2 (group: disposal or retention) × 3 (period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) ANOVA. All significance levels were set at *p* < 0.05\. We used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction when Mauchly’s test of sphericity was violated. When the interaction was significant, multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction method were used to assess the differences.

We also report Bayes factors (BFs) from the Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA in *JASP*^([43](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR43 "JASP Team. (2020). JASP (Version 0.7) [Computer software].                    https://jasp-stats.org                                    ")). For BFs, BF[10] values reflect the probability of an alternative relative to the null hypothesis. BFs greater than 3 indicate support for the hypotheses. A BF favouring the alternative over the null hypothesis (BF[10]) offers strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis when it is over 10\. Values less than 0.33 indicate support for the null hypothesis, and values between 0.33 and 3 indicate data insensitivity. We also reported 95% confidence intervals.

We aimed to examine (1) whether angry feelings resumed in the disposal group, and (2) whether angry feelings were different between the groups after the disposal or retention treatments. Our main interest was angry feelings, while we also verified PANAS scores using a 2 (group: disposal or retention) × 3 (period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) ANOVA.

#### Ethics statement

All participants were paid for their participation and had provided written informed consent in accordance with the procedures before participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences at Nagoya University (201104-C-02–02). All methods were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided their written and informed consent prior to starting the study.

### Results

#### Anger experience

The left panel of Fig. [1](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#Fig1) shows mean subjective ratings of anger for disposal and retention groups at three time points (baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing). Subjective ratings of anger of both groups increased at the post-provocation (*M*[*disposal*] = 3.34, *SD* = 1.20, 95% CI [2.86, 3.82]; *M*[*retention*] = 3.45, *SD* = 1.11, 95% CI [3.00, 3.89]) from the baseline (*M*[*disposal*] = 1.59, *SD* = 0.50, 95% CI [1.39, 1.79]; *M*[*retention*] = 1.78, *SD* = 0.71, 95% CI [1.50, 2.07]). Subjective ratings at the post-writing decreased from the post-provocation, however those of retention group were still higher than the baseline (*M*[*retention*] = 2.64, *SD* = 0.95, 95% CI [2.26, 3.02]), while those of disposal group eliminated at the same level of the baseline (*M*[*disposal*] = 1.87, *SD* = 0.71, 95% CI [1.59, 2.16]). A 2 (group: disposal or retention) × 3 (period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of period [*F* (2, 96) = 73.36, *p* < 0.001, partial *η*² = 0.60, BF[10] > 100], while a main effect of group was not significant [*F* (1, 48) = 3.21, *p* > 0.05, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.06, BF[10] = 0.66]. The interaction between group and period was significant [*F* (2, 96) = 3.12, *p* < 0.05, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.06, BF[10] = 1.17]. Multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method revealed that the subjective anger was significantly higher at the post-provocation than those at the baseline (*p* < 0.05), indicating that a provocative manipulation was exerted. Subjective ratings of anger post-writing decreased significantly, compared to post-provocation (*p* < 0.05). Importantly, however, subjective ratings of retention group at the post-writing period were still significantly higher than those of the baseline period (*p* < 0.05), whereas those of disposal group at the post-writing period eliminated to levels of the baseline period (*p* > 0.05). Subjective ratings of disposal group at the post-writing period were significantly lower than those of retention group (*p* < 0.01).

#### Negative and positive affect

The negative affect subscale of the PANAS at post-provocation (*M*[*disposal*] = 3.10, *SD* = 1.00, 95% CI [2.70, 3.49]; *M*[*retention*] = 3.06, *SD* = 1.03, 95% CI [2.64, 3.47]) was higher than at baseline (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.45, *SD* = 0.66, 95% CI [2.18, 2.71]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.50, *SD* = 0.84, 95% CI [2.16, 2.83]) and post-writing (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.06, *SD* = 0.65, 95% CI [1.80, 2.32]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.39, *SD* = 0.88, 95% CI [2.04, 2.73]). The 95% CIs of the disposal group overlapped a little bit between post-provocation [2.70, 3.49] and baseline periods [2.18, 2.71], and those of the retention group overlapped between both the post-provocation [2.64, 3.47] and baseline [2.16, 2.83]. The 95% CIs for the post-writing means partially overlapped between the groups. A 2 (group) × 3 (period) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of period [*F* (2, 96) = 28.64, *p* < 0.001, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.37, BF[10] > 100]. However, the main effect of group [*F* (1, 48) = 0.29, *p* > 0.05, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.01, BF[10] = 0.32] and the interaction between group and period were not significant [*F* (2, 96) = 1.35, *p* > 0.05, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.03, BF[10] = 0.31]. Multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method revealed that the subjective negative affect post-provocation was significantly higher than at baseline and post-writing (*ps* < 0.05).

The PANAS positive affect subscale showed little variation at three periods (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.33, *SD* = 0.80, 95% CI [2.01, 2.65]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.32, *SD* = 0.75, 95% CI [2.01, 2.62]), post-provocation (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.44, *SD* = 0.76, 95% CI [2.13, 2.75]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.42, *SD* = 0.89, 95% CI [2.06, 2.78]), and post-writing (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.38, *SD* = 0.87, 95% CI [2.03, 2.73]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.27, *SD* = 0.83, 95% CI [1.93, 2.60]). A 2 × 3 mixed ANOVA revealed that neither main effects nor interaction was significant (*Fs* < 0.90, *ps* > 0.41, BF[10]s < 0.14).

### Discussion

This study examined whether writing about the provocative event and disposing of the paper into a trash can would suppress anger. The provocation treatments evoked anger in both the groups similarly. Nevertheless, the retention group still showed significantly higher anger compared to levels at the baseline period, while the disposal group completely eliminated their anger after the disposal of the anger-written paper. These results suggest that the disposal of the paper containing ruminated anger into the trash can neutralise anger. Our interpretation is that the act of throwing the paper with ruminated anger into the trash can produces a feeling similar to the psychological existence (anger) being discarded, leading to anger elimination, since the psychological entity (anger) was disposed along with the physical object (anger-written paper).

One may argue that it was not the disposal itself but the physical distance played a critical role in reducing anger. Since the paper was distanced from participants in the disposal group, whereas the paper in the retention group was located by them. Nevertheless, Zhang et al.^([44](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR44 "Zhang, Y., Risen, J. L. & Hosey, C. Reversing one’s fortune by pushing away bad luck. J. Exp. Psychol. General 143(3), 1171–1184\.                    https://doi.org/10.1037/a0034023                                     (2014).")) showed that engaging in an avoidance action rather than creating physical distance was critical for reversing the perceived effect of negative thoughts. In their study (Experiment 5), participants in avoidance action conditions either threw the ball to the opposite corner of the room (creating physical distance between themselves and the ball), or pretended to throw the ball (creating no distance between themselves and the ball). Participants in the no-avoidance action condition either carried the ball to the opposite corner of the room and left it there (creating physical distance between the self and the ball without involving a throwing action) or held the ball in their non-dominant hand (creating no distance). Participants in both avoidance action conditions reversed the negative thoughts, while participants in both no-avoidance conditions did not. Avoidance actions were crucial in their study. Therefore, the physical distance would not contribute to reduce anger in this study. However, disposal action might be the key to neutralising anger in this study. Nevertheless, we assume that the meaning (i.e. interpretation) of disposal is more important than the action itself. Other studies have also suggested that the meaning of an action is critical for determining its impact, not the action itself^([30](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR30 "Brinol, P., Gasco, M., Petty, R. E. & Horcajo, J. Treating thoughts as material objects can increase or decrease their impact on evaluation. Psychol. Sci. 24(1), 41–47\.                    https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612449176                                     (2013)."),[45](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR45 "Brinol, P., Petty, R.

This study could not exclude throwing action's potential contribution to neutralising anger. Thus, we conducted another experiment to exclude the potential contribution of the throwing action as much as possible, confirm the effectiveness of the disposal method, and explore the variation in this method.
