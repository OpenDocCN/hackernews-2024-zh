    and start investigating. A colleague uses the staging environment to do a `helm
    rollback` and it works as expected, the previous version of the service is successfully
    deployed.

- en: You investigate logs. The `helm rollback` call worked as expected, and then
    it began deleting every entity related to the deployment. Pods, secrets, ingresses,
    *everything* related to the service was gone, and your name was present on each
    deletion.

    and had to get other work done. But you couldn’t really move on from this issue
    mentally, could you?

    looking at the open issues and throwing in some keywords that might be relevant,
    such as “rollback”.

    of Helm packaged in Fedora Linux included a patch that introduced this issue.
    You then use the staging environment to reproduce the issue. Everything was gone,
    again, but this time in a safer environment.
