    (`self`). Also, you can see that `self.name` while inside the person class is
    identical to `Person.name` while outside it.

    `class << Person`, we are setting `self` to `Person`'s metaclass for the duration
    of the block. As a result, the `species` method is added to `Person`'s metaclass,
    rather than the class itself.

    `self` equal to the `Person` class. Next, we do `class << self`, making `self`
    equal to `Person`'s metaclass. When we then define the `species` method, it is
    defined on `Person`'s metaclass.

    apart the `self` into the `self` that is used to execute methods and the `self`
    that is used when new methods are defined. When `instance_eval` is used, new methods
    are defined on the **metaclass**, but the `self` is the object itself.

    out of Ruby's semantics. After this explanation, it should be clear that `def
    Person.species`, `class << Person; def species`, and `class Person; class << self;
    def species` aren't three ways to achieve the same thing **by design**, but that
    they arise out of Ruby's flexibility with regard to specifying what `self` is
    at any given point in your program.

    rather than act as a keyword, it captures the local variables surrounding it.
    This can provide powerful DSL capabilities, in addition to controlling the `self`
    used in a code block. But other than that, they are exactly identical to the other
    constructs used here.

    inherits from Module) and is an alias for `module_eval`. Additionally, `instance_exec`,
    which was added to Ruby in 1.8.7, works exactly like `instance_eval`, except that
    it also allows you to send variables into the block.
