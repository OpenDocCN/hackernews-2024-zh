- en: The introduction of such a large number of robots into the workforce raises
    questions about the future role of human labor in Amazon’s operational model.
    The impact on jobs, particularly tasks that are highly repetitive and could be
    easily automated, is a concern for many. Research from institutions like the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT) has shown that industrial robots have a significant
    negative impact on workers, affecting jobs and wages in the areas where they are
    deployed. The broader discussion on the economic and political consequences of
    automation highlights widespread fears of job displacement and the potential for
    increased income inequality.

    of skilled job types that previously didn't exist at the company, suggesting that
    automation can also lead to the creation of new types of employment opportunities.
    This evolution within Amazon’s workforce could reflect a shift in the nature of
    work where human employees move toward more complex, nonrepetitive tasks that
    require higher levels of skill and creativity.

    ensuring that the gains from increased productivity are shared broadly across
    the workforce.
