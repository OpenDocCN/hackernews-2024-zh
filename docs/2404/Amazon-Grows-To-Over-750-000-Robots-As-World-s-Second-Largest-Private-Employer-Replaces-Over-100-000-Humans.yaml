    that's a lot, it's a decrease of over 100,000 employees from the 1.6 million workers
    it had in 2021\. Meanwhile, the company had 520,000 robots in 2022 and 200,000
    robots in 2019\. While Amazon is bringing on hundreds of thousands of robots per
    year, the company is slowly decreasing its employee numbers.

    repetitive tasks, thereby improving efficiency, safety and delivery speed for
    [Amazon](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earn-3-9-yield-amazon-144915357.html)‘s
    customers. Sequoia, for example, speeds up inventory management and order processing
    in fulfillment centers, while Digit, a bipedal robot developed in collaboration
    with Agility Robotics, handles tasks like moving empty tote boxes.

    automation at the world's second-largest employer. The shift has the potential
    to significantly impact job dynamics within the company and beyond. While Amazon
    asserts that robots are meant to work collaboratively with human employees, assisting
    them with repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and workplace safety, concerns

- en: The introduction of such a large number of robots into the workforce raises
    questions about the future role of human labor in Amazon’s operational model.
    The impact on jobs, particularly tasks that are highly repetitive and could be
    easily automated, is a concern for many. Research from institutions like the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT) has shown that industrial robots have a significant
    negative impact on workers, affecting jobs and wages in the areas where they are
    deployed. The broader discussion on the economic and political consequences of
    automation highlights widespread fears of job displacement and the potential for
    increased income inequality.

- en: Despite these concerns, Amazon has pointed out the creation of 700 categories
    of skilled job types that previously didn't exist at the company, suggesting that
    automation can also lead to the creation of new types of employment opportunities.
    This evolution within Amazon’s workforce could reflect a shift in the nature of
    work where human employees move toward more complex, nonrepetitive tasks that
    require higher levels of skill and creativity.

    integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes industries and
    the labor market. The challenge for [Amazon](https://www.benzinga.com/money/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-stock?),
    and society at large, will be to navigate these changes in ways that maximize
    the benefits of automation while mitigating negative impacts on employment and
    ensuring that the gains from increased productivity are shared broadly across
    the workforce.
