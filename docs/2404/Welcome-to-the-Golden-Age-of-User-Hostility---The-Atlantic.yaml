    it seems, is more intrusive advertisements.

    a [dystopian patent](https://www.lowpass.cc/p/roku-hdmi-ad-insertion-patent?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=roku-explores-taking-over-hdmi-feeds-with-ads)
    filed last August by Roku, the television- and streaming-device manufacturer whose
    platform is used by tens of millions of people worldwide. The filing details plans
    for an “HDMI customized ad insertion,” which would allow TVs made by Roku to monitor
    video signals through the HDMI port—where users might connect a game console,
    a Blu-ray player, a cable box, or even another streaming device—and then inject
    targeted advertisements when content is paused. This would be a drastic extension
    of Roku’s surveillance potential: The company currently has no ability to see
    what users might be doing when they switch away from its proprietary streaming
    platform. This is apparently a problem, in that Roku is missing monetization opportunities!'

    me that the company had no plans to put HDMI ad insertion into any products at
    this time), it speaks to a dispiriting recent trend in consumer hardware. Internet-connected
    products can transform after the point of purchase in ways that can feel intrusive
    or even hostile to users. Another example from Roku: Just last month, the company
    presented users with an update to its terms of service, asking them to enter a
    pre-arbitration process that would make it harder to sue the company. On one hand,
    this isn’t so unusual—apps frequently force users to accept terms-of-service updates
    before proceeding. But on the other, it feels galling to be [locked out of using
    your television](https://community.roku.com/t5/Features-settings-updates/Roku-disables-players-and-TVs-with-attempt-to-coerce-arbitration-agreement/td-p/950649)
    altogether over a legal agreement: “Until I press ‘Agree’ my tv is essentially
    being held hostage and rendered useless,” one Roku customer [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1b4svu0/i_dont_agree_to_dispute_resolution_terms_update/)
    on Reddit. “I can’t even change the HDMI input.”'

    in order to use the company’s services but said that customers have the option
    to opt out, by sending a letter, in the actual mail, to the company’s general
    counsel (though the window to do so closed on March 21). “Like many companies,
    Roku updates its terms of service from time to time,” the spokesperson told me.
    “When we do, we take steps to make sure customers are informed of the change.”

    was a computer. They have now been mixed into an unholy brew by the internet and
    by opportunistic corporations, which have developed [“automatic content recognition”](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/12/12/your-smart-tv-knows-what-youre-watching)
    systems. These collect granular data about individual watching habits and log
    them into databases, which are then used to serve ads or sold to interested parties,
    such as [politicians](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/smart-tvs-collect-data-political-advertising-use/601381/).
    The slow surveillance colonization of everyday electronics was normalized by free
    internet services, which conditioned people to the mentality that our personal
    information is the actual cost of doing business: The TVs got cheaper, and [now
    we pay with our data](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/smart-tvs-sony-lg-cheap/672614/).
    Not only is this a bad deal; it fundamentally should not apply to *hardware and
    software that people purchase with money*. One Roku customer aptly summed up the
    frustration [recently](https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1775923997378515215) on

    and activist Cory Doctorow evocatively calls “[enshittification](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/netflix-streaming-password-sharing-family-household/672967/).”
    The term speaks to a pervasive cultural sense that things are getting worse, that
    the digital products we use are effectively being turned against us. For example:
    Apart from its ad-stuffed streaming devices, Roku also offers a remote-control
    app for smartphones. In a Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1bg956e/ads_in_roku_remote_app/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
    last month, a user attached a screenshot of a subtle ad module that the company
    inserted into the app well after launch—gently enshittifying the simple act of
    navigating your television screen. “Just wait until we have to sit through a 1
    minute video ad before we can use the remote,” one commenter wrote. “Don’t give
    them any ideas,” another replied.'

    on the ad faucet. Roku fits into this framework. The company [lost](https://stockdividendscreener.com/entertainment/roku-revenue-breakdown-profitability-and-margin/)
    $44 million on its physical devices last year but made almost $1.6 billion with
    its ads and services products. It turns out that Roku is actually an advertising
    company much like, say, Google and Meta. And marketing depends on captive audiences:
    commercial breaks, billboards that you can’t help but see on the highway, and

    card I used to purchase an ink-cartridge subscription expired. My printer *had*
    ink (that I’d paid for), but I couldn’t use it. It felt like extortion. Restrictive
    rights usage happens everywhere—with songs, movies, and audiobooks that play only
    on specific platforms, and with big, expensive physical tech products, such as
    cars. The entire concept of ownership now feels muddied. If HP can disable my

    Rushfield [recently](https://theankler.com/p/congrats-jay-penske-you-made-the)

    is more important than the audience”—and that consumers ultimately “have no choice
    but to buy tickets for the latest *Mission Impossible* or *Fast and Furious*—because
    they always have and we own them so they’ll see what we tell them to see.” People

    people feel have gotten worse because companies assume that consumers will accept
    inferior products, or that they have nowhere else to go. In this sense, Doctorow’s
    *enshittification* may transcend its original, digital meaning. Like *doomscrolling*,
    it gives language to an epochal ethos. “The problem is that all of this is getting
    worse, not better,” Doctorow told me last year when I interviewed him about my
    printer-extortion debacle. He was talking about companies locking consumers into
    frustrating ecosystems but also about consumer dismay at large. “The last thing

    Needing to do a hostage negotiation with your television is annoying—enraging,
    even—but it is only a small indignity. Much greater is the creeping sensation
    that it has become standard practice for the things we buy to fail us through
    subtle, technological betrayals. A little surveillance here, a little forced arbitration
    there. Add it up, and the real problem becomes existential. It sure feels like
    the inkjets are winning.
