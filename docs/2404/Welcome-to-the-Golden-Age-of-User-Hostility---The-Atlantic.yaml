    a [dystopian patent](https://www.lowpass.cc/p/roku-hdmi-ad-insertion-patent?utm_source=www.lowpass.cc&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=roku-explores-taking-over-hdmi-feeds-with-ads)
    filed last August by Roku, the television- and streaming-device manufacturer whose
    platform is used by tens of millions of people worldwide. The filing details plans
    for an “HDMI customized ad insertion,” which would allow TVs made by Roku to monitor
    video signals through the HDMI port—where users might connect a game console,
    a Blu-ray player, a cable box, or even another streaming device—and then inject
    targeted advertisements when content is paused. This would be a drastic extension
    of Roku’s surveillance potential: The company currently has no ability to see
    what users might be doing when they switch away from its proprietary streaming
    platform. This is apparently a problem, in that Roku is missing monetization opportunities!'

    me that the company had no plans to put HDMI ad insertion into any products at
    this time), it speaks to a dispiriting recent trend in consumer hardware. Internet-connected
    products can transform after the point of purchase in ways that can feel intrusive
    or even hostile to users. Another example from Roku: Just last month, the company
    presented users with an update to its terms of service, asking them to enter a
    pre-arbitration process that would make it harder to sue the company. On one hand,
    this isn’t so unusual—apps frequently force users to accept terms-of-service updates
    before proceeding. But on the other, it feels galling to be [locked out of using
    your television](https://community.roku.com/t5/Features-settings-updates/Roku-disables-players-and-TVs-with-attempt-to-coerce-arbitration-agreement/td-p/950649)

    being held hostage and rendered useless,” one Roku customer [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1b4svu0/i_dont_agree_to_dispute_resolution_terms_update/)

    counsel (though the window to do so closed on March 21). “Like many companies,
    Roku updates its terms of service from time to time,” the spokesperson told me.

    was a computer. They have now been mixed into an unholy brew by the internet and
    by opportunistic corporations, which have developed [“automatic content recognition”](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/12/12/your-smart-tv-knows-what-youre-watching)
    systems. These collect granular data about individual watching habits and log
    them into databases, which are then used to serve ads or sold to interested parties,
    such as [politicians](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/smart-tvs-collect-data-political-advertising-use/601381/).
    The slow surveillance colonization of everyday electronics was normalized by free

    Not only is this a bad deal; it fundamentally should not apply to *hardware and

    frustration [recently](https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1775923997378515215) on

    The term speaks to a pervasive cultural sense that things are getting worse, that
    the digital products we use are effectively being turned against us. For example:
    Apart from its ad-stuffed streaming devices, Roku also offers a remote-control
