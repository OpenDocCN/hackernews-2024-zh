- en: Ter Beek, who lives in a little Dutch town near the German border, once had
    ambitions to become a psychiatrist, but she was never able to muster the will
    to finish school or start a career. She said she was hobbled by her depression
    and autism and borderline personality disorder. Now she was tired of living—despite,
    she said, being in love with her boyfriend, a 40-year-old IT programmer, and living
    in a nice house with their two cats.

    “there’s nothing more we can do for you. It’s never gonna get any better.”

    tree is the opposite. It is losing its leaves, it is dying. And once the tree
    died, the bird flew out of it. I don’t see it as my soul leaving, but more as
    myself being freed from life.”

    say: lay down please! Most of the time it is first a cup of coffee to settle the
    nerves and create a soft atmosphere. Then she asks if I am ready. I will take
    my place on the couch. She will once again ask if I am sure, and she will start
    up the procedure and wish me a good journey. Or, in my case, a nice nap, because
    I hate it if people say, ‘Safe journey.’ I’m not going anywhere.”'

    by physicians, by psychiatrists, when previously it was the ultimate last resort,”
    Stef Groenewoud, a healthcare ethicist at Theological University Kampen, in the
    Netherlands, told me. “I see the phenomenon especially in people with psychiatric
    diseases, and especially young people with psychiatric disorders, where the healthcare
    professional seems to give up on them more easily than before.”

    “I entered the review committee in 2005, and I was there until 2014,” Boer told
    me. “In those years, I saw the Dutch euthanasia practice evolve from death being
    a last resort to death being a default option.” He ultimately resigned.

    be free to kill ourselves whenever our lives are “complete.”
