- en: In 1978, Michael Moorcock released a famous essay known as [Epic Pooh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Pooh).
    In it, he mocks Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, Richard Adams and other
    famous fantasy authors by comparing their work to [Winnie-the-Pooh](https://www.amazon.com/Winnie-Pooh-Classic-Milne/dp/151076917X/ref=sr_1_3?tag=mythcreants-20).
    Moorcock even updated the essay in 2008, suggesting his mind has not changed.

    and similar claims to his are still employed today. That gives us a lot to analyze
    already, but Moorcock’s own work adds another twist. Does Moorcock live up to
    his own standards? Is his work better than The Lord of the Rings, or is Moorcock
    just deriding his competitors? For answers to these questions, I’ve turned to
    one of his most famous works, [Elric of Melniboné](https://www.amazon.com/Elric-Melnibon%C3%A9-Saga-Part-ebook/dp/B08VJLT6RS/ref=sr_1_2?tag=mythcreants-20).
