    for mathematicians, but generally speaking they’re geometric shapes that are made
    up of smaller structures that themselves resemble the whole. In practice, that
    means that if you zoom in on part of a fractal, you’ll see a similar structure
    – and if you zoom in on part of that part, you’ll see a similar structure, and
    so on essentially into infinity.'

    and river networks. Molecules might seem like a prime place you’d expect to find
    them, since they can arrange themselves into all kinds of intriguing shapes, but
    among all the existing catalogs of molecules, there has never been a regular fractal
    (those that match almost exactly across scales).

    found the first regular molecular fractal. It’s an enzyme used by a species of
    cyanobacteria to produce citrate, which was found to naturally assemble itself
    into a specific fractal pattern called the [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).

    triangle from the center, so you have three smaller triangles that make up one
    larger triangle, with a triangular void in the center (a [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforce)
    that may look familiar to fans of *The Legend of Zelda*). Then punch out an inverted
    triangle from each of the smaller solid triangles, so you’ve got three of the
    second shape, or nine of the original shape, making up a larger triangle. You
    could potentially keep doing this forever, with each smaller triangle – and that’s
    the Sierpiński triangle fractal pattern.

    what we saw when we first took images of it using an electron microscope,” said
    Franziska Sendker, first author of the study. “The protein makes these beautiful
    triangles and as the fractal grows, we see these larger and larger triangular
    voids in the middle of them, which is totally unlike any protein assembly we’ve
    ever seen before.”

    used electron microscopy to analyze it in more detail, and found that its self-assembly
    wasn’t symmetrical. Different protein chains were found to make slightly different
    interactions at various positions in the fractal, forming the striking structure.

    biology? To find out, the team genetically altered the microbe so that the protein
    didn’t form the fractal structure, but the bacterium was still able to produce
    citrate just fine.

    structure is relatively easy to evolve, so it just happens by chance, and doesn’t
    need to have a specific purpose. They used an ancestral sequence reconstruction
    technique to trace back its possible evolution over millions of years, then biochemically
    produced those ancient proteins.'

    quickly, after only a few mutations. But it was soon lost in other cyanobacteria
    lineages, until it remained only in the one species it was recently found in.

    the past, this particular case does have all the trappings of a seemingly complex
    biological structure that just popped into existence for no good reason at all
    because it was simply very easy to evolve,” said Georg Hochberg, senior author
    of the study.

    meaning in something that almost feels artificial, but on the plus side, it does
    suggest that there may be many more molecular fractals waiting to be discovered.
