    was made a recommendation in December ‘96, it barely addressed layout at all.
    All it did was divorce HTML’s *existing* abilities from the tags they were attached
    to. We had font colors and backgrounds *because* `<FONT COLOR>` and `<BODY BACKGROUND>`
    existed. The only feature that even remotely affected where things were positioned
    was the `float` property, the equivalent to `<IMG ALIGN>`, which pulled an image
    to the side and let text flow around it, like in a magazine article. Hardly whelming.

    tables, and the table properties were too complicated to generalize in CSS and
    too entangled with the tag structure, so there was nothing for CSS 1 to inherit.
    It merely reduced the repetition in what we were already doing with e.g. `<FONT>`
    tags — making Web design less tedious, less error-prone, less full of noise, and
    much more maintainable. A pretty good step forward, and everyone happily adopted
    it for that, but tables remained king for arranging your page.

    an ugly horizontal scrollbar, so you have to do some goofy math to fix that as

    own ass — even explicitly rejecting proposed enhancements to HTML, in favor of
    snorting XML — some folks from (active) browser vendors Apple, Mozilla, and Opera
    decided to make their own clubhouse. WHATWG came into existence in June 2004,
    and they began work on HTML5. (It would end up defining error-handling very explicitly,
    which completely obviated the need for XHTML and eliminated a number of security
    concerns when working with arbitrary HTML. Also it gave us some new goodies, like
    native audio, video, and form controls for dates and colors and other stuff that
    had been clumsily handled by JavaScript-powered custom controls. And, um, still
    often are.)

    Sass. There’s a [painting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API)

    which seems cool and might even let you implement HTML tables entirely in CSS,

    do this is… [`:has()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)!
    Unfortunately, it’s only allowed when querying from JavaScript, not in a live
    stylesheet, and nothing implements it anyway. 20 years and I’m still waiting for
    a way to style checkbox labels.

    CSS rules only apply to other elements within its immediate parent, meaning you
    could drop in arbitrary (possibly user-written) CSS without any risk of affecting
    the rest of the page. Alas, this was quietly dropped some time ago, with shadow
    DOM suggested as a wildly inappropriate replacement.'

    they were templates you could use to reduce duplication in pure HTML? But I can’t
    find any trace of that concept now, and the current implementations require JavaScript
    to define them, so there’s nothing declarative linking a new tag to its implementation.
    Which makes them completely unusable for anything that doesn’t have a compelling
    reason to rely on JS. Alas.

    including [on your phone](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/), unless
    for some reason you use an iPhone, which forbids other browser engines, which
    is far worse than anything Microsoft ever did, but we just kinda accept it for
    some reason.
