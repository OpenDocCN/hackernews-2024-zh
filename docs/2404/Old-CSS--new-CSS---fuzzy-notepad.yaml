    to stacking everything in one big column. You could put all the thumbnails inline,

    quirk, perhaps the second most infamous one: if a table cell contains only a single
    image, the space under the baseline is removed. Under normal CSS rules, the image
    is sitting within a line of (otherwise empty) text, which requires some space
    reserved underneath for descenders — the tails on letters like y. Early browsers
    didn’t handle this correctly, and some otherwise strict-mode websites from circa
    2000 rely on it — e.g., by cutting up a large image and arranging the chunks in

    own de facto standard. Web designers who cared about this sort of thing (and to

    the browser is concerned, the “cursor” is still at the top. So now you need to
    use `clear`, which bumps an element down below all floats, to fix that. And if
    you made the sidebar 20% wide and the body 80% wide, then any margin between them
    would add to that 100%, making the page wider than the viewport, so now you have
    an ugly horizontal scrollbar, so you have to do some goofy math to fix that as
    well. If you have borders or backgrounds on either part, then it was a little
    conspicuous that they were different heights, so now you have to do some *truly*
    grotesque stuff to fix *that*. And the more conscientious authors noticed that
    screenreaders would read the entire sidebar before getting to the body text, which
    is a pretty rude thing to subject blind visitors to, so they came up with yet

    a similar miracle. Not only did it paper over the differences between IE’s “JScript”

    have solved all our problems. I’m vaguely aware of some work being done on more
    extensive math support, and possibly some functions for altering colors like in
    Sass. There’s a [painting API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API)
    that lets you generate backgrounds on the fly with JavaScript using the canvas
    API, which is… quite something. Apparently it’s now in spec that you can use [`attr()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr)
    (which evaluates to the value of an HTML attribute) as the value for any property,
    which seems cool and might even let you implement HTML tables entirely in CSS,
    but you could do the same thing with variables. I mean, um, custom properties.
    I’m more excited about [`:is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is),
    which matches any of a list of selectors, and [subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid),
    which lets you add some nesting to a grid but keep grandchildren still aligned
