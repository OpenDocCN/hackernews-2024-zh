    in the *Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus* clade. Therefore, the L residue was either
    gained once and then lost along the lineage to *Cyanobium/Prochlorococcus* or
    it was gained convergently twice in *Planktothrix* and *S.* *elongatus*. We therefore
    added the CS sequence from the cyanobacterium *Prochlorothrix hollandica* to the

    The gasket was filled with 19 µl buffer (PBS or 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl pH 7.5)
    to focus the instrument. Then, 1 µl of prediluted protein solution (1 µM) was

    proteins during measurement was 50 nM unless stated otherwise. Data were acquired
    for 60 s at 100 frames per s using AcquireMP (Refeyn, v.1.2.1). The resulting
    movies were processed and analysed using DiscoverMP (Refeyn, v.2.5.0). The identified
    protein complexes with corresponding molecular weight were plotted as histograms,
    and the individual oligomeric state populations appeared as peaks that were fitted
    by a Gaussian curve (implemented in DiscoverMP). All complexes within the respective
    Gaussian curve were used to calculate the fraction of CS subunits in each oligomeric
    state. The instrument was calibrated at least once during each measuring session
    using either a commercial standard (NativeMark unstained protein standard, Thermo
    Fisher) or a homemade calibration standard of a protein with known sizes of complexes.

    image processing. eLife 7, e35383 (2018).")). The following number of particles
    were averaged: 1,491 particles for 18mers; 200 particles for 54mers; and 186 for
    36mers. The 36mer and 54mer particles were isolated from an extended dataset,
    in which we specifically looked for larger assemblies. The exact percentage of
    complexes larger than 18mers was difficult to estimate because of very strong
    preferential orientation. Most particles seemed to have landed not on the face
    of the triangle but on one of its edges or even one of its tips (Extended Data
    Fig. [1](/articles/s41586-024-07287-2#Fig6)). To obtain an estimate, another dataset
    of 150 micrographs without a bias towards larger assemblies was collected. All
    particles were manually counted for these micrographs and included the assemblies
    that were laying on their edge and appeared as rectangles. By measuring the edge
    length, we could assign them to be either a 36mers (30 nm) or 54mers (40 nm).
    The analysis revealed that under negative-stain TEM conditions (450 nM) approximately
    92.8% of detected assemblies were identified as 18mers (1,773 particles), 3.5%
    as 36mers (66 particles) and 3.8% as 54mers (72 particles). Our estimate of the
    abundance should still be taken with care and by comparison with our SAXS data,
    which showed that large complexes only start being reasonably common above 25 µM
    protein concentration. For the H369R variant of SeCS, a protein concentration
    of 450 nM was used and 136 particles were averaged to produce the 2D class average
    of the 18mer shown in Extended Data Fig. [6d](/articles/s41586-024-07287-2#Fig11).'
