- en: We’re thrilled to announce that [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/ssh) is
    now Generally Available. Tailscale SSH allows Tailscale to manage the authentication
    and authorization of SSH connections on your tailnet. From the user’s perspective,
    you use SSH as normal—authenticating with Tailscale according to configurable
    rules—and we handle SSO, MFA, and key rotation, and allow you to enforce precise
    permissions in ACLs. Combined with other enterprise features like user and group
    provisioning with SCIM, you can use Tailscale SSH to craft a fully zero-trust
    remote access solution.

    already become a key component of many of our users’ workflows, including as a
    foundational piece of enterprise ZTNA strategies. With no additional hardware
    or firewall rules to manage, it’s basically a drop-in upgrade for ubiquitous—and
    sometimes somewhat fiddly—SSH processes.
