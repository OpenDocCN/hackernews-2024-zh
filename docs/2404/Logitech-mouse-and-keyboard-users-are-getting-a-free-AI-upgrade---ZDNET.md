[Generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) assistants have become so widely used that shortcuts to access these tools are being physically integrated into [many new laptop keyboards](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-adding-a-new-copilot-key-to-your-windows-pc/). Logitech has taken a different approach, placing a shortcut to access [ChatGPT](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-chatgpt-and-why-does-it-matter-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) in its keyboards and mice without adding a new physical key.

On Wednesday, Logitech unveiled its new Logi AI Prompt Builder, a software window that lets users access the chatbot's assistance without interrupting their workflow. The company also launched a new [Signature AI Edition of the M750 mouse](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/159047/499820/8585?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fsignature-ai-edition-m750-wireless-mouse.910-007396.html&subId1=subid_value).

Within the Logi + Option app, users can now access the Low AI Prompt Builder for free and create a shortcut key on their mouse or keyboard that automatically opens the Logi AI Prompt Builder software window when ChatGPT is needed.

The window suggests queries based on the text that users selected to work with, according to pre-defined recipes of common queries, such as Rephrase or Summarize, Logitech explained. In addition to helping users get easier access to ChatGPT by circumventing having to copy and paste text into a browser manually, the Low AI Prompt Builder also makes prompt writing easier with its pre-determined "recipes" and customization dropdowns.

Users can also customize queries, including through options to change tone, length, and style, as seen above.  

"New Logi AI Prompt Builder is a shortcut to AI fluency for anyone with a Logitech mouse or keyboard compatible with Logi Options+ software who wants easily to access AI's limitless potential," Delphine Donné, Logitech's general manager of personal workspace solutions, said in a statement.

Users can access Logi AI Prompt Builder today for free, as long as they are using a Logitech keyboard or mouse supported by the English version of the Logi + Option app. That includes some of the company's most popular product lines, like the Logitech MX, Ergo, Signature, and Studio Series, according to the press release.

In short, the free software converts the users' keyboard or mouse into a tool with a shortcut to access ChatGPT without upgrading the hardware. If you are looking to upgrade your mouse, Logitech is pushing the Logitech [Signature AI Edition Mouse](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/159047/499820/8585?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fsignature-ai-edition-m750-wireless-mouse.910-007396.html&subId1=subid_value).

This new mouse has an AI prompt button that offers a shortcut to the Logi AI Prompt Builder. Logitech says the mouse is available for preorder today and will be available "this month" on the Logitech website in the US for $50 and in the UK.
