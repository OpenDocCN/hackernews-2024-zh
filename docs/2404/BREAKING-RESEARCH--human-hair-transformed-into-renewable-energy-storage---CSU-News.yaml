    [Dr Amandeep Singh Pannu,](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/persons/amandeep-singh-pannu)
    working with [Professor Muhammad J A Shiddiky](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/persons/muhammad-johirul-alam-shiddiky),
    has discovered how to turn human hair into graphite to then be used in lithium-ion
    batteries.

    and hence there is an urgent need to manufacture high-energy density storage materials
    in a sustainable manner.

    and its production is concentrated in a few countries, causing the material to
    suffer from supply chain and geo-political issues which affect the whole energy
    storage industry down-stream.”*'

    and locally in Australia, will hugely benefit our national energy sector.

- en: Additionally, as the demand for electric and hybrid vehicles increases, the
    need for lithium-ion batteries follows. However, Dr Singh said producing graphite
    to be used in these batteries can be polluting, requiring harsh chemicals, such
    as Hydrofluoric acid (HF).

    the active material is ingeniously derived from discarded strands of human hair,”
