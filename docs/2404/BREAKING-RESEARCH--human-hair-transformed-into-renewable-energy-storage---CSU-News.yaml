    [Dr Amandeep Singh Pannu,](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/persons/amandeep-singh-pannu)
    working with [Professor Muhammad J A Shiddiky](https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/persons/muhammad-johirul-alam-shiddiky),
    has discovered how to turn human hair into graphite to then be used in lithium-ion
    batteries.

    need for lithium-ion batteries follows. However, Dr Singh said producing graphite
    to be used in these batteries can be polluting, requiring harsh chemicals, such
    as Hydrofluoric acid (HF).
