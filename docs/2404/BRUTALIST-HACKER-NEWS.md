### About

This site is an experiment with [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/ "A popular page about brutalist web design"), [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/), and more broadly what can be built with only [open web standards](https://www.w3schools.com/). It is built with one HTML/CSS/JS file without any libraries, and the Hacker News API. As such is is also a good playground for students learning web development. This page is also an exploration of glitch art, cyberpunk, and brutalist trends in web design. Acknowledgements to the [original Hacker News website](https://news.ycombinator.com/ "The original Hacker News website") for their API and [Matt Gross](https://codepen.io/mattgrosswork/pen/VwprebG) for the glitch animation used in the title bar.

You can contribute to the development of this page or give a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/wkyleg/brutalist-hacker-news/blob/main/themes.md "The git repository for this website"). New themes are welcomed! If you have a theme you'd like to see on this page, please submit a pull request or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
