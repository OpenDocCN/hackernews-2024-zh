    it's not as sad as collecting stamps! It is? Really? Oh well, never mind. Anyway,
    my [recent piece](https://www.theregister.com/2007/12/19/quattro_pro_fcuk/) about
    Borland putting rude words in Quattro Pro got me thinking it was time to revisit
    that collection.

    delightful but unverified "Shut her down, Clancy, she's a-pumping mud." Whatever
    its original provenance, within six months, it had moved into reality - a friend
    saw it on the list and actually added it to a real hole in the wall system. As
    far as I know it's still in there. A case of art imitating life, or the other
    way around...or science, or whatever.

    find. There are hundreds of the wretched things; at least give me a clue. What
    letter does it start with? That would narrow it down. And Microsoft wonders why
    people end up shouting at Windows.

    a part of the error message was actually written to the screen. What was that
