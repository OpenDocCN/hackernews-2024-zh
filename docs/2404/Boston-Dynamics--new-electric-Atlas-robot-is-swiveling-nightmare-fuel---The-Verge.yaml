- en: It’s alive! A day after announcing it was [retiring Atlas, its hydraulic robot](/24132451/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-retirement),
    Boston Dynamics has introduced [a new, all-electric version](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/)
    of its humanoid machine. The next-generation Atlas robot is designed to offer
    a far greater range of movement than its predecessor.

- en: Boston Dynamics wanted the new version to show that Atlas can keep a humanoid
    form without limiting “how a bipedal robot can move.” The new version has been
    redesigned with swiveling joints that the company claims make it “uniquely capable
    of tackling dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.”

- en: “We designed the electric version of Atlas to be stronger, more dexterous, and
    more agile,” the company said in its press release. “Atlas may resemble a human
    form factor, but we are equipping the robot to move in the most efficient way
    possible to complete a task, rather than being constrained by a human range of
    motion. Atlas will move in ways that exceed human capabilities.”

- en: The teaser showcasing the new robot’s capabilities is as unnerving as it is
    theatrical. [The video](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D29ECwExc-_M)
    starts with Atlas lying in a cadaver-like fashion on the floor before it swiftly
    folds its legs backward over its body and rises to a standing position in a manner
    befitting some kind of Cronenberg body-horror flick. Its curved, illuminated head
    does add some Pixar lamp-like charm, but the way Atlas then spins at the waist
    and marches toward the camera really feels rather jarring.

- en: The design itself is also a little more humanoid. Similar to bipedal robots
    like [Tesla’s Optimus](/2023/12/13/23999559/teslas-new-optimus-gen-2-robot), the
    new Atlas now has longer limbs, a straighter back, and a distinct “head” that
    can swivel around as needed. There are no cables in sight, and its “face” includes
    a built-in ring light. It is a marked improvement on its predecessor and now features
    a bunch of Boston Dynamics’ new AI and machine learning tools.

- en: The company also said it’s continuing to build on capabilities already achieved
    with the last generation hydraulic Atlas model, such as lifting and maneuvering
    objects, alongside exploring “several new gripper variations” to ready the robot
    for a range of different industry environments.

- en: Boston Dynamics said the new Atlas will be tested with a small group of customers
    “over the next few years,” starting with Hyundai. Other humanoid robots from rival
    providers like [Figure](/2024/1/18/24043065/bmw-figure-robotics-humanoid-robot-workers-deployment)
    and [Apptronik](/2024/3/15/24101791/mercedes-robot-humanoid-apptronik-apollo-manufacturing)
    are similarly being tested on production lines for BMW and Mercedes, respectively.
