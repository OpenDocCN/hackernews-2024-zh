- en: As video continues to evolve, the demand for new technology to handle its complexity
    is growing. With the arrival of 4K video, for example, developers quickly became
    aware that existing video codecs like H264 were no longer going to cut it. To
    that extent, AV1 has started to become the popular standard for decoding and encoding
    on devices. Now, Google is ready to adapt to the changing times, and it will soon
    be reflected on [YouTube](https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-1080p-enhanced-bitrate-web-rollout/).

    who is a part of the Android Video and Image Codecs team at Google, recently [announced
    on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7186235577493544960)
    that Android will now use an AV1 decoder known as “libdav1d,” which was created
    by the team behind VLC. As specified, all devices dating back to Android 12 will
    have native software support for the codec once they''ve received the March 2024
    [Google Play System Update](https://www.androidpolice.com/check-for-google-play-system-updates-manually-again/).'

- en: While the update will bring improved AV1 codec support to a huge number of Android
    phones, it doesn't activate the new codec by default — instead, the existing AV1
    decoder, libgav1, is used, unless an app specifically requests to use the newer
    dav1d decoder to process video. That's exactly what YouTube started doing immediately
    after this rollout began, and it's causing controversy among some Android users.

- en: One of the key benefits of the codec is that it helps maintain video quality
    during compression and decoding, so many users are excited about the potential
    for higher quality AV1 video. However, not everyone is happy with the change —
    particularly those with older devices and midrange phones. It's mostly newer higher-end
    phones that have hardware decoding support for AV1, so those with midrange devices
    and older flagships may have to rely on software decoding now that YouTube has
    opted in to the libdav1d decoder. Many of these Android users [have expressed
    concern](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1c7i24z/youtube_is_now_forcing_av1_on_every_device/)
    over how the change will impact their battery life if it means a move away from
    hardware-accelerated decoding.

- en: While there are valid reasons to be concerned, it’s worth noting that Google
    isn’t the first to bring about such a change to a widely used service like YouTube.
    Back in 2020, Netflix did something similar for its Android app users, [making
    AV1 its new standard](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/02/05/netflix-for-android-adopts-av1-video-codec-currently-limited-to-save-data-mode/).
    Prior to this change, Netflix confirmed that it had been using VP6 codec for its
    Android app. With the upgrade, it started to allow subscribers to stream content
    and also enabled the “Save data” feature while leveraging mobile service. It doesn’t
    seem like there was as much uproar over Netflix’s move compared to what Android
    users are currently saying — perhaps time will ease the worries that emerged with
    Google’s recent news.
