- en: Charge Robotics is a YC-backed startup building robots that build large-scale
    solar farms. Demand for new solar projects is booming (1/5th of all the solar
    that exists in the US was installed last year!), but today‚Äôs construction companies
    can‚Äôt keep up due to limited labor resources.
