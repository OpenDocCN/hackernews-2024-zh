    of its Federal Police yesterday both called for social networks to offer more
    assistance to help their investigators work on cases involving terrorism, child
    exploitation, and racist nationalism.

    and Intelligence Organisation, who opened by saying “The internet is a transformative
    information source… *and* the world’s most potent incubator of extremism.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As he [outlined an argument](https://www.asio.gov.au/director-generals-national-press-club-address)
    that a dynamic tension exists between security and technology, Burgess added “encryption
    protects our privacy and enables our economy…*and* creates safe spaces for violent
    extremists to operate, network and recruit.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Burgess labelled encryption “clearly a good thing, a positive for our democracy
    and our economy” because it “protects privacy, it enables communications and transactions.”

    has laws that make it possible to access encrypted messages. Burgess said those
    laws aren’t working well because tech companies aren’t helping.

    we cannot actually read it without the assistance of the company that owns and
    operates the app,” he said. “The company has to be willing and able to give effect
    to our warrant.”

    encryption.

    the existing powers and to uphold existing laws,” he said.

    is unaccountable,” Burgess argued. “In effect, unaccountable encryption is like
    building a safe room for terrorists and spies, a secure place where they can plot
    and plan.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He argued the case for “accountable encryption” by telling the story of a recent
    operation involving an Australian who shared extremist content online and was
    suspected of having contacted terrorists to discuss plans for a violent act. Burgess
    said that after a “difficult, dangerous, time-consuming and resource-intensive”
    operation that involved “surveillance, human intelligence and other capabilities,”
    ASIO determined the individual “possessed the intent and capability to conduct
    an attack.”

    more quickly and easily reached that conclusion.

    between life and death,” Burgess argued.

    made by 32 European police chiefs in which they expressed “deep concern that end-to-end
    encryption is being rolled out in a way that undermines their ability to investigate
    crime and keep the public safe.”

    the context of investigations into child exploitation.

    crime has been committed, and it is necessary for law enforcement to access information
    to investigate that serious crime, tech companies should respect the rule of law
    and the order of a court, or independent judicial authority, and provide that
    information,” Kershaw said.

    and Mark Zuckerberg,” the police boss said. “I know we can find common ground
    because, put simply, tech is supposed to make our lives easier and safer, and
    not the opposite.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    [arguing](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/23/australia_x_terror_video_takedown/)
    against an Australian law that requires the takedown of a video depicting an act
    of terror. Several associates of the alleged offender depicted in that video were
    [arrested on Wednesday](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/seven-arrested-following-joint-counter-terrorism-team-operation)
    as it was felt they share a violent ideology and therefore represent an unacceptable
    risk to the Australian community.

    opportunity, and threat”
  prefs: []

    claimed by tech-evangelists and marketing gurus. A lot of what they call AI isn’t,”
    Burgess said, before predicting AI presents an opportunity to “deliver dividends
    to every part of society, from the economy to health care.”

    use it to threaten Australia’s security” and said some nasty people are already
    using AI for evil.

    AI program for advice on building weapons and attack planning,” Burgess said.

    and “will increase the volume of espionage” as it gives nation-states a good reason
    “to harvest personal data to assist their own programming and more motivated to
    steal information about rival AI technologies.”
