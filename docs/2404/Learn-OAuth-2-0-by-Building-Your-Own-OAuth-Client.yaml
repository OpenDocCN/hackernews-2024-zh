- en: You've built an OAuth client using the authorization code grant type. However,
    should you develop your own OAuth client from scratch? Generally, no. Subtle bugs
    or novel exploits can introduce serious security risks. Instead, opting for well-tested,
    open-source OAuth clients is a safer choice.

- en: Understanding the inner workings of an OAuth client is important. It gives you
    knowledge about the configuration options available in open-source libraries,
    helps in troubleshooting OAuth-related issues, and makes learning other OAuth
    flows like refresh, PKCE, and implicit a breeze. You're also in a great position
    to learn about OpenID Connect (OIDC); a protocol built atop of OAuth.

    the minimal code adjustments needed to support it. Stay tuned!
