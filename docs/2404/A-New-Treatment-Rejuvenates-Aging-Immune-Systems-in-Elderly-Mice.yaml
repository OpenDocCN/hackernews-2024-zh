    release protein “markers” to attract immune cell types to a target. Together,
    they’re a formidable force that fights off biological threats—both pathogens from
    outside the body and cancer or senescent “zombie” cells from within.

    inflammation that wreaks havoc in the brain and body. These cells increase the
    risk of dementia, heart disease, and gradually sap muscles. Other units that battle
    novel pathogens—such as a new strain of flu—slowly dwindle, making it harder to
    ward off infections.

    published in *Nature*, scientists say they restored the balance between the units
    in aged mice, reverting their immune systems back to a youthful state. Using an
    antibody, the team targeted a subpopulation of stem cells that eventually develops
    into the immune cells underlying chronic inflammation. The antibodies latched
    onto targets and rallied other immune cells to wipe them out.

    of California, San Diego, who were not involved in the study. The intervention
    “could thus have an outsized impact on enhancing immunity, reducing the incidence
    and severity of chronic inflammatory diseases and preventing blood disorders.”

    killer T cells that—true to their name—directly destroy cancerous cells and infections.

    those that literally eat their foes. These cells form the innate immune unit,
    which is present at birth and the first line of defense throughout our lifetime.

- en: Unlike their adaptive comrades, which more precisely target invaders, the innate
    unit uses a “burn it all” strategy to fight off infections by increasing local
    inflammation. It’s a double-edged sword. While useful in youth, with age the unit
    becomes dominant, causing chronic inflammation that gradually damages the body.

    others are biased towards the innate unit. With age, the latter [gradually take
    over](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0503280102), increasing chronic
    inflammation while lowering protection against new pathogens. This is, in part,
    why elderly people are advised to get new flu shots, and why they were first in

    that dot their surfaces. A subset of the cells, dubbed my-HSCs, are more likely
    to produce cells in the innate immune system, which triggers chronic inflammation
    with age.

    found three protein markers they could use to identify and target my-HSCs cells
    in aged mice. They then engineered an antibody to target the cells for elimination.

    long, wrote Kasu and Signer. A single injection reduced the troublesome stem cells
    for at least two months—roughly a twelfth of a mouse’s lifespan. With my-HSCs
    no longer dominant, healthy blood stem cells gained ground inside the bone marrow.
    For at least four months, the treated mice produced more cells in the adaptive
    immune unit than their similarly aged peers, while having less overall inflammation.

    received the vaccine. Those treated with the antibody mounted a larger protective
    immune response. When given a dose of the virus, their immune systems rapidly
    recruited adaptive immune cells, and fought off the infection—whereas those receiving
    only the vaccine struggled.

    infections.

    into their neighborhood. By cleaning up the source, the antibody could have also
    changed the environment the cells live in, so they are better able to thrive during

    Reviving immune function could restore the surveillance systems needed to eliminate

    before testing in people. As a next step, they’re looking to expand the therapy
    to tackle other disorders related to a malfunctioning immune system.
