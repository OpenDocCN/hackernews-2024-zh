    ship North Star—CEO John Lansing—about the lack of viewpoint diversity and asked
    if we could have a conversation about it. I got no response, so I followed up
    four days later. He said he would appreciate hearing my perspective and copied
    his assistant to set up a meeting. On December 15, the morning of the meeting,
    Lansing’s assistant wrote back to cancel our conversation because he was under
    the weather. She said he was looking forward to chatting and a new meeting invitation
    would be sent. But it never came.

    a demanding job with lots of constituents and headaches to deal with. But what’s
    indisputable is that no one in a C-suite or upper management position has chosen
    to deal with the lack of viewpoint diversity at NPR and how that affects our journalism.

    audience in recent years has become less diverse, not more so. Back in 2011, our
    audience leaned a bit to the left but roughly reflected America politically; now,
    the audience is cramped into a smaller, progressive silo.

    blacks and Hispanics, the numbers have barely budged. In 2023, according to our
    demographic research, 6 percent of our news audience was black, far short of the
    overall U.S. adult population, which is 14.4 percent black. And Hispanics were
    only 7 percent, compared to the overall Hispanic adult population, around 19 percent.
    Our news audience doesn’t come close to reflecting America. It’s overwhelmingly
    white and progressive, and clustered around coastal cities and college towns.

    bought out [10 percent](https://www.npr.org/2023/02/22/1158710498/npr-layoffs-2023)
    of its staff and [canceled four podcasts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/03/23/npr-cuts-layoffs-podcast-invisibilia/)
    following a slump in advertising revenue. Our [radio](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/public-broadcasting/)
    audience is dwindling and our [podcast](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/audio-and-podcasting/)
    downloads are down from 2020\. The digital stories on our website rarely have
    national impact. They aren’t conversation starters. Our competitive advantage
    in audio—where for years NPR had no peer—is vanishing. There are plenty of informative
    and entertaining podcasts to choose from.

    we had a higher trustworthy score than CNN or *The New York Times*. But the research
    from Harris Poll is hardly reassuring. It found that “3-in-10 audience members
    familiar with NPR said they associate NPR with the characteristic ‘trustworthy.’ ”
    Only in a world where media credibility has completely imploded would a 3-in-10
    trustworthy score be something to boast about.

    less diverse over time, the trajectory for NPR is not promising. Two paths seem
    clear. We can keep doing what we’re doing, hoping it will all work out. Or we
    could start over, with the basic building blocks of journalism. We could face
    up to where we’ve gone wrong. News organizations don’t go in for that kind of
    reckoning. But there’s a good reason for NPR to be the first: we’re the ones with
    the word *public* in our name.'

    more fractured, there’s still a need for a public institution where stories are
    told and viewpoints exchanged in good faith. Defunding, as a rebuke from Congress,
    wouldn’t change the journalism at NPR. That needs to come from within.

    Katherine Maher, who’s been a leader in tech. She doesn’t have a news background,
    which could be an asset given where things stand. I’ll be rooting for her. It’s
    a tough job. Her first rule could be simple enough: don’t tell people how to think.
    It could even be the new North Star.'
