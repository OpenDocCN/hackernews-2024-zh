- en: In December of last year, single mom Courtney Peterson was laid off from her
    job working for a now-shuttered inpatient transitional living program. Aside from
    giving her the ability to bring her 7-year-old son to work, the job also paid
    enough to cover rent in a studio apartment in the Van Nuys neighborhood in Los
    Angeles, where they had lived for a year and a half.

    January's rent and began researching potential avenues for help. When her son
    was an infant, they lived in a travel trailer, she said, a situation she did not
    want to return to.

    rent assistance," Peterson told CNBC. "But a lot of them wanted me to have active
    eviction notices in order to give me assistance. I felt like I was running out
    of options. I''d reached out to pretty much everyone I could possibly think of
    with no luck."'

    Prevention Unit within the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, offering
    a lifeline. The pilot program uses predictive artificial intelligence to identify
    individuals and families at risk of becoming homeless, offering aid to help them
    get stabilized and remain housed.

    30 percent since 2007, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban
    Development. A report from the California State Auditor's Office found that the
    state spent $24 billion on homelessness from 2018 through 2023.

    and families at risk of becoming homeless, with 86 percent of participants retaining
    permanent housing when they leave, according to Dana Vanderford, associate director
    of homelessness prevention at the county's Department of Health Services.

    with the majority of the funding for the program coming from the American Rescue
    Plan Act. Tracking individuals down to help and convincing them that the offer
    is real and not a scam can be a challenge, but once contact is established, aid
    is quickly put into motion.

    they''ve had a medical emergency. The timing with which we meet people feels critical,"
    Vanderford said. "Our ability to appear out of nowhere, cold-call a person, provide
    them with resources and prevent that imminent loss of housing for 86 percent of
    the people that we''ve worked with feels remarkable."'

    and basic needs, allowing her to stay put in her apartment while she looks for
    a new job. The program works with clients for four months and then follows up
    with them at the six-month mark and the 12-month mark, as well as 18 months after
    discharge. Caseworkers like Amber Lung, who helped Peterson, say they can see
    how important preventive work is firsthand.

    to get back to [being] housed, and so if we can fill in just a little bit of a
    gap there might be to help them retain that housing, I think it''s much easier
    to stabilize things than if folks end up in a shelter or on the streets to get
    them back into that position," Lung said.'

- en: The AI model was developed by the California Policy Lab at UCLA over the course
    of several years, using data provided by Los Angeles County's Chief Information
    Office, or CIO. The CIO integrated data from seven different county departments,
    de-identified for privacy, including emergency room visits, behavioral health
    care and large public benefits programs from food stamps to income support and
    homeless services, according to Janey Rountree, executive director of the California
    Policy Lab. The program also pulled data from the criminal justice system.

    used it to attempt to make predictions about the future, creating an anonymized
    list of individuals ranked from highest risk to lowest. The lab provided the list
    to the county so it could reach out to people who may be at risk of losing housing
    before it happened.

    has found that anonymized data can be traced back to individuals based on demographic
    information. A sweeping study on data privacy, based on 1990 U.S. Census data,
    found that 87% of Americans could be identified using ZIP code, birth date and
    gender.

    cost of housing is going up, increasingly, and that is the cause of our people
    experiencing homelessness," Rountree said. "The biggest misperception is that
    homelessness is caused by individual risk factors, when in fact it''s very clear
    that the root cause of this is a structural economic issue."'

    homelessness, to test and innovate around prevention," she said. "It''s a relatively

    one way to do that."'
