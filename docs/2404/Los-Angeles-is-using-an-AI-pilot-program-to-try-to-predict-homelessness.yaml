    job working for a now-shuttered inpatient transitional living program. Aside from
    giving her the ability to bring her 7-year-old son to work, the job also paid
    enough to cover rent in a studio apartment in the Van Nuys neighborhood in Los
    Angeles, where they had lived for a year and a half.

    a new job. The program works with clients for four months and then follows up
