- en: Roku already [serves ads](https://www.engadget.com/roku-shoppable-ads-walmart-113552825.html)
    through its platform, but it's also apparently exploring the idea of showing you
    ads while you're using third-party devices connected to its TVs. Based on a recent
    [patent filing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230388589A1/en) unearthed
    by [*Lowpass*](https://www.lowpass.cc/p/roku-hdmi-ad-insertion-patent), the company
    is looking to develop a system or a method "for ad insertion by a display device
    coupled to a media device via a high-definition media interface (HDMI) connection."
    That means if you've connected another streaming device or console — say, an Apple
    TV, a Chromecast or a PlayStation — to a Roku TV via HDMI, the company would still
    be able to serve you advertisements.

    watching or playing on the third-party device attached to it is on pause. In its
    patent, it described several methods on how it can detect whether the show or
    game on screen is paused, such as receiving a pause signal from the remote control,
    detecting a pause icon, looking at several video frames and determining that the
    image on screen hasn't changed for some time and getting a silent audio signal
    from the HDMI connection.

    (*much*), assuming you're truly stepping away or doing something else in the meantime.
    While you'd probably prefer those experiences to be free of ads altogether, Roku
    is at least looking to make sure that it's serving you relevant ads. It could
    analyze frozen video or audio frames and use automatic content recognition (ACR)
    technology to identify what's on screen. Or it could analyze metadata to show
    ads connected to what you're playing or watching. It could also serve commercials
    based on what third-party device is attached to your TV.

- en: As *Lowpass* notes, the company could have conjured the idea because manufacturers
    typically don't make a lot of money from hardware sales. For the fiscal year of
    2023, Roku lost $44 million on smart TVs. Similarly, Samsung's visual display
    and digital appliances division [posted $37.5 million in operating losses](https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-annual-profits-continued-to-decline-in-2023-090500640.html)
    for last year's fourth quarter. Meanwhile, ads and services generated $1.6 billion
    in profit for Roku. This idea could potentially make it more money... if the prospect
    of watching commercials while your show or game is paused doesn't turn you off
    buying Roku TV, of course. This is just a patent at this point in time, though,
    and Roku may very well end up scrapping it and not implementing it at all.

  zh: 正如*Lowpass*指出的，公司可能产生了这个想法，因为制造商通常从硬件销售中赚不了多少钱。对于2023财年，Roku在智能电视上亏损了$4400万。同样，三星的视觉显示和数字家电部门在去年第四季度[录得了3750万美元的营业亏损](https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-annual-profits-continued-to-decline-in-2023-090500640.html)。与此同时，广告和服务为Roku带来了16亿美元的利润。如果在观看Roku电视时，暂停节目或游戏时播放广告的前景不会让你感到反感，这个想法可能会为其带来更多利润。不过目前这只是一个专利，Roku很可能最终会放弃它，或者根本不实施它。
