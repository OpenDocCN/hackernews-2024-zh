# Reentry - An Orbital Simulator

## THE ACADEMY

Let's face it. Flying and operating a spacecraft is no simple task. Given the amount of subsystems, procedures and controls, the learning curve to even get the rocket off the pad in a safe and controlled manner can be hard. After ignition, the only way out of the capsule is through an abort. Thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed to produce enough thrust to bring the rocket through the initial layer of the atmosphere, where the dangers of maximun dynamic pressure are pushing the structural limits of the launch vehicle. The automatic guidance logic carefully guides the spacecraft into space. At the same time, the astronauts are busy monitoring the available data and completes checklists while the cockpit shakes violently.

Once in orbit, the next maneuvers are planned, while also constantly verifying that the essential systems needed to keep you alive are functional, and that you have a way of returning back to Earth.

Reentry - An Orbital Simulator uses realistic orbital mechanics, and every force applied to the spacecraft will affet its attitude and trajectory. Luckily, you don't have to learn it all at once to get started. The in-game Academy provides multiple lessons for each spacecraft available. Each lesson is focused on one or two procecures, and explain them at a basic level. Slowly you will be able to put the pieces together, and attempt to get certified in a given spacecraft by taking the exam.
