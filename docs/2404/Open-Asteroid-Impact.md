## 03Competitors

Sometimes investors and media ask us about how we compare to other asteroid mining startups. The short answer: We’re better. The longer answer: We’re *much* better. Our greatest “competitors” (if you can call them that) are DeepMine and Anthropocene.

DeepMine and Anthropocene are for-profit companies. That means their incentives are aligned with shareholder interests, rather than the good of humanity. Can you trust them?

Besides, DeepMine’s CEO, Dennis, is kind of a sketchy guy. Before working in tech, he was a poker player and novelist. He wrote three books: “How to Be God,” “If I had a kinetic weapon, here’s how I’d use it to take over the world” and “Evil Genius.” Is this the type of man you’d trust with the future of humanity?

Anthropocene is really skeevy. They used to work with us and then they just left and started a competitor that’s a for-profit? WTF? Basically Judas, except for rare earth metals rather than silver.

You should never trust unaccountable for-profit companies that are recklessly racing ahead without concern for human welfare, especially in such a dangerous domain.

This is why we’re moving as quickly as we can, so a responsible actor can be at the helm and set safety standards.

Even if by some miracle, for-profit companies manage to coordinate to be safer, we simply cannot trust nation-state actors. Like Russia. Russia has a space program. They can use it to redirect asteroids. If American companies like ourselves don’t step up and move as quickly as we can, a *Russian* asteroid might land first and kill your children. We must vigilantly guard against *Russian, Communist* Asteroids.

In this space, sometimes you hear about ideological movements like asteroid accelerationists (“a/accs”) and decelerationists (“decels” aka “doomers”). Their disagreements are complicated and esoteric. To simplify, decels believe we must be concerned with safety and slow down or even stop asteroid redirection progress, whereas a/accs believe that we should race forward and accelerate as quickly as possible and not mention safety at all. We have sympathies towards both movements, and consider ourselves to take the middle path. We race forward and accelerate as quickly as possible while mentioning safety.

We believe that powerful asteroid redirection equipment should be subject to rigorous safety evaluations. For example, Matthew Barnett, a senior independent evaluator, helped us develop our Massive Extraterrestrial Threat Robustness (METR) benchmark. Unfortunately we can only calculate how the impact energy of an asteroid scales with size. We are not able to estimate the direct destructive potential, making it hard to predict in advance how large an asteroid would need to be to wipe us all out. Our benchmark sheds light on this by dropping asteroids on the Earth and checking the damage. For more, check out the Responsible Slinging Policy (RSP) section.
