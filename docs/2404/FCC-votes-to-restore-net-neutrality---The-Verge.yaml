    reversing a repeal ushered through during the Trump administration.

- en: Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) should not
    be able to discriminate against different kinds of content by blocking or throttling
    connection speeds or offering paid prioritization for different internet traffic.
    The FCC has sought to accomplish this by reclassifying ISPs as common carriers
    under Title II of the Communications Act, giving the agency more regulatory authority
    over them.

- en: Democratic FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in remarks ahead of the vote that
    internet access went from a “nice to have, to need to have.” She added, “Broadband
    is now an essential service. Essential services, the ones we count on in every
    aspect of modern life, have some basic oversight.”

- en: While ISPs generally say they don’t breach the principles of net neutrality,
    they object to the reclassification, in large part because it could give the FCC
    the ability to regulate their pricing. In this case, the FCC has decided to forbear
    rate regulation as it relates to the ISPs, though a future iteration of the agency
    could undo that with another regulatory proceeding.

- en: The FCC introduced net neutrality rules in 2015 after a large grassroots effort.
    But they were undone in 2017 when Trump-appointed Ajit Pai led the commission
    and helped to repeal them. In the meantime, states have stepped in with their
    own net neutrality laws, which advocates say have kept the ISPs at bay. But the
    industry claims that the lack of change in that period indicates that federal
    rules are unnecessary and fear they will impede investments in innovation.

- en: Though much of the FCC’s order echoes that of 2015, the agency’s rhetoric and
    justifications have been somewhat updated. Rosenworcel has argued that the rules
    will give the agency greater oversight of internet outages and will close a critical
    loophole in its authority to address telecommunications companies that pose national
    security risks by barring them from offering internet services on top of other
    communications services.

- en: FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Republican who staunchly opposes the agency
    taking up net neutrality through Title II reclassification, argued during the
    agency’s open meeting that the move is a symptom of a larger issue. He said the
    maneuver is an example of how judicial deference to federal agency authority in
    cases where the law is ambiguous has incentivized the executive branch to engage
    in “pressure campaigns” to have agencies do their bidding.

    comparing it to the authority used by the Education Department to get rid of student
    debt that was struck down. “The FCC does not presume to have the sweeping power
    to refashion Title II into an entirely new legislative scheme by picking and choosing
    which parts to apply,” he said. “The FCC throws whatever it can think of against
    the wall to see if anything sticks.”

- en: Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, who supported the rules, said he’s
    not concerned about how courts will evaluate the vote, saying the FCC’s authority
    to apply Title II to broadband providers is “clear as day.” He added that he opposes
    rate regulation of ISPs but disagrees with the notion that any affordable internet
    program can be construed as rate regulation. Starks called for a “permanent funding
    mechanism” for the Affordable Connectivity Program, which has provided internet
    subsidies for low-income consumers since the covid pandemic. The program is quickly
