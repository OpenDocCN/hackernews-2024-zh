    outside Google offices in New York, Sunnyvale and Seattle, which attracted hundreds
    of attendees, according to workers involved. The protests were led by the "No

    joint $1.2 billion contract to provide the Israeli government and military with
    cloud computing services, including AI tools, data centers and other cloud infrastructure.

    those among us who did not directly participate in yesterday''s historic, bicoastal
    10-hour sit-in protests," No Tech For Apartheid said in a statement, adding, "In
    the three years that we have been organizing against Project Nimbus, we have yet
    to hear from a single executive about our concerns. Google workers have the right
    to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor. These firings were

    impacted workers who were not directly involved in the protests. The company said
    some employees took longer to identify because their identity was "partly concealed."

    company and no matter which military it''s with, there are always going to be

    military use of its AI and cloud technology. Last month, Google Cloud engineer
    Eddie Hatfield interrupted a keynote speech from the managing director of Google's
    Israel business stating, "I refuse to build technology that powers genocide."
    Hatfield was [subsequently fired](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/08/google-fires-employee-who-protested-israel-tech-event-shuts-forum.html).
    That same week, an internal Google employee message board was shut down after
    staffers posted comments about the company's Israeli military contracts. A spokesperson
    at the time described the posts as "divisive content that is disruptive to our
    workplace."
