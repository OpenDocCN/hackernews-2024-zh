The United States’ closest neighbor is growing faster than its Group of Seven peers, as well as developing and more fertile countries such as India. In 2023, [the population here grew by more than 1.2 million people](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/240327/dq240327c-eng.htm), up 3.2 percent from the year before — the highest annual increase since 1957\. About 98 percent came from immigration.
