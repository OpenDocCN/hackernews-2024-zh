- en: Discord has shut down the Discord servers for the Nintendo Switch emulators
    [Suyu](https://suyu.dev/) and [Sudachi](https://github.com/sudachi-emu/sudachi)
    and has completely disabled their lead developers’ accounts — and the company
    isn’t answering our questions about why it went that far. Both Suyu and Sudachi
    began as forks of [Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo sued out of existence](/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath)
    on March 4th.

    Copyright Act requests. In this instance, there was also a court ordered injunction
    for the takedown of these materials, and we took action in a manner consistent
    with the court order,” reads part of a statement from Discord director of product
    communications Kellyn Slone to *The Verge*.

- en: The developers ofSuyu and Sudachi only received vague messages about how they
    were sharing content that allegedly violates intellectual property rights, according
    to images shared with *The Verge*. Meanwhile, Discord tells us that it’s following
    its normal process for DMCA takedown requests — but it’s not at all clear there
    was a valid DMCA takedown request or that those communities were actually violating
    IP rights, and it’s quite possible Discord isn’t following its own policy by kicking
    them out.

- en: Remember, Nintendo got Yuzu to settle rather than proving its case in court,
    and the settlement did not give Nintendo the rights to Yuzu’s freely copyable
    [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) code. Developers of Yuzu’s
    forks also claimed they were [changing the code further, among other practices](/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath#:~:text=they%E2%80%99re%20treating%20Nintendo%E2%80%99s%20lawsuit%20like%20a%20guidebook%20about%20how%20not%20to%20piss%20off%20the%20company.),
    in an effort to avoid pissing Nintendo off. And that code wasn’t hosted on Discord
    in any case.

    or even entire pirated games in these servers despite those commitments. At the
    end of the day, most people seeking out a Nintendo Switch emulator are looking
    to play Nintendo games on it. But with the servers gone, it’s hard to prove either
    way.

    does not suggest it would permaban, much less nuke entire servers, on the first
    offense. Discord did not answer questions about whether these users were repeat
    copyright infringers, had received any previous warnings, or were forwarded any
    takedown requests.

    email was that my account has broken the TOS, with no additional information.”
    He claims Sudachi wasn’t doing anything infringing. Later, he was told it vaguely
    had something to do with intellectual property but says Discord still hasn’t given
    him any details.'

- en: DMCA takedown requests are traditionally about *content*, not people or groups
    of people, and [Discord’s policy](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339349655-Discord-s-Copyright-IP-Policy)
    is written to reflect that. A valid takedown request has to include a description
    of the content that’s infringing and where to find it; a platform then takes down
    the content, and users can get it reinstated if they file a “counter-notice” that
    claims it wasn’t actually infringing. At that point, Discord has done its job,
    and Nintendo can sue the developer directly if it wants by using the counter-notice
    to track them down.

    de-platformed these emulators by nuking their communication channels.

    that Discord mentions *does* ban some third parties from “providing, marketing,
    advertising, promoting....or otherwise trafficking in Yuzu or any source code
    or features of Yuzu,” it’s specifically talking about third parties “acting in
    active concert and participation with Defendant.” Discord would not tell me that
    any of the Yuzu developers were connected to the Suyu or Sudachi projects.

    they don’t want to host, as we discussed back [when GitLab did something similar
    by deplatforming Suyu’s code](/2024/3/21/24108191/gitlab-suyu-nintendo-switch-emulator-takedown).
    And perhaps Discord did see evidence of software piracy in these Discords. That’s
    not currently how it’s justifying these channel wipes, though.

    me that after infighting, one group has splintered off to do its own projects,
    which may or may not be related to emulation; [here’s a Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/6FYdz9Sr)
    where a “real Suyu developer” claims the core development team has left the project
    because of Suyu’s “radioactivity” and its allegedly egotistic leader. (That leader
    does tend to [bark out orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/suyu/comments/1c10p18/founder_speaking_current_situation_and_future/),
