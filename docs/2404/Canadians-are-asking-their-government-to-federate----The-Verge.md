Canadians are asking their government to federate.

In the fediverse, that is. Petition e-4769, which so far only has 850 signatures, cites the “considerable controversy, harassment, misinformation, and strife” of corporate-run social media in asking the government to use [open-source alternatives like ActivityPub](/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network), the social protocol used by Mastodon (and which [US President Biden is now posting into](/2024/4/2/24119353/joe-biden-threads-mastodon-activitypub-fediverse)... from Threads), for communication, instead.

The petition is sponsored by Parliament Member Gord Johns, and closes on April 21st.
