    Kendall and the Air Force have embraced a fast-moving, forward-looking approach
    to field autonomous systems at speed and scale,” said Brian Schimpf, CEO and Co-Founder.
    “We are honored to be selected for this unprecedented opportunity, which signals
    a demand for continued expansion of the defense industrial base. Anduril is proud
