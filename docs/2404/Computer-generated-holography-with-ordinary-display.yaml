- en: We propose a method of computer-generated holography (CGH) using incoherent
    light emitted from a mobile phone screen. In this method, we suppose a cascade
    of holograms in which the first hologram is a color image displayed on the mobile
    phone screen. The hologram cascade is synthesized by solving an inverse problem
    with respect to the propagation of incoherent light. We demonstrate a three-dimensional
    color image reproduction using a two-layered hologram cascade composed of an iPhone
    and a spatial light modulator.
