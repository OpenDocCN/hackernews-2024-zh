- en: Oh, wow. This feels like a big number! I’m proud to announce the 40th release
    of Fedora Linux, a community-built and community-maintained operating system that
    belongs to *all* of us. I’m also happy to note that we’re back on track with an
    on-time release. Thank you to all Fedora contributors who made that possible,
    and who have, yet again, made this our best one ever.

    release for which I’ve served as Fedora Project Leader. We’ve gone through a lot
    in this last decade, and I’m incredibly happy to see our community thrive and
    grow. In addition to many long-familiar names and faces, it’s exciting to see
    a new generation with new energy and ideas. In some cases, this is *literally*
    a new generation, as many of you have grown up with Fedora. But at whatever age,
    I’m proud we’ve built such a welcoming and friendly community, and that we continue
    to work at improving our inclusiveness, diversity, and accessibility.

    40! If you have a system already, [Upgrading Fedora to a New Release](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/upgrading-fedora-new-release/)
    is easy. If you’re new, or just curious, head to [Get Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org)

    our variants which use ostree or image-based provisioning. Our technology isn’t
    really “immutable”, so this provides a better grouping. Read more about this at
    [Introducing Fedora Atomic Desktops](https://fedoramagazine.org/introducing-fedora-atomic-desktops/)
    — but in short, Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite will remain, while the other
    desktop  variants will become Fedora Sway Atomic and Fedora Budgie Atomic.

- en: Fedora Linux 40 ships with our first-ever PyTorch package. PyTorch is a popular
    framework for deep learning, and it can be difficult to reliably install with
    the right versions of drivers and libraries and so on. The current package only
    supports running on the CPU, without GPU or NPU acceleration, but this is just
    the first step. Our aim is to produce a complete stack with PyTorch and other
    popular tools ready to use on a wide variety of hardware out-of-the-box.

    support for AMD graphics cards. We plan to have that enabled for PyTorch in a
    future release.

    and libraries (and, of course, those updated tools are ready for developers to
    use). These updates bring bugfixes, security improvements, and performance gains.

- en: And, of course, hundreds of Fedora packagers and testers have worked to integrate
    the latest versions of open source software from thousands of upstream projects.
    Those projects, in turn, are made by an uncountable number of developers and contributors
    working on marketing, design, documentation, code, quality, translations, communications,
    events, governance, infrastructure, security, and so much more. Thank you again
    to everyone who makes Fedora amazing, and to everyone whose work has built this
    whole universe of free and open source software.

    today as well. If you upgrade from an earlier Fedora Linux release, you’ll get
    them as part of that. For new installations, please make sure to check for and
    apply updates as soon as possible.
