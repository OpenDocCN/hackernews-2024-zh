    an RFC to the gentoo-dev mailing list in late February about banning "<q>''AI''-backed
    (LLM/GPT/whatever) contributions</q>" to the Gentoo Linux project. Górny wrote
    that the spread of the "<q>AI bubble</q>" indicated a need for Gentoo to formally
    take a stand on AI tools. After a lengthy discussion, the Gentoo Council [voted](https://lwn.net/ml/gentoo-dev/f56698adfcd7eae64a82d1b367e8af71a1261819.camel%40gentoo.org/)
    unanimously this week to adopt his proposal and ban contributions generated with
    AI/ML tools.'

    view of the ethics of the use of AI. Górny took issue with everything from the
    energy consumption driven by AI to labor issues and "<q>all kinds of spam and

    there were objections to packaging AI software for Gentoo. This did not elicit
    a response in favor or against on the list, but the [AI policy page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council/AI_policy)

    that he thought it made sense to consider the use of AI, but suggested the [Gentoo
    developer certificate of origin](https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html#certificate-of-origin)
    (DCO) already had the necessary language to prohibit AI-generated contributions.
    "<q>Perhaps we ought to just re-advertise the policy that already exists?</q>"
    He also poked at the ethical case laid out by Górny, and suggested it would alienate
    some contributors even if the majority of the project was in favor. Freeman said
    it was not a bad idea to reiterate that Gentoo didn't want contributions that
    were just piped out of a GPT application into forums, bug reports, commits, etc.,
    but didn't think that it required any new policy.

    that there is overlap with existing policy, but did not find it redundant and
    supported the idea of a clarification on how to deal with AI-generated code. Sam
    James [agreed](https://lwn.net/ml/gentoo-dev/87le757phq.fsf@gentoo.org/) with
    the proposal but worried that it was "<q>slightly performative [...] given that
    we can't really enforce it</q>." Górny [wrote](https://lwn.net/ml/gentoo-dev/baa3755ec638bac5abb35fedf17cf1958b3615d0.camel@gentoo.org/)
    that it was unlikely that the project could detect these contributions, or that
    it would want to actively pursue finding them. The point, he said, is to make
    a statement that they are undesirable.

    that would not help much, and dismissed the quality of content generated by ChatGPT.

    that Gentoo would always have poor quality contributions, and could simply use
    common sense to filter out low-quality LLM material. "<q>We already have methods
    for weeding out low quality contributions and bad faith contributors - let's trust
    in these and see what we can do to strengthen these tools and processes.</q>"
    He argued in favor of using LLMs for code documentation and asked why he had to
    type out an explanation of what his code does if an LLM can generate something
    that only requires some editing. The proposal, he said, was a bad idea and banning
    LLMs "<q>at this point is just throwing the baby out with the bathwater</q>".
    Guidelines would be fine, even a ban on completely AI-generated works, but he
    was opposed to "<q>pre-emptively banning useful tools</q>".

    tools trained on Gentoo's current repository should be OK, as well as using LLMs
    to assist with commit messages. But, he said, a lot of FOSS projects were seeing
    too much AI spam and were not interested in picking the "<q>possibly good</q>"
    parts out.

    to objections to such a ban, it is not surprising that the council voted to accept
    Górny''s proposal. Now the question is how Gentoo implements the ban. In an emailed
    response to questions, Górny said that Gentoo is relying on trust in its contributors
    to adhere to the policy rather than trying to police contributions to see if they
    were generated with AI/ML tools:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In both cases, our primary goal is to make it clear what's acceptable and what's
    not, and politely ask our contributors to respect that. If we receive contributions
    that contain really "weird" mistakes, the kind that [do not] seem likely to be
    caused by a human error, we're going to start asking questions, but I think that's
    the best we can do.

    in looking to shut it out rather than trying to join the party. How well the policy
    works, and how soon it is tested, will be interesting to see.
