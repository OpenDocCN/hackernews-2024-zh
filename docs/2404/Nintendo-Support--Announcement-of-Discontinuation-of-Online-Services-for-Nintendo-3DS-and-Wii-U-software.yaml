    that it is still available even after online services ended. However, because
    SpotPass uses online communication, SpotPass features are longer available.

    which is pre-installed on Nintendo 3DS family systems, but you are no longer able
    to use features that use online communication (such as receiving new panels in
    Puzzle Swap).
