    have filed to have a vote on whether to join the Actors’ Equity Association, which
    represents live performers all over the country, from actors on Broadway to [strippers](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/business/strippers-union/index.html) in

    such campaigns fall short of filing to hold a vote. But the union announced Wednesday
    that it has filed cards signed by more than two-thirds of the 1,700 employees,
    seeking to have the National Labor Relations Board conduct an election.

    since Disneyland Resort opened in the 1950s and have watched other workers in

    the “cast members” terms used at Disney to refer to its employees.

    wake of a number of high-profile [contract wins by unions](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/21/business/big-paydays-union-members/index.html)
    that provided union members with large pay raises. Included in those wins were
    contracts covering 32,000 hourly workers at Disney World in Orlando, Florida,
    which gave them raises equal to $3 an hour by the end of last year and raises
    of about 37% over their previous hourly rate by 2026.

    by more than a dozen unions. Those unionized jobs include everything from retail
    and food service workers to security guards, hair and make-up artists and pyrotechnic
    workers. But it doesn’t include the performers who dress up as characters such
    as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck or Goofy and interact with visitors. Workers
    performing in the same roles are unionized at some other Disney theme parks, such
    as Disney World.

    conditions.”

    this entire process,” he said.

    to company policies that said schedule changes are based on the safety of visitors
    and employees, such as the case of inclement weather, and that no notice is required
    when that operational necessity is applied. She also said all cast members, whether
    or not they are represented by a union, have multiple methods to communicate safety
    concerns, including contacting park leadership, safety meetings, roundtables or
    using an anonymous hotline.

- en: But Elefante and Vo say they believe the majority of the group is ready to vote
    for the union due to their concerns. The two-thirds majority signing cards is
    not a guarantee the union will win a vote — support often decreases as management
    campaigns against the union in meetings with employees. But that level of support
    suggests it has a good chance of passing.

    that pay rates can increase. She said union representation would embody the same
