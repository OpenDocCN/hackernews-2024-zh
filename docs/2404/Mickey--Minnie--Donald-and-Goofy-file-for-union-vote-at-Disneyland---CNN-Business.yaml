    that provided union members with large pay raises. Included in those wins were
    contracts covering 32,000 hourly workers at Disney World in Orlando, Florida,
    which gave them raises equal to $3 an hour by the end of last year and raises
    of about 37% over their previous hourly rate by 2026.

    by more than a dozen unions. Those unionized jobs include everything from retail
    and food service workers to security guards, hair and make-up artists and pyrotechnic
    workers. But it doesn’t include the performers who dress up as characters such
    as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck or Goofy and interact with visitors. Workers
    performing in the same roles are unionized at some other Disney theme parks, such
    as Disney World.
