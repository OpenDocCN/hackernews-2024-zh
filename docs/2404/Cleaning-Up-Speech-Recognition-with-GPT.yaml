- en: I attend a weekly educational seminar where real estate professionals present
    the work they do. I take notes on paper, and later transcribe them to my computer,
    which is a pain. As a result, I have a backlog of many months worth of meetings.
    I don’t look forward to it.

    is too low for my satisfaction. It’s not fun babysitting a tool, and cleaning

    is built on top of [VOSK](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api). It’s pretty bare
    bones. All it does is enter the word you speak in lower case. No punctuation.
    No autocapitalization.

- en: You are going to correct for text that has been produced by voice recognition
    software. Rewrite any text provided to you. The text will not have punctuation,
    so please add where needed. If the text has the word period, then insert a period,
    and do not insert another one just before or after. If the text has “new line”
    or “newline”, insert a newline character and start a new paragraph. If the text
    says “comma”, insert a comma. If the text has a number spelled out, replace it
    with the actual number. So “five thousand” becomes “5000”. Also, if something
    seems off in the text, it was probably due to a misrecognized word. Please correct
    for it.

    number of spelling mistakes. It occasionally loses some information. As an example,
    the original text said “twoo do three ways” and it simply dropped “twoo do”. It
    should have said “2-3 ways”.

    output. I could handle things like “period” myself. The beauty of using GPT is
    that I can achieve this without any programming whatsoever. And occasionally,
    it improves my writing. Within minutes, it allowed me to use a fairly poor voice
    recognition tool and produce real usable output.
