    This study examined a method in which the disposal of a paper (object) on which
    participants wrote down their descriptions or thoughts about a provocative event
    could neutralise anger. Participants threw the anger-written paper into a trash
    box in Experiment 1, and put the paper into a shredder in Experiment 2\. If the
    action of disposal is crucial to modifying emotions, anger would be reduced only
    in participants in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2, as predicted by the grounded
    separation procedure^([29](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR29 "Lee, S. W. S.

    Nevertheless, if anger was modified by the meaning of disposal, the subjective
    ratings of anger would be eliminated in both experiments. The disposal of the
    paper with the written descriptions would remove the psychological existence of
    anger for the provoked participants along with the disposal of paper by the dynamic
    interactions with the object^([24](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR24 "Koole,

    *SD* = 1.00, 95% CI [2.70, 3.49]; *M*[*retention*] = 3.06, *SD* = 1.03, 95% CI
    [2.64, 3.47]) was higher than at baseline (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.45, *SD* = 0.66,
    95% CI [2.18, 2.71]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.50, *SD* = 0.84, 95% CI [2.16, 2.83])
    and post-writing (*M*[*disposal*] = 2.06, *SD* = 0.65, 95% CI [1.80, 2.32]; *M*[*retention*] = 2.39,
    *SD* = 0.88, 95% CI [2.04, 2.73]). The 95% CIs of the disposal group overlapped
    a little bit between post-provocation [2.70, 3.49] and baseline periods [2.18,
    2.71], and those of the retention group overlapped between both the post-provocation
    [2.64, 3.47] and baseline [2.16, 2.83]. The 95% CIs for the post-writing means
    partially overlapped between the groups. A 2 (group) × 3 (period) mixed ANOVA
    revealed a significant main effect of period [*F* (2, 96) = 28.64, *p* < 0.001,
    partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.37, BF[10] > 100]. However, the main effect of group [*F*
    (1, 48) = 0.29, *p* > 0.05, partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.01, BF[10] = 0.32] and the interaction
    between group and period were not significant [*F* (2, 96) = 1.35, *p* > 0.05,
    partial *η*^(*2*) = 0.03, BF[10] = 0.31]. Multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni
    method revealed that the subjective negative affect post-provocation was significantly
    higher than at baseline and post-writing (*ps* < 0.05).

- en: This study examined whether writing about the provocative event and disposing
    of the paper into a trash can would suppress anger. The provocation treatments
    evoked anger in both the groups similarly. Nevertheless, the retention group still
    showed significantly higher anger compared to levels at the baseline period, while
    the disposal group completely eliminated their anger after the disposal of the
    anger-written paper. These results suggest that the disposal of the paper containing
    ruminated anger into the trash can neutralise anger. Our interpretation is that
    the act of throwing the paper with ruminated anger into the trash can produces
    a feeling similar to the psychological existence (anger) being discarded, leading
    to anger elimination, since the psychological entity (anger) was disposed along
    with the physical object (anger-written paper).

    played a critical role in reducing anger. Since the paper was distanced from participants
    in the disposal group, whereas the paper in the retention group was located by
    them. Nevertheless, Zhang et al.^([44](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR44 "Zhang,

    showed that engaging in an avoidance action rather than creating physical distance
    was critical for reversing the perceived effect of negative thoughts. In their
    study (Experiment 5), participants in avoidance action conditions either threw
    the ball to the opposite corner of the room (creating physical distance between
    themselves and the ball), or pretended to throw the ball (creating no distance
    between themselves and the ball). Participants in the no-avoidance action condition
    either carried the ball to the opposite corner of the room and left it there (creating
    physical distance between the self and the ball without involving a throwing action)
    or held the ball in their non-dominant hand (creating no distance). Participants
    in both avoidance action conditions reversed the negative thoughts, while participants
    in both no-avoidance conditions did not. Avoidance actions were crucial in their
    study. Therefore, the physical distance would not contribute to reduce anger in
    this study. However, disposal action might be the key to neutralising anger in
    this study. Nevertheless, we assume that the meaning (i.e. interpretation) of
    disposal is more important than the action itself. Other studies have also suggested
    that the meaning of an action is critical for determining its impact, not the
    action itself^([30](/articles/s41598-024-57916-z#ref-CR30 "Brinol, P., Gasco,

    This study could not exclude throwing action''s potential contribution to neutralising
    anger. Thus, we conducted another experiment to exclude the potential contribution
    of the throwing action as much as possible, confirm the effectiveness of the disposal
    method, and explore the variation in this method.'
