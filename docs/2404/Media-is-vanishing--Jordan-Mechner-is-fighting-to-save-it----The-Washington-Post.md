Francis Mechner remembers everything, including the time his family used watercolor paintings by Hitler to save their lives. He insists his son, Jordan, write it all down.

“I’m the only one left who remembers who these people and places were,” the father says in 2015, pointing to a family portrait of Uncle “Joji,” who had bought the paintings years before Hitler rose to power. The paintings were presented to barter for visas out of Nazi-occupied Austria. “A picture is meaningless without context.”
