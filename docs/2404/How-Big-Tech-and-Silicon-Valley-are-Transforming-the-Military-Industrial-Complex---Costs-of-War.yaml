- en: America’s military-industrial complex has been rapidly expanding from the Capital
    Beltway to Silicon Valley. Although much of the Pentagon’s budget is spent on
    conventional weapons systems, the Defense Department has increasingly sought to
    adopt AI-enabled systems. Big tech companies, venture capital, and private equity
    firms benefit from multi-billion dollar Defense contracts, and smaller defense
    tech startups that “move fast and break things” also receive increased Defense
    funding. This report illustrates how a growing portion of the Defense Department’s
    spending is going to large, well-known tech firms, including some of the most
    highly valued corporations in the world.

    a lack of transparency makes it difficult to discern the true amount of U.S. spending
    diverted to Big Tech. Yet, research reveals that the amount is substantial, and
    growing. According to the nonprofit research organization [Tech Inquiry](https://techinquiry.org/docs/InternationalCloud.pdf),
    three of the world’s biggest tech corporations were awarded approximately $28
    billion from 2018 to 2022, including Microsoft ($13.5 billion), Amazon ($10.2
    billion), and Alphabet, which is Google’s parent company ($4.3 billion). This
    paper found that the top five contracts to major tech firms between 2019 and 2022
    had contract ceilings totaling at least $53 billion combined.

- en: From 2021 through 2023, venture capital firms [reportedly](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/defense-tech-boom-ukraine-china-israel) pumped
    nearly $100 billion into defense tech startup companies — an amount 40 percent
    higher than the previous seven years combined. This report examines how Silicon
    Valley startups, big tech, and venture capital who benefit from classified Defense
    contracts will create costly, high-tech defense products that are ineffective,
    unpredictable, and unsafe – all on the American taxpayer’s dime.
