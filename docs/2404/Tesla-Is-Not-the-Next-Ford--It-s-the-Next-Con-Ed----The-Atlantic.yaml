    features have been [linked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/10/tesla-autopilot-crashes-elon-musk/)

    the company recalled its entire fleet of Cybertrucks. A mechanical problem that

    Tesla’s primary focus is now on AI and self-driving cars. But even if that pivot
    fails, the company has positioned itself to be on the edge of another, perhaps
    more crucial part of the green transition: delivering and storing America’s power.
    Tesla’s EV chargers are ascendant, if not dominant, as are its huge batteries
    that store renewable energy for homes and even entire neighborhoods. Profits from
    Tesla’s energy business were up 140 percent compared with the same period last
    year, and Musk asserted yesterday that the division will continue to grow “significantly
    faster than the car business.” The company’s future may not lie in following the
    footsteps of Ford, then, so much as those of Duke Energy and Con Edison. Tesla,
    in other words, is transforming into a utility.'

    nearly all future EVs in America will rely on Tesla. Just as gas stations were
