- en: Space startup Exodus Propulsion Technologies claims to have achieved a breakthrough,
    stumbling upon an entirely new force of nature that could power thrusters that
    don't need propellant to work.

- en: As [*The Debrief* reports](https://thedebrief.org/nasa-veterans-propellantless-propulsion-drive-that-physics-says-shouldnt-work-just-produced-enough-thrust-to-defeat-earths-gravity/),
    co-founder Charles Buhler — a former NASA engineer who's worked on a number of
    major programs including the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope,
    and the Space Shuttle — said the discovery could be a major turning point in humanity's
    quest to explore space.

- en: Buhler makes some wildly ambitious claims that will likely face plenty of scrutiny
    from the scientific community — and it's unclear if his startup's claims will
    survive.

    one can generate forces unlike anything humankind has done before," Buhler told
    *The Debrief*. "It will be this force that we will use to propel objects for the
    next 1,000 years... until the next thing comes."'

    Conference (APEC), a highly unusual "[anti-gravity club](https://thedebrief.org/inside-the-worlds-most-exclusive-and-strange-anti-gravity-club/)"
    that attracts some of the biggest names in the field.

- en: The team's drive, which it says uses electrostatics to enable Buhler's "new
    force," isn't exactly a powerhouse, producing a mere 10 milliNewtons. To put that
    into perspective, holding a mass of [about 100 grams](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2004/WaiWingLeung.shtml),
    or a medium-sized apple, in the palm of your hand exerts 1 Newton, or 100 times
    more force.

    work in space!" Buhler assured *The Debrief*.

    to be supported on a dielectric film," he explained. "Our aim is to make it as
    lightweight as possible, but that is sometimes difficult since the films and their
    coatings have to have a high dielectric breakdown strength."'

    physics that can essentially place force on an object" given "an asymmetry in
    either electrostatic pressure or some kind of electrostatic divergent field."

    subject matter and the device's strained relationship with the established laws
    of physics.

    seem to violate a lot of energy laws that we have," Buhler [told APEC cofounder
    and moderator Tim Ventura](https://youtu.be/WhsKMWOYuYo), adding that "we''re
    hoping to do some demos" in space.'

    NASA's [highly controversial EmDrive](https://futurism.com/tags/emdrive) and startup
    [Applied Physics' "warp drive](https://futurism.com/startup-actual-warp-drive),"
    both of which similarly [appear to break the laws of physics](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2269544-a-warp-drive-that-doesnt-break-the-laws-of-physics-is-possible/).
