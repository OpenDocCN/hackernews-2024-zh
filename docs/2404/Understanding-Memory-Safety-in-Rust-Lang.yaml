    the choice for people has the goal of writing fast, machine native software and
    web applications. The way that the language was made was for strong guarantees
    for memory safety. We are here to try to understand this better.

    features of ensuring the memory of a program is allocated and disposed of properly
    when the program is used and terminated. Noted by the White House National Cybersecurity
    Director, warns that without taking proper care of programming standards, there
    can be [serious exploits and vulnerabilities which can cause some major real world
    consequences](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/security-software/white-house-urges-developers-to-avoid-c-and-c-use-memory-safe-programming-languages?ref=coderoasis.com).
    The languages like Go and Rust – which put memory safety first – are gaining more
    and more attention.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important thing to understand about the Rust Programming Language is
    that they do not require an extra library or analysis tool to check for issues.
    They can be optional though to double check – yet the memory safety features are
    built right into the programming language by default. They are mandatory and enforced
    standards before any of your code ever runs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, in Rust, code that is not memory safe are treated as *compiler errors*
    and not *runtime errors*. This has major advantages to coding in Rust because
    code that is invalid will never compile. This means it will never make it to a
    production environment. With languages like `C` or `C++`, memory errors are far
    too often are only discovered at runtime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also need to remember that this does not mean that the Rust programming
    language or any software applications coded in it is completely bulletproof either.
    There can be rare issues – like [race conditions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/races.html?ref=coderoasis.com)
    – that are still the developer's responsibility to make sure are not an issue
    with their code. Yet, at the same time, Rust does take a lot of common exploits
    and vulnerabilities out of the equation for us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Programming languages like `C#`, `Python`, and `Java` require the developer
    to do memory management manually. With Rust, the developer is more able to focus
    on writing code and getting the job done more efficiently. This level of convenience
    also comes at a small cost – usually in speed or the need of a larger runtime.
    From my experience dabbling around with Rust, the binaries are usually always
    more compact and runs at native machine level speeds by default while remaining
    memory safe the whole time.

- en: Immutable by Default
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first things I learned about researching the the Rust programming
    language is that all variables are immutable by default. This means that they
    can't be reassigned or modified. If you wanted to change or modify a immutable
    variable or function, then you have to specifically declare it as mutable for
    it to be changed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This may seem like something very small or not important to a lot of developers,
    but it has the amazing effect to forcing the developer to be highly conscious
    of what values need to be mutable in the software application that they are developing
    – this includes *when* they need them to be also. The results of the Rust application
    are making it way easier for the developer to tell when, where, and what you can
    change.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of *immutable by default* is very important and different from the
    ideas of a constant. Let's take a immutable variable as an example. This variable
    can be computed then stored as an immutable at the runtime. This means that it
    can first be computed, then stored, and not changed. Now, let's take a constant.
    The constant must be computable at the time of compile – this is also before the
    program ever runs. There are many different kinds of values – such as one being
    of user input, as an example – that can't be stored as a constant this way at
    all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `C++` programming language assumes this is the opposite of the Rust programming
    language – where everything is highly mutable. By default, you must use the `const`
    keyword to declare a something as immutable. In theory, you could honestly adopt
    the `C++` coding style of using `const` by default. This will only ever cover
    the code that you write for your own software applications. While using Rust by
    default, the way you code in it ensures that all software applications are written
    in the programming language are immutable.

    The one that comes to the top of my head is the need to learn how to use the language
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will admit that switching to a new programming language is never an easy thing
    for me. Rust, so far, has a massive learning curve for me to learn. It is taking
    me some time to grasp the memory management model to be able to produce usable
    code for my applications which I want to learn to make. The learning curve of
    the language has been a big discussion online for people starting out to the experts
    of the language in many different forums, communities, and websites.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The older languages like `C` and `C++` which has even larger and more experienced
    developer community argues in their favor over Rust. They also have something
    which Rust lacks in a few ways which is code examples, libraries, and complete
    application examples to work off of. For me, it's not that hard to understand
    why some people choose to use any of the `C` languages over Rust at times. They
    have more development tools and resources that exist around them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, at the same time, within the decade that Rust has been around, it has gained
    a lot of development tools, good documentation, and an amazing community to learn
    and discuss with. They make it super easy to get up to speed and take off development
    of good software applications. The amazing collection of third-party libraries
    – also known as Crates – is highly expansive and growing more and more everyday.
    Developers who are joining the Rust programming language could require some retraining
    and learning new tools, but you will barely ever lack the resources you need or
    a library for a given project.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, every value in the Rust programming language has an *owner*. This
    means that any value – anywhere or any point in the code also – can only have
    full read/write control can have it at one time. The ownership of a value can
    be given away or better yet be *borrowed* from the original owner. Yet at the
    same time of a value being borrowed, this behavior is strictly tracked by the
    compiler. If any code tries to violate the ownership rules which are defined in
    the programming language than the compiler refuses to compile the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we look to see how the `C` programming language handles this, we come to
    find out that there is no ownership with objects. This means that anything we
    want can be accessed by any other thing at literally anytime that it wants access
    to it. All of the responsibility of how anything is changed, modified, or used
    rests with how the programmer developes the software application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other programming languages such as `Python,` `C#`, and `Java`, the ownership
    rules just flat out do not exist at all. This is also due to that just don't need
    to exist either. This usually means that that they handle Object access – and
    also includes memory safety – is handled at the runtime. Like before, this comes
    at a cost – it can also be big or small depending on the software application
    – which is the speed or the size or even presence of a runtime.

    it to `s2`. This prevents from having double free errors, because `s2` goes out
    of scope. This allows the memory to be freed only one time. If we try to use `s1`
    after handing over ownership of the variable to `s2` then we will receive a compile
    time error.

    are passed unto functions. If the `type` implements the `Copy` trait – such as
    `integers`, `booleans`, and other types – the value is also copied. Then the original
    variable that was called can still be used also. Otherwise when the ownership
    is moved, the original variable can no longer be used.

    to take ownership of it. This is known as barrowing. There are two types of borrowing
    – they are immutable and mutable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the following example, `s` is used as a reference to `s1`, meaning it does
    not own the `String`. Since the `s` variable does not take ownership, the `s1`
    variable will remain valid after the call to `calculate_length`.

    is being borrowed. However, there is a big limitation. There can only be one mutable
    reference to a piece of data in a particular scope. This is to prevent people
    from data races at the time of compiling.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lifetimes are references to values in the Rust programming language that just
    don't have owners – but they do have Lifetimes. This means it's a scope of which
    a given reference is allowed to be valid. In most cases coding in Rust, lifetimes
    are left implicit, since the compiler can trace them easily. Yet, at the same
    time, lifetimes can also be explicitly used for more complex use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also need to remember that if you attempt to access or modify something
    outside of the lifetime that it was given – or better yet if it has gone out of
    scope – it will result in a compiler error. The goal of this is to prevent whole
    classes of bugs making it all the way to production environments or live software
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`Dangling pointers` can emerge when you try to access a variable or function
    that has either been deallocated or has gone out of scope. This also tends to
    happen in the `C` and `C++` programming languages more than Rust. The `C` programming
    language has no official or proper enforcement at the compile time for a lifetime
    of an object. The `C++` programming language has *smart pointers* concepts to
    help prevent this – they are not native or implemented or enforced by default
    – so you will have to opt-in to using them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A lot of people leave the safety of the programming language up to the developers.
    What I mean is when it comes to memory safety practices in `C` or the `C++` programming
    language, it is usually a coding style that a developer has picked up on or even
    a institutional requirement – it's not something that the programming language
    outright requires you to do by default or is built into the language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With programming languages such as `C#`, `Java`, or even `Python`, the memory
    management is the core responsibility of that languages runtime. This comes at
    a pretty big cost – in my personal opinion – of requiring a pretty big runtime.
    This can highly reduce the execution speeds of the software application. By default,
    the Rust programming language reduces the execution speed by enforcing the `lifetimes`
    rules before the code ever gets a chance to run.

    programming languages that are lacking memory safety features by default or natively.
    They are transforming other languages enough to adopt these features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These can be pretty ambitious ideas for the other languages that could be harder
    to implement. As an example if they were to add these features to `C` or `C++`,
    then we would have to talk about backwards compatibility. The behaviors that Rust
    brings by default to memory safety are harder to because it would force a hard
    divide between the existing legacy code and the new behaviors which developers
    will have to account for when switching over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main thing that gives the Rust programming Language its place in the programming
    world and the most notable feature that it offers over other languages is the
    memory safety and the compile time behaviors that guarantees it. Using these features
    – the memory safety the way Rust wants you to do it – will demand more work from
    the developer initially, but the trade offs always pay off later in the software
    application.
