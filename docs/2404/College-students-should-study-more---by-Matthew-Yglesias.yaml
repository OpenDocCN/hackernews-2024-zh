    political speeches, the film wrestled with one of the major social themes of our

    to it. Paul Giamatti plays Paul Hunham, a teacher at the fictional Barton Academy

    Academy）的一名教师。巴顿是一所精英男子寄宿学校，尽管学生大多非常富裕，但住宿条件并不特别好。
- en: 'Part of the ethic of this kind of school is that students live under rather
    spartan conditions, away from the comforts of their parents’ posh lifestyles.
    And Hunham, who teaches ancient history, is a particularly strict old-school teacher.
    He maintains high standards for discipline and for learning. He assigns a lot
    of reading, expects his students to do it, and gives them bad grades if they don’t.
    He expects students who receive bad grades to suffer consequences. In his understanding
    of himself and his job, this is the role of an elite educational institution:
    Wealthy parents hire Barton to put their kids through the paces, because they
    think that this will be good for the students in the longer term. The school is
    providing a service, and part of the service they are providing is harshness.'

    and not flunking their precious darlings. The new headmaster’s approach, while
    not admirable, does seem to be an analytically correct assessment of the market
    — Barton is a private school that needs donors and paying customers. There may
    have been a time when the donors and the customers wanted what Hunham is offering,
    but they don’t anymore. And in the movie, this is connected thematically to a
    decline in the character of the American elite. One scene set in the Barton chapel
    pans across the memorials to Barton graduates who died in various wars of American
    history, including many alumni who perished in the world wars. But only one Barton
    student died in Vietnam, a Black kid who attended the school on scholarship because
    his mom ran the cafeteria. A kid, we learn, who wanted to go to college but didn’t
    have the money, so he enlisted.

    B+s and B+s into Bs. That generated some whining from students, but ultimately,
    to restore old-school academic values, schools will need to hand out Cs and Ds
    that put students at the risk of real negative consequences, like loss of scholarships,
