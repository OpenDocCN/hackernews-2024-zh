    dramedy “The Holdovers” was, I think, considered somewhat slight, despite being
    well-regarded. But although it lacked any literal nuclear explosions or dramatic
    political speeches, the film wrestled with one of the major social themes of our
    times: a kind of structural transformation in the value proposition of elite education
    that I think about whenever I see a new campus controversy.'

- en: This is not so much the plot of the movie (no spoilers here) as the backdrop
    to it. Paul Giamatti plays Paul Hunham, a teacher at the fictional Barton Academy
    in the 1970s. Barton is an elite boys’ boarding school, but even though the students
    are mostly very rich, the accommodations are not particularly nice.
  prefs: []

- en: 'Part of the ethic of this kind of school is that students live under rather
    spartan conditions, away from the comforts of their parents’ posh lifestyles.
    And Hunham, who teaches ancient history, is a particularly strict old-school teacher.
    He maintains high standards for discipline and for learning. He assigns a lot
    of reading, expects his students to do it, and gives them bad grades if they don’t.
    He expects students who receive bad grades to suffer consequences. In his understanding
    of himself and his job, this is the role of an elite educational institution:
    Wealthy parents hire Barton to put their kids through the paces, because they
    think that this will be good for the students in the longer term. The school is
    providing a service, and part of the service they are providing is harshness.'

    the values the prior headmaster who hired him believed in.
  prefs: []

    keep wealthy and well-connected parents happy, which means doing what they want
    and not flunking their precious darlings. The new headmaster’s approach, while
    not admirable, does seem to be an analytically correct assessment of the market
    — Barton is a private school that needs donors and paying customers. There may
    have been a time when the donors and the customers wanted what Hunham is offering,
    but they don’t anymore. And in the movie, this is connected thematically to a
    decline in the character of the American elite. One scene set in the Barton chapel
    pans across the memorials to Barton graduates who died in various wars of American
    history, including many alumni who perished in the world wars. But only one Barton
    student died in Vietnam, a Black kid who attended the school on scholarship because
    his mom ran the cafeteria. A kid, we learn, who wanted to go to college but didn’t
    have the money, so he enlisted.

    how those pressures were resolved in favor of ever-more-competitive admissions,

    just don’t spend that much time on coursework. Unfortunately, a lot of attention
    was paid to this question during the depths of the Great Recession when young
    people were facing severe economic problems that sort of muddied the waters. When
    the NYT did a “room for debate” forum on the subject of reduced study effort,
    for example, Anya Kamenetz’s response focused on students who need to [work on

    But even if you look [exclusively at full-time college students](https://www.heritage.org/education/report/big-debt-little-study-what-taxpayers-should-know-about-college-students-time-use),
    we’re talking about less than three hours per day on in-class and out-of-class
    education.

    and Josipa Roksa published “Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses,”](https://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028569)
    which made a huge splash at the time but is now rarely discussed. They used data
    from a test called the Collegiate Learning Assessment and showed that while some
    students learn a lot in college and have notably improved academic skills, a very
    large minority do not. They note that the actual amount of learning varies substantially
    by college major. The way they bucket this, science/math majors learn the most
    followed by humanities/social science majors, followed by engineering majors.
    But then health, communications, education/social work, and business students
    learn basically nothing.'

    a 2014 followup book](https://www.vox.com/2014/9/4/6101987/aspiring-adults-adrift-roksa-arum-millennials-academically-adrift)

    in their college education rather than macroeconomic circumstances. Over the past
    decade, as macroeconomic conditions have improved, [millennials have caught up](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2024/01/24/young-people-have-a-lot-more-wealth-than-we-thought/).
    Which is just to say that Arum and Roksa’s critics were right — this doesn’t explain
    very much about big picture economic outcomes. That being said, given the role
    of higher education in American society, the portrait they paint of schools where
    many students don’t learn anything is still important. They show that lack of
    learning is associated with lack of time spent on schoolwork, and [Philip Babcock
    and Mindy Marks have shown](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15954) that over the
    decades, students have been spending less and less time on studying — “full-time
    students allocated 40 hours per week toward class and studying in 1961, whereas
    by 2003 they were investing about 27 hours per week.”

    hit the books is to get good grades, and over time, it’s become easier and easier

    University, he made a big push to try to reverse the trend toward grade inflation
    that had occurred over the previous generation. And if you zoom in on exactly
    when I was in school in the early 2000s, [you can see that it was working](https://www.chartr.co/stories/2023-12-08-2-grade-inflation-at-harvard).
    My particular cohort of students was the only one on record to experience slightly
    declining grades.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I would note that Summers barely even did anything. He just said, in clear
    and forceful language, that he thought the grading had become too lax. That meant
    professors who privately had a bit of Hunham in them felt that they would be backed-up
    if they got a little harsher. I was enrolled in one large class with a distinguished
    professor who pulled a few papers (including one of mine) out of her TA’s grading
    stack and re-marked them lower in front of everyone.

    successors did not continue the effort. So the early aughts blip is just an oddity

    grades as soon as they got the green light to do so from administrators. TAs were
    happy to go along with instructions to be tougher, if that’s what their bosses
    wanted. And most professors, I assume, don’t have incredibly strong feelings about
    this and just want to be roughly average, so when the behavior of the outliers
    starts to shift, the behavior of average professors shifts as well. Of course,
    people would complain. The nascent Summers-era crackdown was turning A-s into
    B+s and B+s into Bs. That generated some whining from students, but ultimately,
    to restore old-school academic values, schools will need to hand out Cs and Ds
    that put students at the risk of real negative consequences, like loss of scholarships,
    getting kicked out of school, or heading into the job market looking like a real
    fuckup. And then you get the problem that Hunham confronted: Is this what students
    and their parents want?'

    and [2011](https://archive.nytimes.com/economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/the-history-of-college-grade-inflation/),

    of competition is to attract the highest-quality applicants. And applicants want,
    in part, a fun consumption experience. That means creating plenty of paths for
    students to take courses that are graded very generously, ones where a lot of
    work may be assigned in a formal sense, but it’s pretty easy to get away with
    not doing it.

    answer the problems correctly, you will get a bad grade. And depending on your
    background and talent, you may need to work very hard to answer the problems correctly.
    That being said, I like the Hunham example because it’s a reminder that there’s
    nothing *inherently* easy about humanities subjects. You can give students in
    an ancient civilizations class a test that requires them to accurately reproduce
    a lot of detailed information about the Peloponnesian War and give them a low
    grade if they fail to master it.

    read and even compose in Greek and Latin, which seems like it would be hard. I
    had an old-fashioned teacher in school who made us memorize poems. This is a great
    example of something that almost anyone *can* do — part of the historical origin
    of verse is that, for whatever reason, it’s easier for our brains to remember
    — but that requires meaningful effort. To this day, I can recite [“Spring and
    Fall”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44400/spring-and-fall) or [“The
    Emperor of Ice Cream”](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45234/the-emperor-of-ice-cream)
    by heart, but it took a lot of time and practice when I was in that class.

    a lot of grant money and don’t particularly want to deal with annoying undergraduates,

    budgets in terms of student interest, which means they need to try to give the
    people what they want, which is easy classes. It doesn’t necessarily *have* to
    be like that. People pay to attend group exercise classes where the whole purpose
    is for the instructor to challenge the students and push them to work harder than
    they normally would. Students would learn more if they worked harder, and they
    would work harder if the grading were tougher, and “I would like my child to learn
    a lot in school” isn’t a particularly outlandish idea.

    draw the line between what’s important to the institution qua institution and
    what a person who works at the institution cares about. It also helps to structure
    disagreements. If two people with very different ideas about what should be done
    can at least agree on what they are trying to accomplish, that sets the stage
    for some kind of resolution. A mission is also a good way of managing diversity.
    People with very different backgrounds and values can find ways to set their differences
    aside and cooperate toward a common goal, *if* they have a common goal.

    of work. The market has decided that the customers are mostly interested in peer
    effects and having a good time, and schools are rewarded more for being good at
    selection than for being good at education. This leaves students with lots of
    downtime that they expend in various ways — I started a blog, Milan is going to
