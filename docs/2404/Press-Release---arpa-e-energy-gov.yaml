- en: '**WASHINGTON, D.C. —** The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced
    up to $10 million in funding to explore nickel extraction from soil using plants—a
    process known as phytomining—to establish a competitive domestic supply chain,
    supplement conventional mining methods, and reduce nickel imports. Managed by
    the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), this effort supports  President
    Biden’s Investing in America agenda to strengthen domestic critical materials
    supply chains, enhance our economic and national security, and meet the growing
    demand for critical materials needed to ensure America leads the world in the
    emerging clean energy economy.'

    energy targets, and support our economy and national security, it’s going to take
    all-hands-on-deck approach and innovative solutions,” **said ARPA-E Director Evelyn
    N. Wang.** “By exploring phytomining to extract nickel as the first target critical
    material, ARPA-E aims to achieve a cost-competitive and low-carbon footprint extraction
    approach needed to support the energy transition.”

    (CMA), nickel serves as an ideal target to validate the viability of phytomining
    in the U.S. due to the large number of documented nickel hyperaccumulation (HA)
    plants. Nickel is used in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries present in electric
    vehicles, consumer electronics, stationary storage, stainless steel, metallurgy,
    coatings, electroplating, and other alloys. Nickel is crucial to global clean
    energy technology supply chains and future demand is expected to grow.

    seeks to spur the technological development of phytomining in the United States
    that could complement current and future domestic sources of nickel and catalyze
    phytomining of critical minerals beyond nickel.

    of plant traits that enable the accumulation of nickel at an enhanced rate. ARPA-E
    envisions these projects as early-stage proof-of-concepts likely to take place
    in closed or open-air laboratories, greenhouses, or confined fields where light,
    humidity, and temperature regimes can be fully programmed.
