- en: Tesla will recall 3,878 Cybertrucks on Friday, according to a [report](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V276-7026.PDF)
    from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Those vehicles
    have a defect in which the pad on top of the pedal can slip off and get wedged
    into the interior trim causing unintended acceleration. This defect is due to
    a lubricant that was used during the assembly process in order to make it easier
    to attach the pad to the pedal. Unfortunately, it appears that this workaround
    also makes it easier for the pad to become detached from the pedal.

    for free. Tesla has already begun addressing the defect in production and will
    apply the fix to trucks already at delivery centers.

    owners [posting about it on social media](https://gizmodo.com/tesla-cybertruck-hit-with-stop-sale-because-of-unintend-1851410669).
    Last week, Tesla put a hold on sales of the Cybertruck as it investigated the
    problem. According to the NHTSA, there have been no reports of death or injuries
    due to the defect.

    reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg&t=1s) to people’s driveways
    [last December](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-makes-first-deliveries-cybertruck-price-range-1851062357).
    Its “unique” design with a sticker price starting at just over $80,000 has resulted
    in [one embarrassing moment after another](https://gizmodo.com/cybertruck-drivers-humiliating-themselves-are-the-bigge-1851320392).
    Musk, on the other hand, seems to be more focused on getting a [$55 billion compensation
    package](https://jalopnik.com/tesla-creates-website-to-convince-shareholders-to-make-1851421233)
    from shareholders.
