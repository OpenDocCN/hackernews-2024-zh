  zh: 苹果的清算始于法庭。2020年，Epic Games对苹果和谷歌的应用商店做法提起诉讼 — 尤其是苹果帮助建立的30%佣金作为行业标准。法院基本上支持了苹果，但通过要求应用开发者允许向用户告知外部支付选项，给了Epic一个小胜利。然后，在2022年，[欧盟引入立法](/2022/3/24/22994234/eu-antitrust-legislation-dma-digital-markets-act-details)试图遏制大科技公司的权力，包括苹果在内。苹果响应压力，[承诺在iPhone上支持RCS](/2023/11/16/23964171/apple-iphone-rcs-support)

    lawsuit against Apple](/2024/3/21/24105363/apple-doj-monopoly-lawsuit) for operating
    an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market. The legal process is just starting,
    and when it eventually happens, the trial seems likely to drag on for years into
    the future. The DOJ’s antitrust case against Microsoft was introduced in 1998;
    appeals stretched into 2007.

    but for Apple, the past five years have amounted to an enormous pressure buildup
    — and it’s not stopping. Apple could have had more control over its destiny by
    opening up its services earlier, but it didn’t. Now, it’s being forced to react
    to regulation, creating different rules for iOS in different regions of the world.

    than I could possibly recall or count. And over the years, I’ve seen them get
    faster, more reliable, and harder to distinguish from one another. A new technology
    can’t wow us forever; eventually, it’s everywhere. History has shown us that one
    company can only claim dominance over that technology for so long — and the bigger
    it gets, the more energy it takes to maintain it.
