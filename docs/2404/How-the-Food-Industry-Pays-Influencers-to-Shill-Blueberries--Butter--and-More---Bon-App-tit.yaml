- en: The research side of the checkoff world has yielded a surprising array of food
    innovations, like [Egg Beaters](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/C5BN9bLtpHgEz2yTuLXF5DdPiDNjp7KdytfbCn7t9pMLo7Jp1GGuLcfBi3weknTrGqBpjquirhGWBFvYjQh9hTxmy3J8NoMHmSLrP9hY3N9R3nfrZxsvEKTAD1Gys5wXt8B2xWsS15yqKJV11LTAh2F81CyJYzjr9kBGmH5FjSHKPutzVDrqH3Z),
    the pre-cracked eggs in a milk carton-esque container that was developed with
    the help of the American Egg Board. Some checkoff boards have taken a more branded
    approach to developing consumer products that use as much of their respective
    commodity as possible. The beef and dairy lobbies, for instance, have used their
    budgets to help devise fast food Frankensteins like Taco Bell’s Grilled Stuft
    Burrito, Domino’s Philly Cheese Steak Pizza, and Pizza Hut’s 3-Cheese Stuffed
    Crust Pizza, [according to historian Sarah Milov](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/abs/promoting-agriculture-farmers-the-state-and-checkoff-marketing-19352005/C0A8ACC8A906BE3FB9848DB06091858D).
    And in 2007, the national dairy checkoff not only [worked with Domino’s to create
    pizzas](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/us/07fat.html) that used 40% more cheese,
    it paid for [the advertising campaign behind them](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/documents-on-marketing-cheese#document/p14).

  zh: 筹码世界的研究方面产生了许多令人惊讶的食品创新，比如[Egg Beaters](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/C5BN9bLtpHgEz2yTuLXF5DdPiDNjp7KdytfbCn7t9pMLo7Jp1GGuLcfBi3weknTrGqBpjquirhGWBFvYjQh9hTxmy3J8NoMHmSLrP9hY3N9R3nfrZxsvEKTAD1Gys5wXt8B2xWsS15yqKJV11LTAh2F81CyJYzjr9kBGmH5FjSHKPutzVDrqH3Z)，这是一种事先打散的鸡蛋，采用了类似牛奶盒子的容器，是由美国鸡蛋委员会的帮助下开发出来的。一些筹码委员会已经采取了更加品牌化的方式开发消费者产品，尽可能地利用各自商品的大部分内容。例如，牛肉和乳制品游说团体利用它们的预算帮助设计快餐怪物，比如塔可贝尔的烤布里扎饼，达美乐的费城芝士牛排披萨和必胜客的三层芝士馅饼，[据历史学家莎拉·米洛夫说](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/abs/promoting-agriculture-farmers-the-state-and-checkoff-marketing-19352005/C0A8ACC8A906BE3FB9848DB06091858D)，国家乳制品筹码在2007年不仅与达美乐合作创造了使用40%更多芝士的披萨，还支付了[它们背后的广告宣传活动](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/documents-on-marketing-cheese#document/p14)。
- en: Now, as media has evolved, so has checkoff board advertising. Unlike a celebrity
    spokesperson in the ’90s print ads who may not have had particularly strong opinions
    about, say, milk or beef, many influencers say they only promote products that
    they personally believe in. Sammi Haber Brondo, a registered dietitian who’s worked
    with a number of produce boards, including Potatoes USA, told me that she follows
    strict criteria for her influencing campaigns. “If I wasn’t aligned with the product,
    I would not work with it,” she says. “It has to align with me and my nutrition
    philosophy as a dietitian with a private practice and as someone who has a social
    media platform.”

  zh: 现在，随着媒体的发展，筹码委员会的广告也在发展。与上世纪90年代印刷广告中可能对牛奶或牛肉没有特别强烈意见的名人代言人不同，许多影响者表示他们只推广他们个人真正信任的产品。与多个产品委员会（包括美国土豆委员会）合作过的注册营养师萨米·哈伯·布隆多告诉我，她对自己的影响力活动有严格的标准。“如果我与产品不一致，我就不会与之合作，”她说。“它必须与我以私人实践中的营养师以及作为具有社交媒体平台的人的营养哲学一致。”
- en: All the influencers who talked to me spoke genuinely about their appreciation
    of the various foods they had promoted. Melissa Harrison, who owns Montana-based
    catering service [Seasonal Montana](https://www.instagram.com/seasonalmontana/),
    says that she has worked with Potatoes USA due to her genuine love of that versatile
    tuber. “I cherish the potato,” she says. “It’s so universal. Everybody loves potatoes.”

  zh: 所有与我交谈的影响者都真诚地谈到了他们对所推广的各种食物的赞赏。梅利莎·哈里森，拥有蒙大拿州餐饮服务公司[季节性蒙大拿](https://www.instagram.com/seasonalmontana/)的所有者，说她之所以与美国土豆委员会合作，是因为她真正热爱这种多用途的块茎。她说：“我珍视土豆。它是如此普遍。每个人都喜欢土豆。”
- en: But the boom in social media advertising for foods has drawn criticism, usually
    toward boards with big budgets like beef, pork, and dairy. Democratic Senator
    Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah recently [introduced
    a bill](https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-introduces-bill-to-protect-farmers-and-ranchers)
    in hopes of reforming the boards, which they argue [don’t even help smaller farms](https://ambrook.com/research/legislation/checkoff-reform-usda-beef-dairy-corn)
    and [sometimes participate](https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/4153570-got-milk-checkoff-program-fairness-farming/)
    in “wasteful, anti-competitive, and deceptive behavior.” For example, one complaint
    is that partnerships with fast-food companies (as the Dairy Board has done with
    Domino’s and Pizza Hut) only benefit big, industrial dairy companies. (Several
    trade groups that work with checkoff boards have widely denied accusations that
    they misuse money.)

  zh: 但社交媒体上食品广告的激增引发了批评，通常针对像牛肉、猪肉和乳制品等预算庞大的委员会。新泽西州民主党参议员科里·布克和犹他州共和党参议员迈克·李最近[提出了一项法案](https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-introduces-bill-to-protect-farmers-and-ranchers)，希望改革这些委员会，他们认为这些委员会甚至不帮助小农场，有时还[参与](https://ambrook.com/research/legislation/checkoff-reform-usda-beef-dairy-corn)“浪费、反竞争和欺骗性行为”。例如，有一项投诉是，与快餐公司合作（就像乳制品委员会与Domino's和Pizza
    Hut合作）只有大型工业乳品公司受益。（几个与检验委员会合作的贸易团体广泛否认他们滥用资金的指控。）
- en: Many checkoff programs also [take a subtle approach](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/27/the-federal-governments-role-in-those-tiktok-ads-for-milk-and-pork-00138178)
    as they seek to target younger consumers—and some critics say that a government-endorsed
    program shouldn’t feature advertisements that could counter overall wellness.
    Unlike other forms of influencing, ads from checkoff groups are technically no
    different from government PSAs like [Smokey Bear](https://smokeybear.com/) or
    [McGruff the Crime Dog](https://mcgruff.org/). It doesn’t quite mean, “The government
    wants them to say it,” clarifies Helen Norton, a law professor at the University
    of Colorado Boulder. But it does basically mean, “The government is willing to
    support it.” That may be fine and good when it comes to sheet-pan salmon with
    potatoes and peas, a [recipe](https://www.sammibrondo.com/blog/spring-sheet-pan-salmon-potatoes-and-snap-peas)
    that one dietitian and influencer worked on with Potatoes USA. But a [beef burger
    with bacon jam](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celebrity-chef-josh-capon-shares-recipes-to-beef-up-the-fourth-301323738.html),
    as celebrity chef Josh Capon developed with the beef board as part of another
    campaign, raises questions.

  zh: 许多检验项目也采用了一种微妙的方法，旨在吸引年轻消费者，并且一些批评者称，政府支持的项目不应该展示可能对整体健康产生负面影响的广告。与其他形式的影响力不同，检验小组的广告在技术上与政府的公益广告如[Smokey
    Bear](https://smokeybear.com/)或[McGruff the Crime Dog](https://mcgruff.org/)没有什么不同。如科罗拉多大学博尔德分校的法学教授海伦·诺顿澄清的那样，这并不完全意味着“政府希望他们这么说”，但基本上意味着“政府愿意支持它”。这在谈到用薯片烤三文鱼、土豆和豌豆的[食谱](https://www.sammibrondo.com/blog/spring-sheet-pan-salmon-potatoes-and-snap-peas)时可能是合理且良好的。但像名厨乔什·卡彭与牛肉委员会共同开发的含培根果酱的[牛肉汉堡](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celebrity-chef-josh-capon-shares-recipes-to-beef-up-the-fourth-301323738.html)，作为另一个活动的一部分，引发了一些问题。
