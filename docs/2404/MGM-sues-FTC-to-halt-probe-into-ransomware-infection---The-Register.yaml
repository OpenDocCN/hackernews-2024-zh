- en: MGM Resorts wants the FTC to halt a probe into last year's ransomware infection
    at the mega casino chain – because the watchdog's boss Lina Khan was a guest at
    one of its hotels during the cyberattack.

    the US regulator and its chair, noting the computer network intrusion in September
    2023 "cost MGM dearly." That legal complaint, filed in a Washington DC federal
    district court, demands among other things an end to the regulator's investigation
    into the malware infection unless Khan is recused from the probe, and a declaration
    that the watchdog acted unconstitutionally.

    from the attack. It presumably would rather the FTC not add to that pain with
    fines or some other punishment stemming from scrutiny of the corporation's IT
    practices.

    figure at its Las Vegas hotel during the attack," the lawsuit claimed, meaning
    Khan, who was said to be at the Sin City resort during the infection.'

    the MGM digital break-in as well as a similar intrusion at Caesars Entertainment
    hotels and resorts. The miscreants, we're told, bragged that all it took to break
    into MGM's networks was a 10-minute call tricking some sap on the IT help desk.

    some of its key IT systems after detecting the intruders. Because of this, an
    MGM employee apparently asked FTC boss Lina Khan to write her credit card information
    on paper upon check in at its Vegas hotel. Khan then, it is said, asked the desk
    employee how MGM was managing data security in light of the breach, and the worker
    said he didn't know.

- en: Shortly after Khan's stay, the FTC initiated a "wide-reaching" investigation
    into MGM, and has since asked the resort owner to produce "more than 100 categories
    of information," the lawsuit claimed. Some of these requests are "seemingly derived
    directly from Chair Khan's personal experience in transacting business with MGM
    during the attack," it added.

    reports about Khan and her aide being hotel guests, and led to a slew of private
    lawsuits against the business, according to MGM's attorneys.  "Specifically, it
    is now a defendant in fifteen consumer class actions."

    that Khan recuse herself because of her personal involvement in the case. The
    FTC denied this request.

    an appearance of a conflict of interest, and upon information and belief, an actual
    conflict of interest," according to the lawsuit.'
