    on Thursday that claims Amazon’s top execs used Signal’s disappearing messages
    feature to destroy evidence relevant [to the agency’s massive antitrust lawsuit](/2023/9/26/23809817/amazon-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit-monopoly).
    (You remember the one? The FTC accused Amazon of creating a secret “Project Nessie”
    pricing algorithm that may have generated [more than $1 billion in extra profits](/2023/11/2/23943724/amazon-project-nessie-algorithm-ftc-antitrust-case).)

    (which is owned by Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos) reports that Amazon
    is just one of several companies recently accused of turning to encrypted messaging
    apps like Signal that can permanently erase messages automatically.

    Amazon called the FTC’s contentions “baseless,” saying that “Amazon voluntarily
    disclosed employees’ limited Signal use to the FTC years ago, thoroughly collected
    Signal conversations from its employees’ phones, and allowed agency staff to inspect
    those conversations even when they had nothing to do with the FTC’s investigation.”

- en: The FTC’s lawyers say Bezos, current CEO Andy Jassy, general counsel David Zapolsky,
    former CEO of worldwide operations Dave Clark, and other execs are all Signal
    users. Bezos is identified in the document as “a heavy Signal user” who instructed
    others to use the app, although [the 2018 hacking of his personal cellphone](/2020/1/23/21078828/report-saudi-arabia-hack-jeff-bezos-phone-fti-consulting)
    may be part of the reason for that.

- en: And because Amazon didn’t instruct employees to preserve messages sent in the
    app until more than 15 months after it was notified of the investigation, the
    FTC argues, “It is highly likely that relevant information has been destroyed
    as a result of Amazon’s actions and inactions.”

- en: The FTC lawyers are pursuing discovery into Amazon’s efforts to preserve documents
    so they can figure out just how much information might be missing. Despite requests
    last fall for relevant documents about what advice Amazon gave to employees about
    ephemeral apps, the FTC claims that Amazon has so far refused to produce much
    of what was requested. If the judge finds that Amazon was negligent in failing
    to preserve data tied to the case, it could face sanctions, and things could get
    worse if the judge finds the failures [were intentional](/2023/12/1/23984902/judge-james-donato-investigate-google).
