Man talk about how time is a flat circle.

2005: “YGBFKM I’m not waiting four days for a physical DVD to watch this movie.” [MPAA freaks out about piracy]

2015: “Eh why bother with slimy torrent sites when Netflix charges a fair price for a pretty good catalog.” [MPAA is silent]

2024: “YGBFKM I’m not signing up for some impossible-to-cancel monthly subscription just to watch *The Best of Both Worlds* while my wife is at dinner with friends. Oh, wow, it won't even deliver 5.1 surround sound to me unless I use [tiny list of 'approved devices' that actually may or may not work, because the list is five years old, has never been updated, and includes stuff that isn't even made anymore] and I can't watch it on an airplane, and it has ads now (didn't I pay to not have ads; oh apparently 'unskippable ads for other movies' aren't 'ads' got it) and the player interface sucks so much that I have to play a game of Sharp Shooter with the mouse to grab the two-pixel-wide seek handle, and the arrow keys don't even seek at all, and turning subtitles on and off requires digging through six-layer-deep submenus, and the compression is so bad that despite being '4K' it looks 100x worse than a BluRay. Oh, wow this 1gbit fiber connection sure is fast when it connects to twenty peers.” [MPAA freaks out about piracy]
