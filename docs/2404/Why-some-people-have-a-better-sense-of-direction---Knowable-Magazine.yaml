    to place, David Uttal is a poor navigator. “When I was 13 years old, I got lost
    on a Boy Scout hike, and I was lost for two and a half days,” recalls the Northwestern
    University cognitive scientist. And he’s still bad at finding his way around.

    always seem to know exactly where they are and how to get where they want to go.
    Scientists sometimes measure navigational ability by asking someone to point toward
    an out-of-sight location — or, more challenging, to imagine they are someplace
    else and point in the direction of a third location — and it’s immediately obvious
    that some people are better at it than others.

    in the 2022 *Annual Review of Developmental Psychology*. But others, when asked
    to indicate the target’s direction, seem to point at random. “They have literally
    no idea where it is.”

    much harder for scientists to explain why. There’s new excitement brewing in the
    navigation research world, though. By leveraging technologies such as virtual
    reality and GPS tracking, scientists have been able to watch hundreds, sometimes
    even millions, of people trying to find their way through complex spaces, and
    to measure how well they do. Though there’s still much to learn, the research
    suggests that to some extent, navigation skills are shaped by upbringing.

    the role of genetics in navigation. In 2020, Margherita Malanchini, a developmental
    psychologist at Queen Mary University of London, and her colleagues compared the
    performance of more than 2,600 identical and nonidentical twins as they navigated
    through a virtual environment, to test [whether navigational ability runs in families](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-020-0067-8).
    It does, they found — but only modestly. Instead, the biggest contributor to people’s
    performance was what geneticists call the “nonshared environment” — that is, the
    unique experiences each person accumulates as their life unfolds. Good navigators,
    it appears, are mostly made, not born.

    at University College London, gave researchers a glimpse at how experience and
    other cultural factors might influence wayfinding skills. Spiers and his colleagues,
    in collaboration with the telecom company T-Mobile, developed a game for cellphones
    and tablets, *Sea Hero Quest*, in which players navigate by boat through a virtual
    environment to locate a series of checkpoints. The game app asked participants
    to provide basic demographic data, and nearly 4 million worldwide did so. (The
    app is no longer accepting new participants except by invitation of researchers.)

    the total distance each player traveled to reach all the checkpoints. After completing
    some levels of the game, players also had to shoot a flare back toward their point
    of origin — a dead-reckoning test analogous to the pointing-to-out-of-sight-locations
    task. Then Spiers and his colleagues could compare players’ performance to the
    demographic data.

    they found. People from Nordic countries tended to be slightly better navigators,
    perhaps because the sport of orienteering, which combines cross-country running
    and navigation, is popular in those countries. Country folk did better, on average,
    than people from cities. And among city-dwellers, those from cities with more
    chaotic street networks such as those in the older parts of European cities did
    better than those from cities like Chicago, where the streets form a regular grid,
    perhaps because residents of grid cities don’t need to build such complex mental
    maps.'

    of the biggest determinants of how well they navigate. Indeed, experience may
    even underlie one of the most consistent findings — and clichés — in navigation:
    that men tend to perform better than women. Turns out this gender gap is more
    a question of culture and experience than of innate ability.'

    no gender difference in navigation. In contrast, men far outperform women in places
    where women face cultural restrictions on exploring their environment on their

    studies of the Tsimane, a traditional Indigenous community in the Bolivian Amazon.
    Anthropologist Helen Elizabeth Davis of Arizona State University and her colleagues
    put GPS trackers on 305 Tsimane adults to measure their daily movements over a
    three-day period, and found no difference in the distance moved by men and women.
    [Men and women also were equally adept at pointing to out-of-sight locations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12602),
    they reported in *Topics in Cognitive Science*. Even children performed extremely
    well at this navigation task — a result, Davis thinks, of growing up in a culture
    that encourages children to range widely and explore the forest.

    more cautious about exploring, for good reasons of personal safety. Not only do
    they gather less experience at navigating, but nervousness about security or getting
    lost also has a direct effect on navigation. “Anxiety gets in the way of good
    navigation, so if you’re worried about your personal safety, you’re a poor navigator,”
    says Newcombe.

    “To get good at navigating, you have to be willing to explore,” says Uttal. “Some
    people do not enjoy the experience of wandering, and others enjoy it very much.”

    people who play a lot of video games, many of which involve exploring virtual

    nudge some people toward activities that involve navigation, while those who are
    temperamentally less inclined to explore, who have less opportunity to wander
    or who have an initial bad experience may be less likely to engage in activities
    that require exploration. It all snowballs from there, Uttal speculates. “I think
    a combination of personality and ability pushes you in certain directions. It’s
    a developmental cascade.”

    hallmarks of [good navigators](https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/society/2021/reading-pacific-navigators-mysterious-map).
    These include the ability to estimate how far you’ve traveled, to read and remember
    maps (both printed and mental), to learn routes based on a sequence of landmarks
    and to understand where points are relative to one another.

    by using landmarks — for example, turn left at the gas station, then go three
    blocks and turn right just past the red house — and what’s often termed “survey
    knowledge,” the ability to build and consult a mental map of a place.'

    well at it once they’ve taken a route a few times, says [Dan Montello](https://www.geog.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/dan-montello),
    a geographer and psychologist also at UC Santa Barbara. In a classic experiment
    from almost two decades ago, Montello’s student Toru Ishikawa drove 24 volunteers,
    once a week for 10 weeks, on two twisting routes in a tony residential area of
    Santa Barbara that they’d never visited before.

    each route and roughly estimate the distance travelled between them. But [they
    varied widely in their ability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010028505000733)
    to identify shortcuts between the two routes, point to landmarks not visible from
    where they stood, or sketch a map of the routes. Those who couldn’t identify shortcuts
    or find landmarks may suffer from an inability to create accurate mental maps,
    the researchers think.

    the importance of such mental maps in navigation. They asked 294 volunteers to
    use a mouse and computer screen to navigate along two routes through a virtual
    town. Once the volunteers had learned the routes and the landmarks they contained,
    the researchers asked them to stand at one landmark and point to others on both
    routes.

    Some people had formed a good mental map: They could point accurately to landmarks
    on both the same and different routes. Others had good route knowledge but struggled
    to create an integrated map: They were good at pointing within a route, but poor
    between routes. A third group was poor at all the pointing tasks.'

    — goes a long way toward explaining why they’re better navigators, Montello says.
    “When the only skill you have is the ability to think in terms of routes, you
    can’t be creative to get around barriers.” Survey knowledge gives the ability
    to navigate creatively, he says. “That’s a pretty stunning difference.”

    choosing the most appropriate navigational strategy for the situation they find
    themselves in, says cognitive neuroscientist Weisberg, now at the University of

    when more sophisticated calculations are needed.

    of alternate strategies,” Weisberg says. “And they’re doing so in a much more

    themselves in a new situation, they’re better able to find their way.”

    knowledge, or whether some of the lost might be failing at other navigational
    subskills instead, such as remembering landmarks or estimating distance traveled.
    Either way, what can poor navigators do to improve? That’s still an open question.
    “We all have our pet theories,” says [Elizabeth Chrastil](https://cnlm.uci.edu/chrastil/),

    “We can improve people’s navigational abilities in virtual environments,” says
    Arne Ekstrom, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Arizona. It takes
    about two weeks to show fairly dramatic gains — but it’s not yet clear whether
    people are really becoming better navigators or just getting better at finding
    their way through the particular virtual environments used in the experiments.

    studies of what happens when people *stop* using their navigation skills. In a
    2020 study published in *Scientific Reports*, for example, neuroscientists Louisa
    Dahmani and Véronique Bohbot of McGill University in Montreal recruited 50 young
    adults and questioned them about their lifetime experience of driving with GPS.
    Then they tested the volunteers in a virtual world that required them to navigate
    without GPS. The [heaviest GPS users did worse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62877-0),

    the most during the intervening period experienced greater declines in their ability
    to navigate without GPS, strongly suggesting that GPS reliance causes diminished
    skills, rather than poor skills leading to greater GPS use.

    closer attention to compass directions or prominent landmarks as a way to integrate
    their movements into a mental map. For Weisberg, the only way he learns spaces
    in an integrated way is by paying attention to major cardinal directions or prominent
    landmarks like the ocean. “The more attention I pay, the better I can link things
    to the map in my head.” He recommends that struggling navigators ask themselves
    which way is north 10 times a day, referring to a map if necessary. This, he suggests,
    could help them move beyond mere route knowledge.
