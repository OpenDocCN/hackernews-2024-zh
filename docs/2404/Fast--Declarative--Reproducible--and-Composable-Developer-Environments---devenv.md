> 来源：[https://devenv.sh/](https://devenv.sh/)

Pre-configured processes

Services define processes that are started when the service is enabled as part of `devenv up`.

Configuration

Each service provides a number of options how to configure it and a hook to pass extra configuration, whatever the format.

Extendable

Define your development processes as a service, allowing reuse and simplicity of a few lines of configuration.
