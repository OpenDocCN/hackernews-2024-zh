# Discovering the XZ Backdoor with Andres Freund / Oxide

> 来源：[https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1843393](https://oxide.computer/podcasts/oxide-and-friends/1843393)

Andres Freund joined Bryan and Adam to talk about his discovery of the xz backdoor. It’s an incredible story… so great to get into the details with Andres. We started by ranting about the coverage in the New York Times… coverage that explicitly refused to dig into the details! It’s all the more shocking because the big story here is how Andres’ penchant for digging into the details is what saved us all from what would have been a pervasive and damaging attack!
