- en: Seven years ago, a cyberattack left many of the most popular websites based
    in the United States inaccessible. For three extended periods on October 21, 2016,
    internet users were left without their doses of Twitter, CNN and Netflix among
    other popular sites.

    caused such a disruption. But the incident was not conducted by a hostile state.
    It turned out to be extremely unsophisticated, just a distributed-denial-of-service
    attack targeting Dyn, a company which provided Domain Name System (DNS) services
    — a critical part of the internet’s communications structure.

- en: While the attack was unsophisticated, it was large. The volume of traffic sent
    to Dyn’s servers was generated by a botnet of internet-connected consumer devices
    from wireless cameras through to WiFi routers. The botnet, named [Mirai](https://therecord.media/tag/mirai)
    after a Japanese cartoon, had been developed by a trio of U.S. citizens barely
    out of their teens, all of whom were soon arrested.

    just over a year later, their invention raised the specter of something much more
    long-lasting — the specter of just how much harm could be caused by sloppy security
    practices among Internet of Things (IoT) producers, particularly the widespread
    use of default usernames and passwords that allowed the Mirai botnet to automatically
    infect them and spread itself to around 300,000 devices, all of which could be
    ordered to target anything else connected to the internet.

    risks to the home and business networks they’re connected to. In [one often-cited
    case](https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/19/technology/fish-tank-hack-darktrace/index.html)
    described by cybersecurity company Darktrace, hackers were allegedly able to steal
    data from a casino’s otherwise well-protected computer network after breaking
    in through an internet-connected temperature sensor in a fish tank.

    “12345” are explicitly banned, and manufacturers are also required to publish
    contact details so users can report bugs.

    one and ensure shoppers can easily find information on how long their devices
