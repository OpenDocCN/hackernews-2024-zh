- en: A text time-stamped 1:19 a.m. early Wednesday read, “I think it’s over, man.”
    It was a Los Angeles–based colleague at [The Messenger](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2024/01/the-messenger-to-shut-down-jimmy-finklestein-tells-staff.html).
    He’d received an unanticipated direct deposit and the sum totaled his unused vacation
    days. I guess in addition to good weather they have some solid labor laws in California.
    In New York City, I was laid off without additional pay. Plus it was raining.

    The Messenger, you’ll have to take me at my word. The website is [a blank white
    page](https://themessenger.com) now — the most terrifying image for any writer
    — with just the company’s name and an email address. I doubt any correspondence
    sent there will be returned.

- en: I knew taking the position was a roll of the dice. It was a start-up and the
    CEO, Jimmy Finkelstein, had already been [mocked](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/05/jimmy-finkelstein-the-messenger-hot-seat)
    for making grand statements at the website’s launch, comparing it to *Vanity Fair*
    and *60 Minutes*. Still, I was told there would be freedom to get creative with
    how I wanted to cover movies. Though I have bylines everywhere, it’s been a while
    since I had a staff position. Sure, this Finkelstein character seemed a little
    questionable (my God, his wife came up with Melania’s [Be Best](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/30/publishers-wife-played-undisclosed-role-for-melania-trump-345053)
    campaign), but they were offering a dental plan. I took the job in late June,
    already a crisis or two deep into the company’s short life.

    Godfrey Reggio, a very funny back-and-forth with Cord Jefferson, and a review
    of *Barbie* that included extra commentary from Amy Taubin, which went [a bit
    viral](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8207-does-barbie-get-away-with-it).
    But it was clear, pretty much on day one, that in addition to writing with an
    authoritative and articulate voice with over 15 years’ experience, I would be
    expected to help shovel the furnaces with SEO coal. I was happy to pitch in. But
    I soon recognized that time-consuming reporting or rich critical essays were less
    valued by upper management than quick hits. I’ll never forget the day I was told,
    breathlessly, by the then-head of the entertainment channel that Toni Collette
    was trending. (*Trending, I say, trending! Do you hear me? Toni Collette is trending!!!*
    I believe it was her birthday.)

    I dashed off something to the tune of “8 Toni Collette Performances You Need to
    See” and was sure to shout-out *About a Boy* and the *Nightmare Alley* remake
    that was somehow nominated for a Best Picture Oscar even though no one watched
    it. (It’s pretty enjoyable!) If I may be so bold, I wrote a damn good article
    about Toni Collette. But even working at supersonic speeds, by the time I finished,
    Toni Collette wasn’t trending anymore. Heck of a way to run a business.

- en: Anyway, with that 1 a.m. text in my head Wednesday morning, I still had to go
    to work. Someone needed to review the movie *Argylle*. Going to work meant moving
    from my bedroom to a chair in the living room, because that’s how media is these
    days. Despite this obvious fact, The Messenger’s executives — masters at long-term
    thinking — rented the entire 26th floor of a skyscraper downtown. It is an enormous
    space and, the few times I visited, was nine-tenths empty. Just rows and rows
    of spotless, expensive-looking desks that could rise to a standing work station
    with the push of a button.

    now, I’ll just say Bryce Dallas Howard is a peach, but the picture is lousy.)
    On Slack, the West Coast employees (including my marvelous editor, a creative
    and sharp individual) were waking up to their newfound riches, realizing this
    was not a late Christmas bonus. Chaos ensued.

    and we even had channel-specific Zooms with Finkelstein. (Though never a town-hall-style
    address. Not once, ever.) Our editor-in-chief, Dan Wakeford, even emerged from
    the shadows to appear at these Zooms. Not that he talked much. I can’t offer a
    real opinion of this man I’ve never formally met.

- en: Oddly, I did meet Finkelstein once. We had the saddest Christmas party — some
    hummus tubs from Fresh Direct in the break room. He shambled over like Boris Karloff
    to shake my hand. I mentioned something about the hummus and someone else mentioned
    that hummus was topical that day because of the Israel-Hamas war (actually [couscous](https://forward.com/fast-forward/573434/yale-israeli-couscous-cultural-appropriation-gaza-war/)
    was in the news), and then Finkelstein barked that he would never let his kids
    go to an Ivy League school today, an apparent reference to the antisemitism controversies.
    This represents the entirety of my interaction with Jimmy Finkelstein, a very
    wealthy man who decided not to give his employees severance.

    out it was the company’s then-president [Richard Beckman](https://nypost.com/1999/09/22/muzzle-for-mad-dog-conde-nast-will-pay-seven-figures-to-settle-assault-suit/).
    I’d never seen him in a Zoom so I didn’t know what he looked like. He seemed like
    a cheery guy, actually. I told him to go see *The Holdovers*. A few days later
    he quit the company.

    Zoom 上，所以不知道他长什么样。他看起来挺开朗的，事实上。我告诉他去看 *The Holdovers*。几天后，他就辞职了。
- en: By midday Wednesday, everyone realized no news was coming from management, so
    we all shared photos of our pets on Slack. A colleague wrote that he was spending
    on a trip to Las Vegas to cover the Super Bowl. Would he be reimbursed? Another
    worried about an upcoming surgery she had planned. Would she still have medical
    coverage?

  zh: 到了周三中午，大家意识到管理层没有任何消息，所以我们都在 Slack 上分享我们宠物的照片。一位同事写道，他打算去拉斯维加斯报道超级碗。他会得到报销吗？另一位担心她即将进行的手术。她还能享受医疗保险吗？
- en: Then, finally, after 4 p.m. the New York *Times*’s [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/media/the-messenger-jimmy-finkelstein.html)
    about The Messenger shutting down hit. Wakeford made a rare slack appearance to
    say “[I am not in the loop](https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1752871199913242826).”
    Soon thereafter, we were shut out of Slack. An email arrived afterward from “CEO
    Communications” in which Finkelstein apologized to us for failing to raise more
    capital. Later, all our work was deleted. Thousands of stories and hundreds of
    my own. Some of them were great.

    The Messenger 停止运营传开了。韦克福德难得露面，说“[我不在内部消息中](https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1752871199913242826)”。不久之后，我们被从
    Slack 中踢出来。稍后，我们收到了一封来自“CEO通讯”的邮件，芬克尔斯坦在邮件中向我们道歉，因为未能筹集更多资金。后来，我们所有的工作都被删除了。成千上万篇文章，还有数百篇我自己的。其中一些很棒。
