    我们做到了。这真的起到了作用。'

- en: Then we have a layered approach. The property we purchased does come with a
    substantial amount of groundwater and surface water rights from both the aquifer
    and the river. That’s likely enough for 50,000, maybe even 100,000 people. And
    then we're going to layer it by importing water from outside of the county.

- en: 'My favorite example is: There''s an almond orchard on the north side of Travis
    that was planted when almond prices were higher in 2016, in very marginal grounds
    that don’t produce many almonds. That orchard isn''t popular for a variety of
    reasons. Number one, it attracts birds, which create hazards for Travis. Number
    two, it was built by ripping up a big portion of the Jepson Prairie, which is
    a very unique ecosystem.'

  zh: 我最喜欢的例子是：特拉维斯北侧有一片杏仁果园，2016年杏仁价格较高时种植在非常边缘的土地上，几乎不生产杏仁。由于多种原因，这片果园并不受欢迎。首先，它吸引鸟类，给特拉维斯带来了危险。其次，它是通过铲除杰普森草原的一大部分建造起来的，而那是一个非常独特的生态系统。
- en: People who care about the environment would love it turned back into pasture
    so that tiger salamanders and vernal pools can come back. Right now it uses about
    four acre-feet of water per acre. That’s about 10,000 acre-feet of water — the
    land is 2,500 acres. Our average consumption will be probably about a quarter
    of an acre per household. So it’s enough water for 40,000 households at two and
    a half people per household.

  zh: 关心环境的人们希望这片土地重新变成牧场，这样虎纹蝾螈和春池可以再次出现。目前每英亩大约消耗四英亩英尺的水。这大约是1万英亩英尺的水 —— 这片土地有2500英亩。我们的平均消耗可能每户大约四分之一英亩。因此，这足够供给40,000户家庭，每户平均有2.5个人。
- en: That’s enough water for 100,000 people just from that orchard. If we just rip
    it out and replace it with pasture, the rare species can come back. The vernal
    pools can come back. Travis is better off because they don’t have a hazard risk
    from birds. And we have lots of water for lots of new residents. And so I think
    that’s a really good example of the kind of win-win-win all around that can happen
    on that orchard.

  zh: 这仅仅是来自那片果园的水就足够供给10万人。如果我们只是将果园铲除，然后改种牧场，那些稀有物种可以回来。春池可以再次出现。特拉维斯因为不再有鸟类带来的风险而更加安全。我们有大量水供应给许多新居民。因此，我认为这真是一个能在那片果园中实现多赢局面的很好例子。
