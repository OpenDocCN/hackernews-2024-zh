  zh: Updated Internet-scraping outfit Spy.pet claims to have harvested more than
    four billion public messages made by nearly 620 million users on more than 14,000
    Discord chat servers – and is selling access to this trove.
- en: The service (for a lack of a better word) has been active since November 2023,
    vacuuming up user and server activity without any sign of an opt-out. Yes, all
    the info is already public in a way – Discord is kinda like IRC on steroids –
    and it's a reminder that it's not impossible to gather up all this chatter using
    bots for various purposes (if not surveillance then training AI models.)
  id: totrans-split-7

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这项（缺乏更好描述的）服务自2023年11月开始运作，无需用户选择即擅自收集用户和服务器活动。是的，所有这些信息在某种程度上已经公开了——Discord有点像是增强版的IRC——这提醒我们，通过各种目的（若非监视则为训练AI模型）使用机器人收集所有这些聊天并非不可能。
- en: The website presents the data it's collected in several ways. Each known user
    has a profile, which contains all known aliases, pronouns, connected accounts
    to other platforms such as Steam and GitHub, Discord servers joined, and public
    messages. If you wanted to quite literally spy on a Discord user or users, Spy.pet
    lets you do that, for a fee.

  zh: 该网站以多种方式呈现其收集到的数据。每个已知用户都有一个包含所有已知别名、代词、连接到其他平台（如Steam和GitHub）、加入的Discord服务器及公开消息的档案。如果你确实想要直接监视Discord用户或用户群，Spy.pet允许你这样做，但需支付费用。
- en: Indeed perusing the privacy-smashing website's database isn't free. Users have
    to buy credits to look up profiles, access archives of conversations, and search
    for servers without having to sit through a cool-down time. Each credit costs
    one cent, and as a user profile costs ten credits to access (seven for cached
    profiles), it costs just a tenth of a dollar to look someone up. Of course, Spy.pet
    only takes cryptocurrency for payments.

  zh: 实际上，这家侵犯隐私的网站要求用户购买积分才能查看档案、访问对话记录并搜索服务器，而不必等待冷却时间。每个积分价值一美分，查看一个用户档案需要十个积分（缓存档案则需七个积分），这样一来，仅需十美分就能查找一个人。当然，Spy.pet只接受加密货币付款。
- en: There is also a special "enterprise" option that requires contact with the site
    owner. "Interested in training an AI model with Discord messages? Are you a group
    of federal agents looking for a new source of intel? Or maybe something else?
    We've got you covered," is how Spy.pet bills its top-tier program.

  zh: 还有一种特殊的“企业”选项需要与网站所有者联系。“有兴趣用Discord消息训练AI模型吗？你是一群寻找新情报来源的联邦特工吗？或者其他什么？我们都能帮到你。”这是Spy.pet对其顶级计划的宣传。
- en: It seems Spy.pet used to take donations via a Coinbase link, but this no longer
    works. This is apparently because Coinbase banned Spy.pet from operating on its
    platform, according to Spy.pet's [lone blog post](https://blog.spy.pet/p/february-update).

  zh: 看来Spy.pet曾通过Coinbase链接接受捐赠，但现在已不再使用。据Spy.pet的[唯一博客帖子](https://blog.spy.pet/p/february-update)称，这显然是因为Coinbase已禁止Spy.pet在其平台上运作。
- en: The same post also says the website was DDoS'ed throughout February, though
    the owner apparently shrugged it off. "All of these attacks caused minimal damage
    to myself personally or the website in general," the operator said. "All of this
    effort caused only 50 minutes of downtime. That's it."

  zh: 同一篇博文还说该网站在整个二月遭受了DDoS攻击，尽管所有者显然对此毫不在意。“所有这些攻击对我个人或整体网站造成的损害都很小。”运营者说道，“所有这些努力仅导致50分钟的停机时间。仅此而已。”
- en: As a side note, the footer of Spy.pet has some interesting content, such as
    a link to a video of TempleOS developer Terry Davis dancing, a "Transparency"
    page that just says the word "transparency," and a link to the "Request Removal"
    page that actually just plays the meme clip of newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson
    laughing at Peter Parker in the 2004 movie Spider-Man 2.

  zh: 顺便提一下，Spy.pet的页脚内容颇为有趣，如链接到TempleOS开发者Terry Davis跳舞视频的链接，一个“透明度”页面，只写有“透明度”一词，以及一个“请求移除”页面的链接，实际上只播放了2004年电影《蜘蛛侠2》中的报纸编辑J·乔纳·詹姆森嘲笑彼得·帕克的段子。
- en: 'Speaking of which, Spy.pet has a potentially interesting interpretation of
    the European Union''s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as pointed out
    by the [Stack Diary](https://stackdiary.com/spy-pet-is-harvesting-your-discord-history-with-no-ability-to-opt-out/)
    blog this week. Spy.pet may want to review at least three aspects of GDPR: Articles
    6, 8, and 17, which are the rules on consensual data tracking, parental consent
    for data tracking of minors, and the "right to be forgotten," or being able to
    ask for personal data to be deleted.'

  zh: 顺便说一句，本周[Stack Diary](https://stackdiary.com/spy-pet-is-harvesting-your-discord-history-with-no-ability-to-opt-out/)博客指出，Spy.pet对欧盟的《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）有一个潜在有趣的解释。Spy.pet可能希望至少审查GDPR的三个方面：第6条、第8条和第17条，即关于数据追踪的同意规则、未成年人数据追踪的父母同意以及“被遗忘权”，即请求删除个人数据的权利。
