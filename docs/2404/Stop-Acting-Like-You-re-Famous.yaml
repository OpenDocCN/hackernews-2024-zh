- en: You aren’t famous. Anything you do or create will probably receive little to
    no attention, so stop optimizing for a non-existent audience and instead focus
    on what makes you enjoy the activity.

- en: Want to try a craft or artistic hobby? Focus on mastering the skill and enjoy
    the variety it can provide. You don’t need to build a personal style. No one will
    care. Want to do photography and think black and white photos are cool? Great!
    You don’t need to create an Instagram branded all around your moody black and
    white photos. Most likely you’ll get bored of it and want to try a different type
    of photography, and that’s great. You aren’t Ansel Adams, no one will care if
    your “style” is all over the place.

    Then make it ugly. Who cares! Design is for an audience and you don’t have one.
    Functionality is more important right now. Maybe a designer will notice and want
    to improve it for you, but until then take pride in your crappy UI.

- en: Blogging is fun and therapeutic. Grammar and editing aren’t. As long as your
    thoughts are coherent, don’t worry too much about writing mistakes or filtering
    yourself. Just use Grammarly to fix elementary-level errors and move on. It’s
    more about the writing process than the final product.

- en: The most egregious thing you can do with any activity is daydream about how
    you can make money off of it. That’s the quickest way to optimize for the wrong
    things and suck the fun right out of it. Most likely you will stop doing the activity
    almost immediately, so save the money-making schemes for work.

    it. If you have to, make some goals for yourself, but never for your “audience”.
