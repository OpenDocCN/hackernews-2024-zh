    that Tesla’s “consideration score” — a metric used by Caliber to track consumer
    interest in brands, based on how they respond to the prompt “I would buy, or continue
    buying, products and services from Tesla, if given the chance” — has fallen to
    31 percent from its 70 percent high in November 2021, tumbling by 8 percent alone
    this January. Caliber’s consideration scores for rival EV-producing manufacturers
    Audi, BMW, and Mercedes, meanwhile, increased slightly during the same period,
    reaching between 44–47 percent.
