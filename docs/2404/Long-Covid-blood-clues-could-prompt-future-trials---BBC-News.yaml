    marker called SCG3, previously linked to impaired communication between the gut
    and the brain.

    useful for designing clinical trials, especially for treatments targeting immune
    responses and inflammation, the researchers said.

    suggested inflammation "could be a common feature of long Covid after hospitalisation,
    regardless of symptom type".
