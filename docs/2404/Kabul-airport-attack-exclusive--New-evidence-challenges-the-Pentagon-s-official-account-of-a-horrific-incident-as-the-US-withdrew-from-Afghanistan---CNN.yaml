- en: The Marine calmly described key details of blast and its aftermath, but became
    emotional when discussing the Pentagon’s investigations, including what he described
    as a lack of transparency about what happened, and the possible role Marine gunfire
    played in raising the Afghan civilian death toll.

- en: But he defended the immediate response of his colleagues under attack. “The
    reaction that the Marines had was a reaction that I believe anybody trained to
    do in that scenario would have had,” he said, suggesting they were in the first
    phase of the three-stage practice of RTR – Returning fire, Taking cover and then
    Returning accurate fire.

- en: “You’ve got to think, these are kids,” he said. “They’re young. And they’ve
    only been taught what they’ve been taught. Some of these kids had been with the
    unit for quite literally two, three months prior to deployment. They didn’t have
    the training to be able to recognize some of the things that, you know, might
    have occurred – nor could you have the training for what had happened on August
    26\. Or really what happened in Kabul.”

- en: He said the significant gunfire response from Marines after the blast was common
    knowledge among Marine survivors, even though it was not spoken of publicly. “It’s
    incredibly weird,” he said. “It’s frustrating, you know? Why hide from what happened?”

- en: 'Reacting to the Pentagon’s dismissal of accounts from US personnel who recalled
    gunfire as the product of TBI, the Marine said: “It’s a pathetic excuse. To say
    that every Marine, every soldier, every Navy corpsman on the deck has a traumatic
    brain injury and cannot remember gunfire is, is lunacy. It’s outright disrespectful.
    And especially for it to come from somebody that wasn’t there.”'

    he heard suppressed rifle fire nearby from another Marine. Many US Marines’ rifles
    were fitted with suppressors, reducing the noise of their fire, according to footage

    was definitely, shooting,” he said. “Snapping over our heads after the blast and
    it wasn’t the Taliban.” He said he used his rifle optic to look at the Taliban,
    who were some distance away on nearby shipping containers used to control access
    to the Abbey Gate area. “When I looked over at them, none of them were holding
    their guns. They looked just as shocked as us.”
