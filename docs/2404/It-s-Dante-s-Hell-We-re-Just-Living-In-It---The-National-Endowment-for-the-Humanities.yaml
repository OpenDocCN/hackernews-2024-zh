    paragraph. First published in 1294, *La Vita Nuova i*s a tantalizing prelude to
    the Florentine poet’s masterpiece, *La Commedia*, known today as *The Divine Comedy*.
    For centuries, readers and scholars have pored over *La Vita Nuova* (Italian for,
    literally, the new life)—convinced, as we often are, that a gifted writer’s nascent
    work contains the answers to longstanding mysteries.

    “two gracious ladies” of “noble lineage.” The poem begins: “Beyond the widest
    of the circling spheres / A sigh which leaves my heart aspires to move.” The sigh
    was a heavy one; a protracted sigh, in fact, that Dante had exhaled for much of
    his life. “As it nears / Its goal of longing in the realms above / The pilgrim
    spirit sees a vision”—a vision of Beatrice, the woman he loved for much of his
    life. “This much,” the sonnet concludes, “I know well.”'

    will write toward her glory, “as she indeed knows,” and he prays that God will
    grant him enough years so that he can “compose concerning her what has never been
    written in rhyme of any woman.”

    join his beloved in eternity while affirming that she is in sight of the divine.

    it is an undiscovered letter that is most enticing. Near the end of *La Vita Nuova*,
    after the death of his beloved Beatrice, Dante wrote a letter to the city of Florence:
    “After she had departed this life, the city of which I have spoken was left as
    though widowed, despoiled of all good, and I, still mourning in this city of desolation,
    wrote to the rulers of the earth, telling them something of its condition.” He
    quotes the opening of Lamentations 1:1, from the prophet Jeremiah, as the start
    of his own letter: *Quomodo sedet sola civitas* (“How doth the city sit solitary”),
    likening Beatrice to God, who had deserted a sinful Jerusalem.'

    own words are repeated. He responds to the reader’s expected criticism: “My excuse
    is that I intended from the beginning to write only in the vernacular [in this
    book], and since the words which follow those I have quoted are all in Latin it
    would be contrary to my intention if I quoted them all.” The full letter has been
    lost to history. Yet paired with the final Latin lines of *La Vita Nuova*, the
    hidden letter captures a paradox of language. For a poet seeking to forge a fresh
    vision through a new vernacular, he remains transfixed by an ancient tongue and
    tradition.'

    of ego—however necessary ambition is to poetry. Rather, Dante’s commentary within
    *La Vita Nuova* is an affirmation of the process of poetry. Although prose is
    also the result of technique and revision, poetry is “the best words in the best
    order,” to borrow Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s pithy definition. Lineated poetry—poems
    with deliberate line breaks, chosen by rhythm or rhyme—requires distillation and
    compression of ideas. By laying bare the turns of his verse, Dante offers readers
    a view into the interplay between imagination and language; between idea and poetic
    material. His exegetical mode, a literary practice often applied to Scripture,
    also marks poetry as a sacred activity.

    that followed, and the many times that he thought of her, Beatrice would stir
    a physical reaction in Dante; a “tremble” that was obvious to onlookers. Friends
    observed that he “grew so frail and weak” because his “soul was wholly given to
    thoughts” of Beatrice. He often wept. Dante again returned to the stirrings of

    sharpness “in the tenth-century Arabic poetry of the Omayyad Moorish kingdoms
    of southern Spain.” There circulated the story of the poet Yusuf Ibn Harun al-Ramadi,
    who became smitten with a woman named Khalwa in Córdoba who “entirely captured
    my heart, so that all my limbs were penetrated by the love of her.” After a short
    conversation, she leaves him, but he is unable to forget her: “I know not whether
    the heavens have devoured her, or whether the earth has swallowed her up; and
    the feeling I have in my heart on her account is hotter than burning coals.”'
