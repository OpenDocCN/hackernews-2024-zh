    paragraph. First published in 1294, *La Vita Nuova i*s a tantalizing prelude to
    the Florentine poet’s masterpiece, *La Commedia*, known today as *The Divine Comedy*.
    For centuries, readers and scholars have pored over *La Vita Nuova* (Italian for,

    was a heavy one; a protracted sigh, in fact, that Dante had exhaled for much of
    his life. “As it nears / Its goal of longing in the realms above / The pilgrim
    spirit sees a vision”—a vision of Beatrice, the woman he loved for much of his

    lady, that is of the blessed Beatrice, who now in glory beholds the face of Him.”

    wrote to the rulers of the earth, telling them something of its condition.” He

    sedet sola civitas*），将贝阿特丽切比作神，就像神离弃了一个罪恶的耶路撒冷。

    is that I intended from the beginning to write only in the vernacular [in this

    would be contrary to my intention if I quoted them all.” The full letter has been
    lost to history. Yet paired with the final Latin lines of *La Vita Nuova*, the

    of ego—however necessary ambition is to poetry. Rather, Dante’s commentary within

    also the result of technique and revision, poetry is “the best words in the best
    order,” to borrow Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s pithy definition. Lineated poetry—poems
    with deliberate line breaks, chosen by rhythm or rhyme—requires distillation and
    compression of ideas. By laying bare the turns of his verse, Dante offers readers
    a view into the interplay between imagination and language; between idea and poetic

    crimson.” Dante was not merely smitten; he was transformed. During their few interactions

    a physical reaction in Dante; a “tremble” that was obvious to onlookers. Friends
    observed that he “grew so frail and weak” because his “soul was wholly given to
    thoughts” of Beatrice. He often wept. Dante again returned to the stirrings of

    / 并且产生了一种甜蜜的渴望 / 来召唤这样的仁慈归于他。”

  zh: 在他的《炼狱》翻译序言中，默温赞美了其独特的性质：“在诗的三个部分中，只有炼狱发生在地球上，就像我们的生活一样，我们的脚踏实地，穿越海滩，攀登山峰。”
    在《地狱》的第一首歌中描绘的陆地世界是一个原始的地狱，充满了荒野的超现实意象。默温对《炼狱》的这种说法确实引人入胜。
- en: 'As a poet, Merwin was drawn to how the present is stitched to eternity. “All
    day the stars watch from long ago,” he begins his poem “Rain Light”: “my mother
    said I am going now / when you are alone you will be all right / whether or not
    you know you will know.” The eternal nature of the cosmos, juxtaposed with that
    still-eternal human emotion—love—creates a transcendent feel in his poem. The
    narrator affirms that “all the flowers are forms of water” as “the sun reminds
    them through a white cloud,” for “the washed colors of the afterlife” have “lived
    there long before you were born.”'

  zh: 作为一位诗人，默温被现在如何与永恒联系在一起所吸引。“整天星星从很久以前注视着”，他在诗篇“雨之光”中开始道：“我母亲说我现在要走了/ 当你独自一人时，你会没事的/
    无论你知不知道你将知道。” 宇宙的永恒本质与仍然永恒的人类情感——爱——在他的诗中营造了一种超越的感觉。叙述者肯定道：“所有的花朵都是水的形态”，因为“太阳透过白云提醒它们”，因为“来世的洗涤颜色”“早在你出生之前就已经存在了”。
- en: Merwin eschews punctuation in “Rain Light,” his series of run-on lines creating
    a gentle profluence, and complicating the source of the statements. The narrator’s
    mother speaks in the second line of the poem, and the tenor of that assigned statement
    carries through the lines that follow, offering the possibility that her love
    is the source of the wisdom—a love that transcends death.

  zh: 默温在《雨之光》中避免使用标点符号，他一系列的接续线创造了一种温和的前进，并复杂化了声明的来源。叙述者的母亲在诗的第二行说话，被赋予的声明的基调贯穿随后的行，提供她的爱可能是智慧的源泉——一种超越死亡的爱。
- en: 'Our greatest freedom resides in our gesture toward eternity, and Virgil affirms
    Dante’s desire for freedom in the first canto of *Purgatorio*: “Now may it please
    you to approve his coming; / his goal is liberty, and one who has / forfeited
    life for that knows how dear it is.” Whenever Dante struggles, Virgil reminds
    him of Beatrice, who will set him free: “I do not know whether you grasp my meaning.
    / I am speaking of Beatrice, whom you will see / at the top of this mountain,
    happy and smiling.” Dante’s reaction is immediate: “My lord, let us walk faster,
    for / I do not feel tired as I did before, / and see how the hill now casts its
    shadow.”'

  zh: 我们最大的自由存在于我们对永恒的姿态中，维吉尔在《炼狱》的第一首歌中肯定了但丁对自由的渴望：“现在请你批准他的到来；/ 他的目标是自由，一个为此/ 牺牲生命的人知道它是多么宝贵。”
    每当但丁挣扎时，维吉尔提醒他贝娅特丽切，她将使他自由：“我不知道你是否理解我的意思。/ 我在说的是贝娅特丽切，你将在/ 这座山的顶端看到她，快乐而微笑。”
    但丁的反应是即时的：“我的主人，让我们走得更快，因为/ 我不再感到像以前那样累了，/ 看，山现在如何投下它的影子。”
- en: 'In Canto 27, Virgil’s final words to Dante affirm the evolution of the poet
    from a melancholy, dizzy mortal to one infused with a measure of blessed wisdom:
    “Expect no further word or sign from me. / Your own will is whole, upright, and
    free, / and it would be wrong not to do as it bids you, // therefore I crown and
    miter you over yourself.” Yet Dante, perhaps world weary from his own exile, tempers
    the potential joy of *Purgatorio*’s conclusion. In language that recalls *La Vita
    Nuova*, Dante notes that he has not “been left helplessly undone / with awe and
    trembling in her presence.” He is stirred, however, by an old feeling: “the high
    force beat upon my / sight, as it had pierced me before I / had yet emerged out
    of my childhood.”'

  zh: 在《地狱篇》第27首中，维吉尔对但丁的最后一句话肯定了诗人从忧郁、头晕的凡人到充满祝福智慧的进化：“不要再期待我更多的话语或迹象。/ 你自己的意志是完整的、正直的和自由的，/
    不按它吩咐去做是错误的，// 因此我戴上冠冕，将你加冕在你自己之上。” 然而但丁，也许因为自己的流亡而世界倦怠，减轻了《炼狱》结局的潜在喜悦。但丁用回忆《新生活》的语言指出，他并没有“无助地留下，/
    在她面前充满敬畏和颤抖。” 但他被一个旧感觉所激动：“高贵的力量冲击了我的/ 视线，就像在我还没有/ 走出童年之前那样。”
- en: Dante is much like a child at this moment, so overjoyed that he wishes to share
    his feelings with his poet-father, Virgil, but his guide is gone. Dante weeps.
    Beatrice appears, but does not console him. Rather, she rebukes him to the assembled
    angels, lamenting that although “For a while I sustained him with my face,” later
    Dante “took himself from me and gave himself to others.” Finally, when she “had
    risen from flesh to spirit” and departed this earth, “I was less dear and pleasing
    to him.”

  zh: 此刻的但丁很像一个孩子，如此喜悦以至于他希望与他的诗人父亲**维吉尔**分享自己的感受，但他的向导已经离去。但丁哭泣。**贝阿特丽切**出现了，但并没有安慰他。相反，她谴责他面对众天使，悲叹道，尽管“有一段时间，我以我的面容支撑他”，但后来但丁“离开了我，投向了其他人。”最后，当她“从肉体上升到精神”，离开了这个世界，“我对他来说就不再那么亲爱和讨喜了。”
- en: In real life, Dante married a fellow Florentine named Gemma di Manetto Donati—an
    arranged union that bore several children, yet was unmentioned in his works. They
    likely married before Beatrice’s death in 1290, yet Beatrice’s rejoinder of Dante
    in *Purgatorio* is certainly more a product of his poetic guilt than any reality.

  zh: 在现实生活中，但丁与一位名叫**杰玛·迪·马内托·多纳蒂**的佛罗伦萨女子结了婚——这是一场安排好的婚姻，他们生了几个孩子，但在他的作品中却没有提及。他们可能在1290年**贝阿特丽切**去世之前就结了婚，但在《炼狱篇》中，**但丁**对贝阿特丽切的回应显然更多是他诗意上的愧疚，而非现实。
- en: 'Rather than negating Dante’s desire for freedom, the work’s paradoxical climax
    affirms a timeless, complex component of liberty: The material and spiritual elements
    of liberty are often in tension with each other. In May 1315, officials in Florence
    offered Dante a return home to his beloved city—but appended rather humiliating
    stipulations. Dante refused, and both he and his family were again condemned by
    the city.'

  zh: 与其是否定但丁对自由的渴望，这部作品悖论性的高潮肯定了自由的一个永恒而复杂的组成部分：物质和精神自由元素之间常常存在紧张关系。1315年5月，佛罗伦萨官员提出让但丁回到他心爱的城市，但附加了相当羞辱性的条件。但丁拒绝了，并且他和他的家人再次被城市谴责。
- en: 'In one of his surviving letters, Dante writes to “a Florentine friend.” Although
    he appreciates the invitation, and the support of his friend (“it happens very
    rarely to exiles to find friends”), he rejects such an ignoble return. He then
    shares his reasoning: “Can I not look upon the face of the sun and the stars everywhere?
    Can I not meditate anywhere under the heavens upon most sweet truths, unless I
    first render myself inglorious, nay ignominious, to the people and state of Florence?”'
