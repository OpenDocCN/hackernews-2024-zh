- en: In a world without partisan politics, the Cass report on youth gender medicine
    would prompt serious reflection from American trans-rights activists, their supporters
    in the media, and the doctors and institutions offering hormonal and surgical
    treatments to minors. At the request of the English National Health Service, the
    senior pediatrician Hilary Cass has completed the most thorough consideration
    yet of this field, and her report calmly and carefully demolishes many common
    activist tropes. Puberty blockers *do* have side effects, Cass found. The evidence
    base for widely used treatments is “[shaky](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/gender-medicine-built-on-shaky-foundations-cass-review-finds).”
    Their safety and effectiveness are not settled science.

    as well as on a series of new, systematic literature reviews. Its publication
    marks a decisive turn away from the affirmative model of treatment, [in line](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/gender-affirming-care-debate-europe-dutch-protocol/673890/)
    with similar moves in other European countries. What Cass’s [final document](https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)
    finds, largely, is an *absence*. “The reality is that we have no good evidence
    on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress,”
    Cass writes. We also don’t have strong evidence that social transitioning, such
    as changing names or pronouns, affects adolescents’ mental-health outcomes (either
    positively or negatively). We don’t have strong evidence that puberty blockers
    are merely a pause button, or that their benefits outweigh their downsides, or
    that they are lifesaving care in the sense that they prevent suicides. We don’t
    know why the number of children turning up at gender clinics rose so dramatically
    during the 2010s, or why the demographics of those children changed from a majority
    of biological males to a majority of biological females. Neither “born that way”
    nor “it’s all social contagion” captures the complexity of the picture, Cass writes.

    gender-related distress, “for the majority of young people, a medical pathway
    may not be the best way to achieve this.” That conclusion will now inform the
    creation of new state-provided services in England. These will attempt to consider
    patients more holistically, acknowledging that their gender distress might be
    part of a picture that also includes anxiety, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    eating disorders, or past trauma.'

    to simply *affirm* an adolescent’s stated gender—and from common practice at American
    gender clinics. For example, a [Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-transyouth-care/)
    found that, of 18 U.S. clinics surveyed, none conducted the lengthy psychological
    assessments used by Dutch researchers who pioneered the use of medical gender
    treatments in adolescents; some clinics prescribe puberty blockers or hormones
    during a patient’s first visit. Under pressure from its members, the American
    Academy of Pediatrics last year commissioned its own evidence review, which is
    still in progress. But at the same time, the group [restated](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/health/aap-gender-affirming-care-evidence-review.html)
    its 2018 commitment to the medical model.

    outlets, some of which have uncritically repeated advocacy groups’ talking points.
    In an extreme example recently noted by the writer Jesse Singal, CNN seems to
    [have a verbal formula](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/why-is-the-same-misleading-language),
    repeated across multiple stories, to assure its audience that “gender-affirming
    care is medically necessary, evidence-based care.” On a variety of platforms,
    prominent liberal commentators have presented growing concerns about the use of
    puberty blockers as an ill-informed moral panic.

- en: The truth is that, although American medical groups have indeed reached a consensus
    about the benefits of youth gender medicine, doctors with direct experience in
    the field are divided, particularly outside the United States. “Clinicians who
    have spent many years working in gender clinics have drawn very different conclusions
    from their clinical experience about the best way to support young people with
    gender-related distress,” Cass writes. Her report is a challenge to the latest
    standards of care from the U.S.-based World Professional Association for Transgender
    Health, which [declined](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/378/bmj.o2303.full.pdf)
    to institute minimum-age limits for surgery. The literature review included with
    her report is notably brutal about these guidelines, which are highly influential
    in youth gender medicine in America and around the world—but which, according
    to Cass, “lack developmental rigour.”

- en: The crux of the report is that the ambitions of youth gender medicine outstripped
    the evidence—or, as Cass puts it, that doctors at the U.K. clinic whose practices
    she was examining, although well-meaning, “developed a fundamentally different
    philosophy and approach compared to other paediatric and mental health services.”
    How, she asks, did the medical pathway of puberty blockers and then cross-sex
    hormones—a treatment based on a [single Dutch study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0092623X.2022.2121238)
    in the 1990s—spread around the world so quickly and decisively? Why didn’t clinicians
    seek out more studies to confirm or disprove its safety and utility earlier? And
    what should child gender services look like now?

- en: The answer to those first two questions is the same. Medicalized gender treatments
    for minors became wrapped up with a push for wider social acceptance for transgender
    people, something that was presented as the “[next frontier](https://time.com/magazine/us/135460/june-9th-2014-vol-183-no-22-u-s/)
    in civil rights,” as *Time* magazine once described it. Any questions about such
    care were therefore read as stemming from transphobic hostility, full stop. And
    when those questions kept coming anyway, right-wing politicians and anti-woke
    comedians piled on, sensing an area where left-wing intellectuals were out of
    touch with popular opinion. In turn, that allowed misgivings to be dismissed as
    “[fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2024/03/judith-butler-whos-afraid-of-gender/677874/),”
    even though, as the British journalist Sarah Ditum has written, “it is not damning
    of feminists that they are on the same page as Vladimir Putin about there being
    two sexes. That is just how many sexes there are.”

    from charities and lobbying groups to push children toward a medical pathway.
    As Cass notes, “There are few other areas of healthcare where professionals are
    so afraid to openly discuss their views, where people are vilified on social media,
    and where name-calling echoes the worst bullying behaviour.”

    outcomes. The report’s research team at the University of York tried to follow
    up on 9,000 former GIDS patients but was informed by National Health Service authorities
    in England in January that “despite efforts to encourage the participation of
    the NHS gender clinics, the necessary cooperation had not been forthcoming.” Cass
    has since [wondered aloud](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/children-are-being-used-as-a-football-hilary-cass-on-her-review-of-gender-identity-services)
    if this decision was “ideologically driven,” and she recommends that the clinics
    be “directed to comply” with her team’s request for data.

    gender appears to be receding in Britain. Kamran Abbasi, the editor in chief of
    *The BMJ*, the country’s foremost medical journal, [wrote](https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj.q837)
    an editorial praising the report and echoing its conclusion that many “studies
    in gender medicine fall woefully short in terms of methodological rigour.” The
    country’s left-wing Labour Party has [already accepted](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/uk-trans-rights-labour-party/674944/)
    that feminist concerns about gender self-identification are legitimate, and its
    health spokesperson, Wes Streeting, [welcomed](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/10/thousands-of-children-unsure-of-gender-identity-let-down-by-nhs-report-finds)
    the Cass report as soon as it was published. (The ruling Conservatives have also
    enthusiastically [embraced](https://news.sky.com/story/cass-report-remarkably-weak-evidence-and-toxic-debate-around-gender-letting-children-down-review-warns-13111445)
    its conclusions, and the former health secretary Sajid Javid pushed through a
    [law change](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68786030) that made its data collection
    possible.)  The LGBTQ charity Stonewall [responded](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-statement-cass-review)
    to the report by saying that some of its recommendations could be “positive,”
    and urged politicians to read it. Even Mermaids, the charity most associated with
    pushing the affirmative model in Britain, offered only [lukewarm criticism](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/news/the-cass-review-mermaids-response/)
    that more gatekeeping could further increase waiting times.
