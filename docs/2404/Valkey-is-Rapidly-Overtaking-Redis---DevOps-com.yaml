- en: In March, [Redis announced](https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/)
    that it was dumping the open source [BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)
    for its [Redis in-memory key-value database](https://devops.com/redis-labs-extends-reach-of-in-memory-database/),
    instead adopting a “source-available” [Redis Source Available License](https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/)
    (RSALv2) and [Server Side Public License](https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/)
    (SSPLv1). That made both [developers and users unhappy](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/22/redis_changes_license/).
    So as open source people do, members of the community [forked the code into](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/12/linux_foundation_opinion/)
    [Valkey](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/12/linux_foundation_opinion/) with
    the support of The Linux Foundation. This move has proved much more popular than
    expected.

    announced at the [Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/)
    in Seattle the availability of the [first release,](https://valkey.io/blog/update/2024/04/valkey-7-2-5-out/)
    [Valkey](https://valkey.io/blog/update/2024/04/valkey-7-2-5-out/) [7.2.5 GA](https://valkey.io/blog/update/2024/04/valkey-7-2-5-out/).
    This release is based on the last open source version of Redis, 7.2.4\. That’s
    good news, but it’s not big news. That’s what we expect from forks.

    the fork. Now Alibaba Cloud, Aiven, Heroku and Percona are backing Valkey as well.
    I’ve seen many forks take off and overcome their parent projects – LibreOffice
    over OpenOffice comes to mind — but I’ve never seen one where so many Fortune
    500 businesses spun on their heels to drop one project for another.

    or even increase their contributions. Their support is needed for the long-term
    health and viability of the project. The community is thankful for their support,
    which will help keep the project open and keep our developers moving at the pace
    that our users demand.”

    business needs. As Olson pointed out, its technical leadership committee has 26
    years  of experience and over 1,000 commits to the open source project. Indeed,
    Tencent’s [Binbin Zhu](https://lwn.net/Articles/966631/), a committee member,
    alone contributed almost a quarter of the open source Redis commits.

    major cloud service providers have all benefited commercially from the Redis open
    source project, so it’s not surprising that they are launching a fork within a
    foundation,” he wrote. And he added, “Innovation has been and always will be the
    differentiating factor between the success of Redis and any alternative solution.”

    off. As Heroku’s CTO Gail Frederick said during the conference, “With this group
    of experienced contributors and broad industry backing, Valkey is continuing the
    open source model that’s been transformative for developers everywhere.”

    (the company) with serious challenges. After all, [Redis was the most popular
    database on AWS](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/23/redis_the_most_popular_db_on_aws/)
    and by DB-Engine’s latest count, [it’s the most popular key-value DBMS](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking).

    [Valkey](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/why-aws-supports-valkey/) for
    the long term. We are adding Valkey support to our ElastiCache and MemoryDB managed
    database services, which are built on open source Redis.”

    “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Cache will continue supporting its current
    Redis 7.0-based service because the license changes don’t impact it.” However,
    Oracle is dropping the name Redis from its offering and is “[working on integrating](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oracle-supports-valkey)
    [Valkey](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oracle-supports-valkey)
    [support into the OCI Cache service](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oracle-supports-valkey)
    to ensure our unique in-memory database offerings on OCI continue to benefit from
    open source advancements, enhancing value for our customers.”

    cloud economist at The Duckbill Group, an AWS analyst firm, tweeted, “Good morning
    to everyone except [the thieves at Redis](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1778484953661194524).
    You didn’t build it; you stole it from the community. If you want it from the
    ones who built it, it’s called Valkey.”
