    atmospheric and ocean pattern, La Niña.

- en: For the U.S., this climatological flip-flop will likely mean a greater risk
    of major hurricanes in the Atlantic as well as areas of drier-than-usual weather
    in the southern portions of the country. Globally, La Niña usually leads to declining
    temperatures, but the lag in when the effects take place means that 2024 will
    likely still be a top-five year for temperature in climate history, said [Tom
    Di Liberto](https://www.tomdiliberto.com/), a climate scientist at the National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

    opposing patterns in the trade winds that encircle the equator, blowing west from
    South America toward Asia. In a neutral year, when neither pattern is in play,
    these trade winds push warm water westward, which drives cool ocean water up from
    the depths to replace it.'

- en: When [El Niño](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/what-is-el-nino)
    is in play, the trade winds weaken, so the eastern Pacific, along the west coast
    of North and South America, stays warmer. The effect, according to NOAA, is that
    the jet stream moves southward, drying Canada and the northern U.S. but bringing
    moisture to the southern portions of the U.S.

    and increasing the upwelling of cold water off the Pacific coast of the Americas.
    The jet stream moves northward, drying the Southwest and Southeast and bringing
    wetter weather to the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes.

    but NOAA's Climate Prediction Center now reports that the pattern is weakening,
    with an 85% chance of a switch to neutral conditions before June. La Niña is then
    expected to roar back, with a 60% chance of La Niña conditions between June and
    August, the [National Centers for Environmental Prediction](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml)
    reports.

- en: The flip from El Niño to La Niña raises the risk of a strong upcoming hurricane
    season, said [Alex DesRosiers](https://tropical.colostate.edu/member_research/desrosiers.html),
    a doctoral candidate in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. During
    El Niño, rising heat from the eastern Pacific flows into the upper atmosphere,
    leading to stronger winds at high altitudes. This creates vertical wind shear
    — a difference in wind speed and direction at the surface versus higher in the
    atmosphere. And vertical wind shear, DesRosiers told Live Science, "can really
    act to tear apart hurricanes as they try to form."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During La Niña, the upper atmosphere winds calm, reducing wind shear. This allows
    the convection of warm, moist air from the ocean surface to form big storms.

    storms to bubble up and intensify," DesRosiers said.'

    surface temperatures, CSU's Tropical Weather & Climate Research team is currently
    [predicting a very active Atlantic hurricane season](https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html),
    with a forecast of 23 named storms (versus the average of 14.4) and five hurricanes
    of Category 3 or higher (versus the average of 3.2). This year may look similar
    to 2010 and 2020, both of which were busy storm seasons, although it's not guaranteed
    that strong storms will impact land, DesRosiers said.

- en: All of these climatic patterns are taking place against a backdrop of rising
    ocean and surface temperatures. So, while La Niña usually brings cooler-than-average
    temperatures to the northern U.S., this region could still experience a scorching
    summer due to the background effects of [climate change](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change),
    Di Liberto said.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, although 2023 was an El Niño year, which should suppress hurricanes,
    it saw an above-average hurricane season, DesRosiers said. This busy storm season
    might be due, in part, to 2023 being the warmest year on record.
