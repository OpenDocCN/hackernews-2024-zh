  zh: 根据3M自己的说法，公司的故事显示了类似的文化危机。在2002年由公司出版的书籍[*A Century of Innovation*](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/171240O/3m-century-of-innovation-book.pdf)中，这本书是公司庆祝其100周年时出版的，公司将剥离创新比作其八年前决定出售复制产品部门的决心。
- en: '*Of all the businesses 3M has shed over its 100 years, the two seminal decisions
    that people point to as most significant involved the sale of 3M’s Duplicating
    Products business to Harris Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia, and the spin-off
    of 3M’s data-storage and imaging-systems businesses in 1996 creating a new company
    called Imation in Oakdale, Minnesota, near 3M headquarters. The two decisions
    have several elements in common—both involved businesses that 3M created and,
    in fact, ranked number one in the marketplace for decades. They were “homegrown”
    businesses—largely created within 3M and commercialized and built with the energy
    of many internal sponsors and champions. The businesses were risky because the
    products were based on pioneering technologies. They not only changed the basis
    of competition; they also created all new, global industries. The businesses were
    highly profitable for decades, and they represented a significant share of the
    company’s total annual revenues. They also produced many of 3M’s next generation
    of leaders.*'

  zh: '*3M在其100年历史中剥离的所有业务中，人们认为最重要的两个开创性决定涉及将3M的复制产品业务出售给亚特兰大乔治亚州的哈里斯公司，并于1996年将3M的数据存储和成像系统业务剥离，创建了一家名为Imation的新公司，该公司位于明尼苏达州奥克代尔市，靠近3M总部。这两个决定有几个共同点——都涉及3M创造并在市场上数十年排名第一的业务。它们都是“本土”业务——主要在3M内部创造，并通过许多内部赞助人和倡导者的努力进行商业化和建设。这些业务很有风险，因为产品基于开拓性技术。它们不仅改变了竞争基础，还创造了全新的全球产业。这些业务数十年来非常有利可图，并且占据了公司总年收入的重要份额。它们还培养了3M的许多下一代领导人。*'
- en: So what happened? Essentially, despite the company’s success working in industrial
    and professional settings, doing things for consumers like producing videotapes,
    floppy disks, and cassettes meant moving out of its comfort zone. These products,
    initially developed for businesses, grew so popular that they suddenly needed
    to be available at every big-box store and drugstore alike, and, Post-its aside,
    retail was not a fit for the kind of company 3M was.

  zh: 那么发生了什么？本质上，尽管公司在工业和专业环境中取得了成功，但像生产录像带、软盘和磁带这样的消费品意味着离开其舒适区。这些产品最初是为企业开发的，但它们如此受欢迎，以至于突然间需要在每个大型连锁店和药店中都有销售，而除了便笺之外，零售并不适合3M这样的公司。

  zh: 但更重要的是，其他公司更擅长压低成本，如公司传记所述，这需要做出一些艰难的决定：
- en: '*While it sold its products for little or no profit, its competition sold their
    products for even less. Even though the consumer business had huge growth potential,
    3M had little experience with a low-cost, low-profit-margin model.*'

- en: '*The markings were clear—exit this business, even though 3M invented it. To
    stay in the “dog fight” meant 3M had to invest enormous amounts of money in order
    to remain the low-cost producer, with no assurance that profit margins ever would
    improve. “Exiting it was the right decision,” [former senior vice president Al]
    Huber said.*'

    Huber说道。*'
- en: Seeing what came after, it’s hard to disagree. While floppies were still a significant
    medium in the mid-1990s, it was obvious that they would not be enough capacity
    for the next generation of data hoarders. It would only be a couple of years before
    Apple would put the first dagger in the heart of the floppy disk with [the iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3),
    breaking with tradition by releasing a personal computer in 1998 with no built-in
    floppy disk drive.

  zh: 看到接下来发生的事情，很难不同意这一观点。虽然在1990年代中期，软盘仍然是一个重要的存储介质，但显然它们的容量已经无法满足下一代数据收集者的需求。仅仅几年后，苹果公司便在1998年推出了没有内置软盘驱动器的个人电脑[iMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3)，这打破了传统。

    drives, compact cassettes, and videotapes—the three key elements of 3M’s move
    into consumer-driven magnetic media—had fallen by the wayside. Imation, still
    active today, is owned by O-Jin Corp., a Korean technology company [that basically
    bought it for its trademarked name](http://www.imation.com/board/bbs/board.php?bo_table=news_en&wr_id=11).

  zh: 这是未来的前兆。在做出这个决定的十年内，软盘驱动器、磁带和录像带——3M进入消费驱动磁介质的三个关键元素——已经逐渐退出了市场。至今仍在运营的Imation，现由韩国科技公司O-Jin
    Corp.所有，后者基本上是为了其商标而收购了Imation。

- en: My first experience with 3M was seeing its bright red logo on floppy disks used
    in classrooms with Apple IIe computers in the late 1980s and early ’90s. 3M was
    instantly recognizable among those responsible for creating the disks we needed
    to load up *Number Munchers* and *Commander Keen*, and as a result, its name is
    forever imprinted into the brains of retro-tech nerds the world over. It is a
    memory that gives me warm feelings.

    Munchers*和*Commander Keen*的软盘的人来说，3M是一眼可辨认的。因此，它的名字永远地印在了全世界复古技术发烧友的脑海中。这是一个让我感到温暖的记忆。
- en: But 3M, for a number of reasons, is not a company that carries a lot of goodwill
    with younger generations. For example, the company is closely associated with
    the manufacturing of a variety of chemicals, including PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonate),
    a key ingredient in Scotchguard and other water-resistant materials. It’s one
    of many PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl) substances that are believed
    to be harmful to humans.

- en: The floppy disks that I and other elder millennials associate with a company
    that was essential to our youthful computing experience are long gone, shuttled
