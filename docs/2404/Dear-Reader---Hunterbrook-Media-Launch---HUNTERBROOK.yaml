    borrowers have paid UWM between an estimated hundreds of millions and billions
    more in closing costs than people whose brokers found them typical loans in the
    last four years — controlling for interest rates, transaction type, and other
    variables.

    that UWM has potentially committed fraud, would likely lose business and gain-on-sale
    margin if brokers fulfilled their fiduciary duties, and could face material legal
    and regulatory consequences — from civil, state, and federal accountability. UWM’s
    contracts with its credit lenders; contracts with its mortgage purchasers like
    Fannie and Freddie; and the CEO’s ownership of an NBA team may also potentially
    be at risk, Hunterbrook Media believes.'

    four days, including sending basic questions about UWM’s publicly-available information.
    UWM declined to comment directly and instead responded with a cease-and-desist
    letter, sent by an outside law firm. UWM’s lawyers claimed that four days was
    not a “reasonable” opportunity to comment. Hunterbrook counsel responded that
    “it was evidently more than enough time for UWM to direct you and your firm to
    send Hunterbrook Media a six-page letter threatening a strategic lawsuit against
    protected First Amendment activity.”
