    from drifting. The hundreds discovered on the seabed are testimony to the intense
    maritime traffic along the coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean in the second millennium
    BCE. While there are certainly more anchors in the sea than on land, this second
    group is no less interesting. In particular, those anchors found in sacred contexts
    present distinctive features that make them the ideal subject within a CBT framework.
    In fact, such votive stone anchors are some of the most significant artefacts
    that both materially and metaphorically express the connection between the maritime
    community and the sea. The term *votive* is intended here in opposition to secular
    or mundane, to indicate objects that were deposited in special places within a
    framework of religious beliefs, possibly but not necessarily in fulfilment of
    a vow. Therefore, the focus of this study are the votive stone anchors that were
    discovered in temples and sanctuaries. The non-votive anchors and the ones found
    on the seabed will not be included in this paper as they would deserve a separate
    discussion.^([Footnote 1](#Fn1)) Instead, they will only be addressed when necessary
    to clarify elements about the votive stone anchors. Strong similarities can be
    detected between anchors embedded in the architecture of sanctuaries and those
    in tombs. However, the evidence for the use of stone anchors in tombs is limited
    to about ten anchors, five of which derive from problematic contexts or are now
    lost (Brody, [1998](/article/10.1007/s10816-024-09642-z#ref-CR3 "Brody, A. J.
    (1998). “Each man cried out to his God”: The specialized religion of Canaanite
    and Phoenician seafarers. Scholars Press."), pp. 89–92), which makes the votive
    nature of these objects very difficult to confirm. For these reasons, I prefer
    to exclude them from the present discussion. Even in sanctuaries, especially in
    those with centuries of continuous use (*e.g.* at Kition-*Kathari*), we encounter
    cases where the votive function of an anchor is difficult to prove, and indeed,
    it may well be that some were used as common building material. Nevertheless,
    there is abundant evidence that a majority of those found in temples have clear
    symbolic implications.'

- en: Concerning the characteristics of said votive stone anchors, like their secular
    counterparts, they are roughly triangular or trapezoidal stones, often rather
    large, equipped with one or more passing holes, which, theoretically, could be
    used for the rope and the wooden stocks. Quite intuitively, the first defining
    element distinguishing a votive anchor from a secular one is its context of primary
    deposition. Votive anchors are found in a variety of locations within sacred precincts
    and temples, where they can be incorporated in the foundation walls, as well as
    placed free standing in courtyards and other open spaces. Indeed, the placing
    of anchors in building deposits well resonates with the long tradition of placing
    foundation/building deposits in sanctuaries as a mean to assure divine protection.^([Footnote

    as far as it could be observed, all the votive anchors in the temples were deposited
    new. It was initially supposed that some of these anchors, particularly those
    used in the stone foundations of the walls and as the base for pillars and columns,
    could have been deposited after the successful journey of a ship. However, as
    Frost pointed out, this does not appear to have been the case as none of the anchors
    discussed here shows signs of ever being used at sea (Frost, [1985](/article/10.1007/s10816-024-09642-z#ref-CR19

- en: Related to the previous points, a last aspect to consider is that votive anchors
    need not have been functional in an actual sea voyage. While the majority of anchors
    found in temples could have been used on board a ship, this is not always the
    case. As will become evident in the examples below, the impossibility of using
    a votive anchor on board the ship does not reduce its functionality within its
    sacred context. This implies that while morphologically very similar, votive anchors
    and secular ones are in fact different classes of objects with distinct—although
    related—properties. It is precisely in the conceptual integration, or blending,
    between the two domains of sacred and profane that the emergent properties of
    the votive anchors come into existence.

  zh: 关于前述点的相关内容，需要考虑的最后一个方面是，奉献锚不一定在实际航行中起功能作用。尽管寺庙中发现的大多数锚可能曾在船上使用过，但并非总是如此。正如下面的例子所示，在船上使用奉献锚的不可能性并不降低其在神圣语境中的功能。这意味着，虽然形态上非常相似，但奉献锚和世俗锚实际上是具有不同——尽管相关——属性的不同类对象。正是在神圣和世俗两个领域之间的概念整合或融合中，奉献锚的新兴属性得以形成。

    at Byblos, where the tradition dates as far back as the early third millennium
    BCE. In the Sacred Enclosure and in the Temple of Obelisks, thrteen stone anchors
    were found within the sacred precinct. Among these were three smaller ones that
    did not exceed 30 cm in height. Given their relatively light weight, they were
    interpreted as fishing tackle shaped to resemble the large triangular anchors

    anchors, along with other maritime votives distributed in various deposits. In
    the Tower Temple, the earliest phases of which can be dated to the EB II (c. 3000–2800

    a wide, regular passing hole as one would expect from typical Middle Bronze Age
    (MBA, c. 2000–1600 BCE) single-hole anchors. These were only finished on the upper

    largely relied on maritime trade, and this dependance was also manifested in devotional
    practices. Among the most interesting material evidence of the tie between Kition

    from Temples 1, 2, 4 and 5—this is the most numerous group of anchors recovered

    not only numerous, but they are among the largest on record, reaching up to 1350
    kg weight and 1.6 m height, roughly spanning from the Late Bronze Age to the Phoenician
    period. They are located in a variety of contexts within the sanctuary and can
    be either free standing or embedded in the temple architecture such as walls,
    thresholds, and altars. Similarly, they may be alone, or more frequently grouped

- en: The freestanding anchors are those to which a ritual/symbolic function may be
    more easily attributed. Especially clear is the case with anchors 947 (Room 12,
    Northern Workshops) and the fragmentary 4199 (Temple 5). Both were found upright
    and freestanding, with obvious signs of exposure to fire, in close association
    with burnt animal bones and bucrania, in what appears to be an offering installation.

  zh: 那些可归因于仪式/象征功能的独立站立锚，特别明显的是947号锚（12号房间，北部工作室）和残缺的4199号锚（5号庙宇）。它们都直立独立地被发现，明显显示出受火烧的迹象，并与烧焦的动物骨骼和牛头骨紧密关联，位于一个看似供奉装置的场所中。
- en: 'Several anchors were included into structures, of which at least 13 were used
    in the thresholds between various rooms in Temple 2 and in the Northern Workshops—it
    is perhaps significant that both thresholds and anchors can be interpreted in
    relation to liminality. In one case, two anchors (2610, 2611, Room 16, northern
    workshops) were found stacked on top of each other, with a third anchor (2609)
    perpendicular to the other two completing the configuration. It is possible that
    the rope hole of the top anchor could be used in libations to be held upon entering/leaving
    this particular room. There are a few instances of thresholds featuring pairs
    of anchors identical in shape and size that were made of a different type of stone—such
    as the case with 2612 and 2612A (Temple 2) or 946 and 946A (northern workshops).
    This strongly implies that the pairs were made at the same place, likely in one
    of the temple workshops, from material that had been brought from different sources.
    To support the suggestion of an *in situ* production, we also have incomplete
    and newly carved, unused anchors out of stones of foreign provenance (Forst, [1985](/article/10.1007/s10816-024-09642-z#ref-CR19
    "Frost, H. (1985). The Kition anchors. Appendix 1\. In V. Karageorghis & M. Demas,

    ‘fresh’ into the top layer of the stone foundations of the temple.'

  zh: 在神庙2和北部车间的各个房间之间的门槛上包含了几个锚，其中至少有13个被用于门槛，并且可能与界限性有关。在一个案例中，两个锚（2610、2611，16号房间，北部车间）被堆叠在一起，第三个锚（2609）垂直于其他两个，形成了完整的配置。顶部锚的绳孔可能被用于进入/离开特定房间时的奠祭。还有几个案例的门槛上有相同形状和大小的一对锚，由不同类型的石头制成，比如神庙2的2612和2612A，或北部车间的946和946A。这强烈暗示这些成对锚是在同一个地方制造的，可能是在其中一个神庙的车间，用来自不同来源的材料制成。为了支持现场制作的建议，我们还有未完成和新雕刻的锚，用外来石材制成（Forst，1985，Karageorghis
    & Demas的《Kition遗址V：I和II区域》附录1，《基托尼锚》）。这些也是新鲜地纳入到神庙石基的顶层中。
- en: Alignments of up to 6 anchors in the top course of the wall foundations can
    be observed in the northern workshops, in Temple 1, and are especially concentrated
    in Temple 4\. As mentioned above, anchors may also be used as column bases (2605–2607,
    room 16). It cannot be excluded that these last examples were originally deposited
    as individual votives, and were incorporated in the temple architecture at a later
    stage. It is still debated whether the number of anchors and their relation to
    each-other could be meaningful.

  zh: 在北部车间、神庙1和尤其是神庙4的墙基顶部，可以观察到多达6个锚的排列。如前所述，这些锚也可能被用作柱基（2605–2607，16号房间）。不能排除这些最后的例子最初是作为个别的祈祷品存放，并在后来的阶段被纳入神殿建筑中。关于锚的数量及其之间的关系是否具有意义仍在争论中。
- en: Other configurations include the anchors used as altar base in Temple 5 (4977,
    4978B/C), which show traces of fire exposure and were probably stand-alone offering
    installations before being incorporated in the altar. In other cases, there are
    anchors laid into the floor or in shallow pits, at times individually, other times
    in groups. In Room 15, four anchors are placed next to each-other into the floor
    with their rope-holes neatly aligned (944, 944A, 2603, and 2604). Finally, from
    Temple 1, there are also 6 smaller anchors, variously interpreted as miniature
    anchors, fishing weights, or diving weights that have an individual mass up to
    10 kg.

  zh: 其他配置包括用作神庙5的祭坛基座的锚（4977、4978B/C），显示出火灾暴露的痕迹，并且可能是在纳入祭坛之前作为独立的供奉设施。在其他情况下，锚被放置在地板上或浅坑中，有时是单独的，有时是成组的。在15号房间，四个锚被放置在地板上，它们的绳孔整齐排列（944、944A、2603和2604）。最后，在神庙1中，还有6个较小的锚，被各种解释为微型锚、渔具或潜水重物，其个体质量高达10公斤。
- en: 'Interestingly, as was the case at Ugarit and Byblos, none of the votive anchors
    from Kition shows clear signs of being ever used at sea (Frost, [1985](/article/10.1007/s10816-024-09642-z#ref-CR19
    "Frost, H. (1985). The Kition anchors. Appendix 1\. In V. Karageorghis & M. Demas,

    Department of Antiquities, Cyprus."), p. 290). This applies as much to the free
    standing votives as to those used as construction materials. We also have examples
    of unfinished anchors. Some were only finished on one side, or had only partially
    carved out rope holes, indicating, as already suggested by Frost, replicas rather
    than actual anchors. The presence of these unfinished specimens and of new anchors
    made of foreign stones further implies that at least some of the anchors were
    produced directly in the temple workshops.'

  zh: 有趣的是，与乌加里特和比比洛斯的情况类似，基特昂的祈愿锚没有明显显示过海上使用的迹象（Frost，[1985](/article/10.1007/s10816-024-09642-z#ref-CR19
    "Frost, H. (1985). 基特昂的锚。附录1。在V. Karageorghis和M. Demas，基特昂的发掘V：I和II区。1：前腓尼基时期的层次（第281-321页）。塞浦路斯文物局。"），第290页）。这一点适用于独立的祈愿锚和用作建筑材料的锚。我们还有未完成的锚的例子。有些只在一侧完成，或者只部分雕刻出绳孔，正如Frost已经提到的那样，这些更像是复制品而不是真实的锚。这些未完成的标本的存在，以及用外国石材制造的新锚的存在，进一步表明至少一些锚是直接在寺庙的工作坊中生产的。
