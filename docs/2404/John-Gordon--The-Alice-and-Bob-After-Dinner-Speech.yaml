    who are not experts in coding theory, but rather have been dragged here kicking

    they are concerned with the private lives of two people called Alice and Bob.
    In theory papers, whenever a coding theorist wants to describe a transaction between
    two parties he doesn't call then A and B. No. For some longstanding traditional
    reason he calls them Alice and Bob.

    From the number of stock market deals Bob is involved in we infer that he is probably
    a stockbroker. However from his concern about eavesdropping he is probably active
    in some subversive enterprise as well. And from the number of times Alice tries
    to buy stock from him we infer she is probably a speculator. Alice is also concerned
    that her financial dealings with Bob are not brought to the attention of her husband.
    So Bob is a subversive stockbroker and Alice is a two-timing speculator.

    a few words on the impact that information technology is having on our everyday
    lives.

- en: Science has marched ahead so fast that we take for granted the most incredible
    technological developments. Magnetrons, which were a closely guarded secret during
    the 1939-45 war are now part of every microwave cooker. And made in Japan. When
    I was a child, space travel was science fiction. Yet today, advance is so rapid
    that even the astronauts who set foot on the moon in 1969 had never seen a digital
    watch. Nor a pocket calculator.

- en: Pocket calculators! Now there's something. They're so complicated! I have a
    calculator which has sines, cosines, tangents, logarithms, hyperbolic functions
    and multiple nested parentheses. You can program it in Fortran, Algol, Basic,
    Pascal, Forth, Fifth and Sixth, ADA and Carruthers. It will factorize primes for
    you. At present it's working on the Halting Problem.

    Sometimes they organize a game of football between them.

    it. I tell it my problems. Sometimes it psychoanalyses me. It has me figured as
    paranoid. But that's just because it keeps getting at me. But don't get me wrong
    - it can be very user friendly. In fact you can program precisely HOW user friendly
    you want it is to be on a scale from ONE to TEN.

    on a setting of TEN it's so friendly that on a cold day it pre-heats its pushbuttons.

    started to go wrong. At first there was nothing definite. Nothing you could put
    your finger on. Just little things like stuttering. It just didn't sound quite
    the same. Its voice seemed to lack its former confidence.

    is lost in a dark forest.
