    they are concerned with the private lives of two people called Alice and Bob.
    In theory papers, whenever a coding theorist wants to describe a transaction between
    two parties he doesn't call then A and B. No. For some longstanding traditional
    reason he calls them Alice and Bob.

- en: In papers written by American authors Bob is frequently selling stock to speculators.
    From the number of stock market deals Bob is involved in we infer that he is probably
    a stockbroker. However from his concern about eavesdropping he is probably active
    in some subversive enterprise as well. And from the number of times Alice tries
    to buy stock from him we infer she is probably a speculator. Alice is also concerned
    that her financial dealings with Bob are not brought to the attention of her husband.
    So Bob is a subversive stockbroker and Alice is a two-timing speculator.

  zh: 在由美国作者撰写的论文中，Bob经常向投机者出售股票。根据Bob参与的股票交易数量，我们推断他可能是一名股票经纪人。然而，由于他对窃听的关注，他可能也在某些颠覆性企业中活跃。而Alice尝试从他那里购买股票的次数之多，我们推断她可能是一个投机者。Alice还担心她与Bob的财务交易不会引起丈夫的注意。所以Bob是一个颠覆性的股票经纪人，而Alice是一个两面派的投机者。
- en: But Alice has a number of serious problems. She and Bob only get to talk by
    telephone or by electronic mail. In the country where they live the telephone
    service is very expensive. And Alice and Bob are cheapskates. So the first thing
    Alice must do is MINIMIZE THE COST OF THE PHONE CALL.

    and Bob can hardly hear each other. On top of that Alice and Bob have very powerful
