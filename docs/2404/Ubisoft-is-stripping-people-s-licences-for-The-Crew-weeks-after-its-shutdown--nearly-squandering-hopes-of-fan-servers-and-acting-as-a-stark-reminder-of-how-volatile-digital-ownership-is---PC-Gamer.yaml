- en: The downside of digital ownership has reared its ugly head for enjoyers of [Ubisoft](https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s
    open-world multiplayer racer The Crew. The publisher has revoked its licence for
    those who owned it on Ubisoft Connect, almost destroying fan ambitions to revive
    the game in both an offline and online format.

    back in December, with Ubisoft revealing that the servers would be shut down at
    the beginning of April. Frustratingly, despite a large portion of the game being
    doable in singleplayer, The Crew remained an online-only endeavour throughout
    its decade-long lifespan. That had already rendered the game unplayable, but it
    seems Ubisoft is determined to take things one step further to stamp out any attempts
    to continue playing it past its expiry date.'

    snatched away from them. A message at the top of the game's library page reads,
    "You no longer have access to this game. Why not check the Store to pursue your
    adventures?" It's also been moved to its own individual section in player libraries,
    listed under "inactive games". Apparently booting the game directly from the installation
    directory will still launch the game, but only in a demo mode.

    most ruthless decision I've ever seen in gaming history," one Redditor [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz59uec/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    after a screenshot began circulating on the site. "I will always fight for digital
    media, I love all the advantages it gives to users all around the world. But this…
    we need protection on the national or European level, that when we purchase something,
    we need to have lifetime access to it. No matter what."

    "In an ideal world, revoking a license like this should entitle the buyer to a
    refund. I'm not sure why they're even bothering doing this. The game isn't playable
    anymore, so what exactly is the harm in keeping the game available for download
    for those who have purchased it? Server space? Is Ubisoft really that cheap?"

    and boot it up if they want—even if the game is technically dead—but it's another
    thing to revoke the licence to the files entirely. It came very close to putting
    a dent in plans to bring fan servers to the game, but one project appears to still
    be chugging along.

    if I hear back. I'll be interested to know if the publisher provides any solid
    reason for being extra thorough with its shutdown process. There's a good chance
    it has something to do with licensing—there are a good deal of licensed songs
    in The Crew, not to mention all of the real-world car manufacturers present, too.
    It could make for a sticky situation keeping the files around, and perhaps it
    was easier to try and kill the whole thing instead.

    ownership can be. A study by the Video Game History Foundation last year found
    that around [87% of games are unplayable](https://www.pcgamer.com/study-finds-over-87-percent-of-games-are-unplayable-without-resorting-to-piracy-scavenger-hunts-or-travelling-to-an-archive/)
    without diving into some kind of piracy or fan-created archive, and that number
    could even worsen as physical discs slowly die out. But preservation is becoming
    a bigger topic, one that's [now being taken more seriously](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/preserving-old-games-was-seen-as-a-non-commercial-art-project-until-recently-says-nightdive-director-they-were-great-then-and-theyre-great-now-and-companies-have-begun-to-realize-that/)

    called "Stop Killing Games" with The Crew as its primary example. His hope is
    to eventually win a legal victory that would require publishers to keep their
    live service games playable in some form after they end support, such as by releasing
    private servers.
