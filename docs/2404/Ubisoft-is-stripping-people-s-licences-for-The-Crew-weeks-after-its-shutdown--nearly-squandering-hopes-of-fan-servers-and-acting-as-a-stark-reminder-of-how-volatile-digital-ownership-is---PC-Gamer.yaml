- en: The downside of digital ownership has reared its ugly head for enjoyers of [Ubisoft](https://www.pcgamer.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s
    open-world multiplayer racer The Crew. The publisher has revoked its licence for
    those who owned it on Ubisoft Connect, almost destroying fan ambitions to revive
    the game in both an offline and online format.

  zh: 数码拥有权的缺点已经对《育碧》旗下开放世界多人赛车游戏《The Crew》的玩家产生了严重影响。该发行商已经取消了在育碧Connect平台上拥有此游戏许可的玩家的许可证，几乎使粉丝们重新开发该游戏的离线和在线模式的雄心毁于一旦。
- en: '[The Crew was pulled from sale](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/)
    back in December, with Ubisoft revealing that the servers would be shut down at
    the beginning of April. Frustratingly, despite a large portion of the game being
    doable in singleplayer, The Crew remained an online-only endeavour throughout
    its decade-long lifespan. That had already rendered the game unplayable, but it
    seems Ubisoft is determined to take things one step further to stamp out any attempts
    to continue playing it past its expiry date.'

  zh: 《The Crew》在去年12月停止销售，育碧透露该游戏的服务器将在4月初关闭。令人沮丧的是，尽管游戏的大部分内容都可以在单人模式下完成，《The Crew》在其长达十年的生命周期内始终是基于在线的。这已经使得游戏无法游玩，但育碧似乎决心更进一步，扼杀一切试图在游戏到期后继续玩下去的努力。
- en: Fans began to notice earlier in the week that the licence to the game had been
    snatched away from them. A message at the top of the game's library page reads,
    "You no longer have access to this game. Why not check the Store to pursue your
    adventures?" It's also been moved to its own individual section in player libraries,
    listed under "inactive games". Apparently booting the game directly from the installation
    directory will still launch the game, but only in a demo mode.

  zh: 早在这周早些时候，粉丝们已经注意到他们失去了游戏的许可证。游戏库页面上的一条消息写着：“你无法再访问这个游戏。为什么不去商店继续你的冒险呢？”它也被移动到玩家库的独立部分，列在“非活跃游戏”下。显然，直接从安装目录启动游戏仍然可以启动游戏，但只能以演示模式进行。
- en: The news has, unsurprisingly, gone down very poorly. "This was the saddest and

    if I hear back. I'll be interested to know if the publisher provides any solid
    reason for being extra thorough with its shutdown process. There's a good chance
    it has something to do with licensing—there are a good deal of licensed songs
    in The Crew, not to mention all of the real-world car manufacturers present, too.
    It could make for a sticky situation keeping the files around, and perhaps it
    was easier to try and kill the whole thing instead.

  zh: 我已经向育碧公司就这一情况请求评论，并将在收到回复后进行更新。我很感兴趣知道发行商是否提供了任何对他们关闭过程额外慎重的充分理由。很有可能与许可证有关——《The
    Crew》中有大量授权歌曲，更不用说所有真实世界汽车制造商了。这可能会让保存文件变得棘手，也许试图一并终止会更容易。
