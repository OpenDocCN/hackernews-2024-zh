    this process. And actually, Congress has actually dealt with this as well and
    passed an amendment that said no fund could be used for transgenic edible vaccines.
    This is a process that is being developed. But this bill merely would say that
    if that happens in the future, that food would have to be classified as a drug
    if it had a vaccine in it,” Hensley replied.

- en: “So while I feel like this legislation’s basically anodyne, I mean, I guess
    it’s addressing something that I can’t imagine whatever exists, which is the idea
    that we would somehow be putting vaccines into foods that you would buy in a grocery
    store. I mean, I can’t think of any logical reason why anyone would ever do that.
    And I do know that, you know, certainly, there have been experiments with putting
    vaccines in vegetables for the purposes of, of studying possible transmission
    methods. But the idea that this would somehow correlate to some kind of a retail
    offering of vegetables, especially when that vegetable would cost, you know, many
    thousands of dollars, just seems to me, I guess, messy, to be passing legislation
    for that reason. So I will be voting no,” Campbell added.

  zh: “所以虽然我觉得这项立法基本上是无害的，我是说，我想它正在解决我无法想象存在的事情，那就是我们会将疫苗放入你在杂货店买到的食物中的想法。我是说，我想不出任何逻辑上的理由，为什么有人会这样做。我确实知道，肯定地说，曾经有过将疫苗放入蔬菜中以研究可能的传播途径的实验。但是，我认为这种想法与某种零售蔬菜有关联的想法，尤其是当那种蔬菜的成本可能高达成千上万美元时，似乎对我来说是一种混乱的理由来通过立法。因此，我将投反对票，”坎贝尔补充道。

- en: “Actually I’ve been reading about data for a couple of years now and evidently
    with this new technology, they can raise this lettuce is what they’re talking
    about first. They can raise this stuff so cheap, and I’ve been reading about it
    talking about putting it in and lettuce and mass medicate everybody, like they
    do with fluoride in the water. I mean, who could control the dose? If you’re if
    you eat a lot of lettuce, you’re gonna get a lot of mRNA if you don’t eat any
    won’t get any. And they’re actually talking about other vegetables that they’re
    trying to put this in. And my question is, would this have to be sold at a drugstore?
    Would you still buy it in a grocery store? Why don’t we just outlaw this stuff
    completely? We don’t have any idea what its gonna do to our children? I mean,
    to us and old people anything? I mean, is this stuff locked out of a science fiction
    movie? I mean, it’s, it’s ridiculous. It’s changes your DNA, mRNA changes your
    DNA when if you have your DNA tested now, and you eat a bunch of this, lettuce
    take a bunch of these MRNA vaccines, and you go back and get your DNA tested again,
    it’s gonna be a little different. It’s not going to be the same as it was that
    you were born with that you got from your parents. This is dangerous stuff. We
    need to study it probably need to outlaw it. I mean, I can’t imagine. When I first
    read about this, I thought this can not be true. But you keep reading about it.
    And it is true,” Niceley said.
