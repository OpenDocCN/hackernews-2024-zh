    any of the ones I signed because they all include clauses that say I can''t do
    that, but read your own in detail. Also keep in mind that overly broad NDAs are
    often set aside by courts, so if you act reasonably you will not be attracting
    legal or ethical jeopardy.]'

- en: Let's say as part of working on X you learned a true fact like "A is faster
    than B" or "these screws don't rust in the environment X is deployed in" or "you
    should sharpen your chisel every day when carving this stuff". If you, while working
    on Y, say "for X we used A because it is faster" you are revealing information
    about X and possibly breaking your NDA. But if you say "A is faster here" or "these
    screws don't rust in [seawater or whatever]" or "did you sharpen your chisel today?"
    you are not.

- en: Most NDAs are much less enforceable than people think. They are often much less
    relevant also. Before something has been released, the information that it will
    have a particular feature is important and proprietary and should be protected.
    Once it's released, that is in the press release! Yes, other things stay secret
    indefinitely, but not every scrap of information you know qualifies.

- en: You should protect with the highest determination things like your old employer's
    future plans for X, the names and contact details of former fellow employees,
    the pricing and payment structures that were offered for X, what your fellow employees
    were paid, and other "inside details" of the business. You should also hold secret
    any super cool proprietary tricks that made X stand out from the rest - a different
    file format, a compression trick, something no one else has that made it somehow
    better in a way people didn't know the mechanics of. You can be pretty calm about
    having learned which sorting algorithm is faster, or the command line options
    for a commonly used product in your industry, or other things which are not so
    much "information about X" as they skills you have developed while working on
    X. To be "influenced by your knowledge of X" is not at all the same as "to tell
    people how X works internally."
