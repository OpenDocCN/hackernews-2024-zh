    years. There is a lot of data here – questions about family, school, work, life,
    health, relationships, and more. Most importantly, this data let’s me track people’s

    curve – and I’m saying that as someone who works with data all the time. That

    I have students stand up and group themselves by various traits – maybe it’s their
    age, where they’re from, or their favorite music genre. From there, I have them
    calculate something within their groups – average number of steps taken each day,
    average number of books read this year, average number of Instagram followers.
    It turns the students into datapoints, so they can experience data analysis with
    their bodies, rather than in a spreadsheet.

    in my heart because I learned Processing during grad school at [NYU ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp).
    Thanks to Professor Dan Shiffman (who has an amazing YouTube channel, [Coding
