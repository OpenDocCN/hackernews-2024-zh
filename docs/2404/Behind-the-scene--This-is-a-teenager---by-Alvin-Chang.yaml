    It’s a survey that follow people throughout their life, starting from their teenage
    years. There is a lot of data here – questions about family, school, work, life,
    health, relationships, and more. Most importantly, this data let’s me track people’s
    experiences and outcomes over time.

    that group is now in their 50s. And there’s another cohort that the survey started

    since their experiences reflect the current reality much more closely.

    Statistics actually has [a portal](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login%5C)
    that lets you create a subset of the data and download it. But there’s a learning
    curve – and I’m saying that as someone who works with data all the time. That
    said, once you understand how to access and understand the data, it yield an incredible
    amount of information.

    I have students stand up and group themselves by various traits – maybe it’s their
    age, where they’re from, or their favorite music genre. From there, I have them
    calculate something within their groups – average number of steps taken each day,
    average number of books read this year, average number of Instagram followers.
    It turns the students into datapoints, so they can experience data analysis with
    their bodies, rather than in a spreadsheet.

    I want, I’m going to use [P5.js](https://p5js.org/). This is a library that is
    basically the Javascript version of a programming language called [Processing](https://processing.org/).
    It’s a coding language geared toward visual artists, and it has a special place
    in my heart because I learned Processing during grad school at [NYU ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp).
    Thanks to Professor Dan Shiffman (who has an amazing YouTube channel, [Coding
    Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)), I learned how
    to code a crude physics engine to have my people icons run across the screen exactly
    how I want them to. If you’re interested in learning, [read this](https://natureofcode.com/).
