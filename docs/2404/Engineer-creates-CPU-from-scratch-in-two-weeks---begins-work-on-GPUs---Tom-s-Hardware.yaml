    two weeks, “with no prior experience.” During this brief period, [Adam Majmudar](https://twitter.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235769150423121)
    claims to have learned the fundamentals of [chip architecture](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-responds-to-sam-altmans-plan-to-raise-dollar7-billion-to-make-ai-chips),
    absorbed the finer points of [chip fabrication](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know),
    and prepared his first full chip layout using [EDA tools](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ai-tools-take-chip-design-industry-by-storm-200-chips-tape-out).
    The next step in his “speed-running the chip stack” to-do list is designing a
    GPU from scratch. When finished this project is destined for production via [Matthew
    Venn’s](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn) TinyTapeout 6.

    However, some of those feats have eaten through years of spare time for the people
    involved. Majmudar must be on vacation and spending all his surplus time on this
    “speed run” project to have gotten as far as he has “from scratch.”

    designing a GPU from scratch. He knows this will be a difficult task and admits
    that, after initial investigations, it is [harder than expected](https://twitter.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235788880420870).
    The fledgling chip designer explains that there simply aren’t the learning resources
    online for building a GPU. “Because GPU companies are all trying to keep their
    secrets from each other, most of the GPU architecture data is all proprietary
    and closed source,” the engineer finds.

    part of the project “way more fun for me.” Interestingly, Anthropic’s Claude Opus
    AI tools have been useful during this GPU designing stage. “I've been proposing
    my ideas for how each unit must work to Claude, and then somehow it will guide
    me toward the right implementation approaches which I can then go and confirm
    with open-source repos,” explained the engineer. However, he observed that “if
    I search some of the things publicly, nothing shows up which is a testament to
    how well hidden the implementation details are.”

    speed run, the above concerns expressed regarding GPUs might make readers worry
    that Majmudar may have hit a speed bump, a snag, or even a brick wall. That doesn’t
    seem to be the case, as he optimistically predicts that his GPU design will be
    shipping “in the next few days,” and a cut-down version sent to be taped out.

    we know it can take quite some time between submitting work to projects like TinyTapeout
    and the production run. The maker of the [Rickroll ASIC](https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/rickroll-asic-heralded-as-a-world-first-this-chip-is-never-gonna-let-you-down),
    for example, said there were nine months between submitting his design and receiving
    the silicon. Please note that [TT06](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/145/) closes
    just eight days from now.
