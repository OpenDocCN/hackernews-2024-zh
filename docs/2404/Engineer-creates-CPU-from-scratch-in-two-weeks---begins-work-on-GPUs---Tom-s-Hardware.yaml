- en: An engineer has shared his experience of designing a CPU from scratch, over
    two weeks, “with no prior experience.” During this brief period, [Adam Majmudar](https://twitter.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235769150423121)
    claims to have learned the fundamentals of [chip architecture](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-responds-to-sam-altmans-plan-to-raise-dollar7-billion-to-make-ai-chips),
    absorbed the finer points of [chip fabrication](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know),
    and prepared his first full chip layout using [EDA tools](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ai-tools-take-chip-design-industry-by-storm-200-chips-tape-out).
    The next step in his “speed-running the chip stack” to-do list is designing a
    GPU from scratch. When finished this project is destined for production via [Matthew
    Venn’s](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn) TinyTapeout 6.

    However, some of those feats have eaten through years of spare time for the people
    involved. Majmudar must be on vacation and spending all his surplus time on this
    “speed run” project to have gotten as far as he has “from scratch.”

- en: As we mentioned in the intro, the significant step that Majmudar now faces is
    designing a GPU from scratch. He knows this will be a difficult task and admits
    that, after initial investigations, it is [harder than expected](https://twitter.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235788880420870).
    The fledgling chip designer explains that there simply aren’t the learning resources
    online for building a GPU. “Because GPU companies are all trying to keep their
    secrets from each other, most of the GPU architecture data is all proprietary
    and closed source,” the engineer finds.

  zh: 如我们在简介中提到的那样，Majmudar现在面临的主要挑战是自研GPU。他知道这将是一项艰难的任务，并承认初步调查后发现这比预期的更为困难([来自Twitter的记载](https://twitter.com/MajmudarAdam/status/1778235788880420870))。这位起步中的芯片设计师解释道，网上没有足够的在线学习资源可以用于构建GPU。这位工程师发现：“因为GPU公司都在努力保守各自的秘密，大部分GPU架构数据都是专有的和封闭源的。”
- en: Despite this hurdle, Majmudar says the big GPU-makers’ secrecy has made this
    part of the project “way more fun for me.” Interestingly, Anthropic’s Claude Opus
    AI tools have been useful during this GPU designing stage. “I've been proposing
    my ideas for how each unit must work to Claude, and then somehow it will guide
    me toward the right implementation approaches which I can then go and confirm
    with open-source repos,” explained the engineer. However, he observed that “if
    I search some of the things publicly, nothing shows up which is a testament to
    how well hidden the implementation details are.”

  zh: 尽管存在这一挑战，Majmudar表示，大型GPU制造商的保密行为，让此项目的这一部分“对我来说更加有趣”。值得注意的是，Anthropic的Claude
    Opus AI工具在这一GPU设计阶段非常有用。“我向Claude提出了我如何让各个组件工作的想法，然后有些如何正确实施的思路就被引导了出来，随后我就可以通过开源库进行验证。”工程师解释道。然而，他观察到“如果我查找一些公开信息，结果一片空白，这表明了如何实施的细节被隐藏得多深。”
- en: After taking just two weeks or so to get through three out of five legs of his
    speed run, the above concerns expressed regarding GPUs might make readers worry
    that Majmudar may have hit a speed bump, a snag, or even a brick wall. That doesn’t
    seem to be the case, as he optimistically predicts that his GPU design will be
    shipping “in the next few days,” and a cut-down version sent to be taped out.

  zh: 在成功完成三段中的其中三段、五段挑战中的三段之后，所表达的对于GPU的担忧可能会让读者感到，Majmudar 可能遇到了障碍、阻碍甚至是一堵无法逾越的墙。但这似乎并非真实情况，因为他乐观地预测，他的GPU设计将在“接下来的几天内”出货，并寄送一个简化版进行原型制作。
- en: It may be well worth keeping an eye open for this engineer’s next updates. However,
    we know it can take quite some time between submitting work to projects like TinyTapeout
    and the production run. The maker of the [Rickroll ASIC](https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/rickroll-asic-heralded-as-a-world-first-this-chip-is-never-gonna-let-you-down),
    for example, said there were nine months between submitting his design and receiving
    the silicon. Please note that [TT06](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/145/) closes
    just eight days from now.

  zh: 留意这位工程师的后续更新可能非常值得。然而，我们知道从提交工作到项目如TinyTapeout的生产运行之间，中间可能会经过相当长的时间。例如，制作了[里克滚动ASIC](https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/rickroll-asic-heralded-as-a-world-first-this-chip-is-never-gonna-let-you-down)的制作者表示，他的设计提交后到收到硅片这段时间共有九个月。请注意，[TT06](https://tinytapeout.com/runs/tt02/145/)将在如今后仅剩八天结束。
