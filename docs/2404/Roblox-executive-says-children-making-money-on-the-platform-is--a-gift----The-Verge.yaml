- en: '*Roblox*, one of the most popular gaming platforms in the world, has taken
    a lot of heat from critics who accuse it of exploiting its users, the vast majority
    of whom are children and teenagers. In a recent [interview with *Eurogamer*](https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift),
    however, *Roblox*’s studio head, Stefano Corazza, said the platform has actually
    been a gift to the young developers who make money by creating games on the platform.'

    can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a
    job, and even like an income,” Corazza said. “So I can be like, 15 years old,
    in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now with just a laptop, I can create
    something, make money, and then sustain my life.” (An unidentified *Roblox* PR
    person present during the interview told *Eurogamer* that most of the developers
    earning money on *Roblox* are 18 or older.)'

    currency, which can be redeemed for cash. As *Eurogamer* notes, *Roblox* also
    sells Robux at a much higher price than it pays forthem: a user can buy 1,000
    Robux for $12.50 but can cash out 1,000 Robux for just $3.50\. Users can also
    use Robux elsewhere on the internet — including [online gambling websites](/2024/4/3/24120358/roblox-robux-illegal-gambling-online-casinos-lawsuit-section-230),
    according to a lawsuit two parents filed against *Roblox* last August.'

- en: '*Roblox*, for its part, has made recent overtures to legislators as part of
    a broader effort to prove it’s taking children’s safety seriously. “Obviously,
    everyone wants to keep kids safe,” *Roblox* CEO and co-founder David Baszucki
    [told *The Verge’s* Alex Heath](/2024/4/4/24121362/roblox-heads-to-washington).
    “It has been something we’ve always focused on. And so we wanted to be a resource
    for legislators as they start thinking about laws.”'

    that affects kids’ internet use — and that will affect *Roblox* as well.
