    The driver has to remain alert and pay attention to the road and other road users.

    being driven in the overtaking lane without overtaking anyone. The other Tesla

    continued to sleep while the car ”drove by itself.” At last, the driver woke up
    and the Tesla suddenly turned to the right. The driver of the police car had to
    swerve and brake in order not to crash.
