# Welcome to Zint

The Zint project aims to provide a complete cross-platform open source barcode generating solution. The package currently consists of a Qt based GUI, a CLI command line executable and a library with an API to allow developers access to the capabilities of Zint. It is hoped that Zint provides a solution which is flexible enough for professional users while at the same time takes care of as much of the processing as possible to allow easy translation from input data to barcode image.
