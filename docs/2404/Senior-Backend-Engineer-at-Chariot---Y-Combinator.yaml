    to be mostly based on our eng team’s availability. That said, we have moved more
    quickly and look to accommodate candidates who might have a short timeline or
    competing offers. The more information you can share about your situation and
    where you are in the process, the more we can either attempt to expedite/match,
    or save you time if we cannot.

    the financial infrastructure that connects these complex charitable assets to
    nonprofits. Chariot is doing for charitable transactions what Visa did for the
    entire banking industry in the 1950s. Every line of code pushed helps move millions
    of dollars to charity.

    philanthropy. However, millions of DAF users are stuck behind archaic login portals,
    emails, or even phone calls to make a donation.

    a pair of new shoes. How much less likely would you be to get those sneakers?
    Today, that’s what it’s like to donate with a DAF. It is estimated that this current
    friction represents $395B in unrealized donations over the next decade. Chariot’s
    easy-to-use payment option reduces the DAF donation process to just a few clicks.
