    moments. The original legend is that [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes)
    exclaimed ‘Eureka', Greek for ‘I have found it’ when he realized that the volume
    of water displaced from his bath must equal the volume of his own body. Archimedes
    reportedly used his discovery to test whether a golden crown had been debased
    with cheaper silver.

    EUREKA in one of his notebooks on the discovery of the proof of a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_polygonal_number_theorem#:~:text=Gauss%20proved%20the%20triangular%20case,known%20as%20the%20Eureka%20theorem.)

    a representative motto. … Since the seal’s design included a gold miner, it seemed
    most fitting to the delegates to adopt this phrase as the State Motto. It became
    the official State Motto in 1963\. Seventeen California locations bear the name
    Eureka.

    the development of the modern integrated circuit. Like Gauss’s discovery, it’s
    documented in a handwritten notebook.

    at Texas Instruments in September 1958, and then independently, a few months later,
    by [Robert Noyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce) at Fairchild Semiconductor.

    was the development of the ‘planar process’ for manufacturing transistors by [Jean
    Hoerni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hoerni), a physicist colleague of Noyce’s
    at Fairchild. Hoerni had been born in Switzerland and educated there and in the
    U.K. After traveling to the U.S., he worked at Shockley Semiconductor before joining
    Noyce and Gordon Moore as one of the ‘traitorous eight’ engineers who left Shockley
    to found Fairchild Semiconductor.
