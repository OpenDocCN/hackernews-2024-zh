- en: System/360’s software was also ambitious. Variations of one operating system,
    OS/360, were supposed to run on all the models.

    that ran several programs at once -- and it was late. Three special OSs had to
    be created for the smallest machines.

- en: In addition to the underlying principle of compatibility, System/360 incorporated
    many hardware advances, including options for very large main memories and Solid
    Logic Technology (hybrid integrated circuits).

    that would otherwise need special hardware – key to making the smaller models
    do everything.
