# Long Covid blood clues could prompt future trials - BBC News

The researchers behind the study, in Nature Immunology, also found some proteins in the blood of those with long Covid could be linked to their specific symptoms.

For example, those with gastrointestinal symptoms had increased levels of a marker called SCG3, previously linked to impaired communication between the gut and the brain.

This could help divide long Covid patients into different sub-groups and be useful for designing clinical trials, especially for treatments targeting immune responses and inflammation, the researchers said.

Imperial College London clinical-research fellow Dr Felicity Liew said the findings suggested inflammation "could be a common feature of long Covid after hospitalisation, regardless of symptom type".

And this may open the door to existing drugs being tried against long Covid, such as those for rheumatoid arthritis, an auto-immune condition causing inflammation of the joints.

Lead research Prof Peter Openshaw said: "This work provides strong evidence that long Covid is caused by post-viral inflammation but shows layers of complexity.

"We hope that our work opens the way to the development of specific tests and treatments for the various types of long Covid and believe that a 'one size fits all' approach to treatment may not work."
