Thank you very much for supporting our products.

At 5pm PDT on April 8, 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication was discontinued for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software, including software exclusive to New Nintendo 3DS. This also includes online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.

You can find more information about badges for decorating the Nintendo 3DS HOME Menu using Nintendo Badge Arcade .

We sincerely thank players for using the online services of Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software over a long period of time and apologize for any inconvenience.

## Q&A

Yes. Players are still able to use features and game modes that do not require online communication.

It will still be possible to use online services for the following software but that may also end at some point in the future.

*   Pokémon Bank
*   Poké Transporter

With some exceptions, online services have ended for all Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Please contact publishers for information about the online services for their software.

For the foreseeable future, it is still possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.

StreetPass uses local communication between Nintendo 3DS family systems, meaning that it is still available even after online services ended. However, because SpotPass uses online communication, SpotPass features are longer available.

For example, you are still able to use StreetPass in *StreetPass Mii Plaza*, which is pre-installed on Nintendo 3DS family systems, but you are no longer able to use features that use online communication (such as receiving new panels in Puzzle Swap).
