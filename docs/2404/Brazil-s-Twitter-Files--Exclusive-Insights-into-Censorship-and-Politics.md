En: Fwd: Electoral Court Order - BR Superior Court of Justice

We received a new court order in the scope of this investigation. Short recap: this is an inquiry with the aim to identify individuals/groups behind a potential coordination of efforts to attack the institutions and the electoral system across different platforms. President Bolsonaro himself is investigated in this process, there is great public attention to this case as well as a legitimate concern with the integrity of the democratic system. We have received several unusual requests coming from this inquiry, the most recent one compelling us to provide an undetermined amount of user data based on hashtag mentions. The hashtags concern a mobilization around the elections - roughly translated as #PrintedVoteNO; #DemocraticAuditableVote and #BarrosoInJail - Barroso is the former TSE President. We were able to narrow down the request, with the Federal Police specifying what they wanted after a meeting.

Now, the Superior Electoral Court ordered Twitter to disclose, in 5 days, data related to users that posted tweets with the #BarrosoNaCadeia, between 00h00 and 15h59 (BRT) on August 3, 2021; #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel between 14h and 19h59 on August 3, 2021; and #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel between 22h00 and 22h59 on August 10, 2021\. The data requested is: a breakdown of the last IP log of access right before the user posted the tweet(s) with such hashtag(s) - which is not available, and the specific tweet with applicable hashtag.

In the past, Site Integrity provided us with the hashtag report, the initial pull of data and content and the table with the results of such pull, which based our conversation with the police authority.

We already have the tweets posted with the hashtags #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel on such dates and will request LP to produce the data accordingly, but, considering the amount of tweets posted with the hashtag #BarrosoNaCadeia on August 3, 2021 (40,800, as provided in tab I-B of the results document), Site Integrity did not provide us with copies of such tweets at the time.

However, considering this new court order, we need this content in order to comply with the disclosure order and check which users are subject of the data disclosure determination. According to the report we currently have, there were 182 tweets in the period of interest:

We need the content, user handles and respective BSI data asap, but please let us know how much time you estimate the team would be able to complete this pull, and also if there are any concerns or difficulties regarding this request. Our formal deadline to respond is 5 days (next Monday), but since we have a good relationship with them, we could ask for an extension.

We would just like to highlight that this case is high priority and sensitive, as you know, and while we understand that it may take a toll on the team, we also know how important it is to comply or, at least, have grounds to challenge the determination. Here is the background document on this entire investigation - updated with this new development.
