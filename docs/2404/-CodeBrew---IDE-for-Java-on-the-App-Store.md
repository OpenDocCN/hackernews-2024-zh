# ‎CodeBrew - IDE for Java on the App Store

> This app is great for anyone new to Java, especially if you’re learning on an iPad. It’s very easy to use, which is perfect for beginners. One special thing about this app is that you can use it without the internet to make apps that have buttons and menus (graphical user interfaces or GUIs). This is something not all apps like this can do. It also has examples to help you understand how to do things.

> Since this app is quite new, there are a few small problems, like sometimes it doesn’t show mistakes correctly. But overall, it does a good job. If there were more design options and a way to make your own shortcuts for tasks like fixing errors (debugging), it would be even better. Adding a feature to quickly switch between open tabs, maybe by showing them at the top, would make working on different parts of your project much easier and faster.
