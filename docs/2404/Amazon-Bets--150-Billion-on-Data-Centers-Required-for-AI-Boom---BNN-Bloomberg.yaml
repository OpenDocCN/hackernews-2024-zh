- en: (Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. plans to spend almost $150 billion in the coming
    15 years on data centers, giving the cloud-computing giant the firepower to handle
    an expected explosion in demand for artificial intelligence applications and other
    digital services.

- en: The spending spree is a show of force as the company looks to maintain its grip
    on the cloud services market, where it holds about twice the share of No. 2 player
    Microsoft Corp. Sales growth at Amazon Web Services slowed to a record low last
    year as business customers cut costs and delayed modernization projects. Now spending
    is starting to pick up again, and Amazon is keen to secure land and electricity
    for its power-hungry facilities.

    president who oversees the company’s data centers. “I think that just gives us

    to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The
    company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon
    as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.

    and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related
    spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined
    to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different
    costs in their estimates.

    shrank 2% in 2023—for the first time—even as Microsoft boosted its own spending
    by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell’Oro Group. But Amazon’s
    chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase
    this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.

    for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along
    with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power
    required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence.

    software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own
    tools to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power
    AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions
    of dollars in AI-related revenue.

    Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial
    hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened
    data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric
    power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four
    of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.

- en: Amazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it’s getting
    harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their
    growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion
    Energy Inc., which powers Virginia’s data center alley, couldn’t keep up, pausing
    connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility
    expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven
    primarily by data centers.

    share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural
    gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year.

    that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project
    is because there’s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,”
    said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman
    & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.

    campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history,
    AWS’s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively
    little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta.

    and electrical substation next to a delivery depot  on a slice of a former ranch
    the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds,
    it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece
    of land.

    to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents
    complain about server farms’ incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling
    facilities’ encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance
    are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers
    come online—whether they are built by Amazon or not.

- en: Renewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given
    new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped
    make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay
    to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate
    the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate
    for decades.

    force the utilities to change their behavior,” said Daniel Tait, research and
    communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog
    that backs renewables. “Not only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they
    are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.”

    energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity
    by 2025\. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between
    supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid.

    clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and
    nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work
    with utilities and find a way to “match our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free
    power.”
