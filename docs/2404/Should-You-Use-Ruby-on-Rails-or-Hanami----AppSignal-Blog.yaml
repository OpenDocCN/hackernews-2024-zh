    how each is built and their application architecture is where you'll find most
    of the differences.
  id: totrans-split-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For starters, with Rails, you have fewer files or *abstractions* (the building
    blocks you use to build your app), which tend to grow in size as you develop your
    app. On the other hand, Hanami takes abstractions to a whole new level, with lots
    of files that tend to be smaller in size.

    (MVC) structure. However, Hanami takes abstraction to the next level.
  id: totrans-split-23

  id: totrans-split-24

- en: '**Routes** - Each framework has a routes definition with your app''s endpoints.'
  id: totrans-split-25
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Controllers vs. actions** - In Rails, you get controllers with one or a couple
    of actions in them. Controllers receive and respond to route requests by directing
    them to the relevant actions. In Hanami, there are no controllers. Instead, you
    go straight to self-contained actions (each action has its own self-contained
    class).'
  id: totrans-split-26
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Models and persistence** - The Rails model layer takes care of data validation
    and database communication, including any queries your app may have. Persistence is
    handled by the Ruby Object Mapper (ROM). In Hanami, the model layer is more abstract,
    separated into entities and repositories. Entities handle domain logic and are
    database-agnostic, whereas *repositories* (repos) are used to communicate with
    the database. Hanami 2.0 onwards ships without a pre-configured persistence layer,
    allowing you to choose an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that suits your needs
    or program ORM free.'

- en: '**View rendering** - As with the persistence layer, Ruby on Rails views tend
    to contain everything you need for rendering data to the outside world in one
    place. This includes all the HTML structure, view helpers, and view logic. When
    it comes to view rendering in Hanami, things are more abstract. For starters,
    you have *views* that utilize any view helpers the app has and also render the
    *template*. The *template* handles the actual HTML structure, while the *parts*
    take care of any presentation logic.'

- en: So, what does all this mean when it comes to building an app? With fewer abstractions,
    Rails is a good choice for getting your app off the ground and is more beginner-friendly
    (as we shall see later on in this article). With Rails, you can build very robust
    monolith apps, but your code will get more and more complex as you scale. On the
    other hand, Hanami's more complex structure can be daunting to learn, but it will
    allow you to build massively scalable applications and could make for much better
    code organization.

    a new programming language. Your very first thought will be to check out online
    learning resources. If a framework has widely available learning materials covering
    the app-building process from start to finish, you''ll likely choose that language
    over others. And because Rails has a more established documentation base, it trumps
    Hanami as the beginner''s choice of framework. In addition, Rails is much more
    friendly for beginners to pick up since it makes so many assumptions under the
    hood (compared to Hanami, which offers a more abstract way of building apps).
    Hanami''s abstractions can be daunting even for established Rails developers.'

    lists some big-name organizations using the framework. On the other hand, as the
    new kid on the block, Hanami is not so widely adopted. We''ll have to wait and

    future, he would push for Rails to offer first-class support for building full-stack
    progressive web applications and native notifications. These features would make
    Rails very attractive to mobile developers.
