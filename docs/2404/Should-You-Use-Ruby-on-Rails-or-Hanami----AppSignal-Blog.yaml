- en: Ruby on Rails is the most popular web framework in the Ruby ecosystem and has
    a large user base, ranging from freelancers to large established companies. With
    an active user community and wide-ranging documentation, it can be used to build
    everything from simple applications to complex web platforms.

    Ruby framework title: Hanami. It is a fast, modular Ruby framework with improved
    performance and maintainability compared to Rails.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this article, we'll explore the strengths and weaknesses of each framework
    in terms of performance, features, testing, and more. So whether you are looking
    to build a customer-facing web app, an internal tool, or a massively scalable
    API, you should leave being better informed about what to use for your next project.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Introducing Ruby on Rails
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) is the
    most well-known Ruby web application development framework with a mission to enhance
    developer productivity (by making a bunch of assumptions about how apps should
    be built, often referred to as the "Rails way").'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of these assumptions include making sure developers do not spend time configuring
    stuff, or what is termed as "convention over configuration", and an emphasis on
    using DRY ("don't repeat yourself") principles. DRY principles encourage a developer
    to avoid repeating code over and over again, but instead use single and focused
    representations of app functionality to ensure maintainability and organization.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Rails is very well-known in the Ruby community, [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/)
    is less so. It's a fairly new modern Ruby framework trying to take on Rails' dominance
    of the full-stack web framework space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hanami is built from the ground up to have a small memory footprint and a focus
    on modularity, which, in turn, makes for a very fast and nimble framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, these brief introductions won't really give you all the information
    you need to decide on the framework that suits you best. For that, we'll need
    to dive deeper into each, starting with how they are structured.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Structure and Architecture of Rails and Hanami
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rails and Hanami are somewhat similar in that both are Ruby frameworks. However,
    how each is built and their application architecture is where you'll find most
    of the differences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For starters, with Rails, you have fewer files or *abstractions* (the building
    blocks you use to build your app), which tend to grow in size as you develop your
    app. On the other hand, Hanami takes abstractions to a whole new level, with lots
    of files that tend to be smaller in size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The diagrams below illustrate the point more clearly. Let's start with Rails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now compare the Rails abstraction diagram with the Hanami one below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can see, each framework generally follows the *model-view-controller*
    (MVC) structure. However, Hanami takes abstraction to the next level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here''s a simplified outline of how each framework is organized:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Routes** - Each framework has a routes definition with your app''s endpoints.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Controllers vs. actions** - In Rails, you get controllers with one or a couple
    of actions in them. Controllers receive and respond to route requests by directing
    them to the relevant actions. In Hanami, there are no controllers. Instead, you
    go straight to self-contained actions (each action has its own self-contained
    class).'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Models and persistence** - The Rails model layer takes care of data validation
    and database communication, including any queries your app may have. Persistence is
    handled by the Ruby Object Mapper (ROM). In Hanami, the model layer is more abstract,
    separated into entities and repositories. Entities handle domain logic and are
    database-agnostic, whereas *repositories* (repos) are used to communicate with
    the database. Hanami 2.0 onwards ships without a pre-configured persistence layer,
    allowing you to choose an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that suits your needs
    or program ORM free.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**View rendering** - As with the persistence layer, Ruby on Rails views tend
    to contain everything you need for rendering data to the outside world in one
    place. This includes all the HTML structure, view helpers, and view logic. When
    it comes to view rendering in Hanami, things are more abstract. For starters,
    you have *views* that utilize any view helpers the app has and also render the
    *template*. The *template* handles the actual HTML structure, while the *parts*
    take care of any presentation logic.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what does all this mean when it comes to building an app? With fewer abstractions,
    Rails is a good choice for getting your app off the ground and is more beginner-friendly
    (as we shall see later on in this article). With Rails, you can build very robust
    monolith apps, but your code will get more and more complex as you scale. On the
    other hand, Hanami's more complex structure can be daunting to learn, but it will
    allow you to build massively scalable applications and could make for much better
    code organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, let's take a look at each framework's ecosystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ecosystem and Community
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we mentioned earlier, Rails has a more established framework than Hanami.
    Rails has been around for longer and, as such, has a bigger and more mature community.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The differences in ecosystem and community are summarized below:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Documentation** - It doesn''t matter what you''re trying to build, if you
    use Rails, you have access to very well-done documentation. You are guided through
    all parts of an app build, from authentication, to data persistence, view presentation,
    and everything in between. Additionally, a wide range of third-party tutorials
    cover almost everything imaginable in terms of building an application.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, things are not so established on the Hanami side of things. Being
    a relatively newer framework, Hanami has a comparatively limited documentation
    base. The Hanami team has done an impressive job with the official guides, but
    compared to the Rails documentation base, it doesn't come close.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Community** - Here, as with the documentation, Rails is the clear winner.
    Rails has been around much longer than Hanami, so it''s been adopted the most.
    It doesn''t matter whether you are a beginner or advanced developer, you''ll find
    a Rails community on relevant subreddits, Slack groups, Discords, and so forth.
    On the other hand, Hanami is still growing, meaning it has a much smaller community.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Gems and libraries** - Since both Hanami and Rails are Ruby frameworks, it
    could be argued that gems that work in Rails will work in Hanami. Although this
    is technically true, you''ll often find that Rails has a more established base
    of gems and libraries for all sorts of specialized functions.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, because of Hanami's focus on abstractions and specialization, it
    has some very advanced gems that could take your Rails apps to the next level.
    For example, the default [dry-rb gems](https://dry-rb.org/) in Hanami could bring
    better code organization and abstraction when used in Rails apps.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For the very reasons outlined in the previous section, Ruby on Rails easily
    beats Hanami in terms of ease of use, industry adoption, and learning curve, specifically:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Learning** - Imagine you''re a complete beginner who''s looking to learn
    a new programming language. Your very first thought will be to check out online
    learning resources. If a framework has widely available learning materials covering
    the app-building process from start to finish, you''ll likely choose that language
    over others. And because Rails has a more established documentation base, it trumps
    Hanami as the beginner''s choice of framework. In addition, Rails is much more
    friendly for beginners to pick up since it makes so many assumptions under the
    hood (compared to Hanami, which offers a more abstract way of building apps).
    Hanami''s abstractions can be daunting even for established Rails developers.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Industry adoption** - Without including the adoption of other popular and
    more established frameworks like Python, React, C#, and others, if we consider
    the adoption of Ruby frameworks, Rails easily eclipses Hanami. The [Rails homepage](https://rubyonrails.org/)
    lists some big-name organizations using the framework. On the other hand, as the
    new kid on the block, Hanami is not so widely adopted. We''ll have to wait and
    see whether that will change in the future.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Job market prospects** - In terms of job prospects, you''ll find more job
    openings for Rails developers than Hanami developers.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Governance** - Another important aspect that should not be overlooked is
    governance. A changing landscape guides how open-source frameworks evolve and
    advance. However, more than that, the core team members of these frameworks often
    wield immense powers and can dictate what goes into a framework, how it develops,
    etc.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good example is [January's announcement](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1743664413964374505)
    by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the creator of Rails. He said that, in the
    future, he would push for Rails to offer first-class support for building full-stack
    progressive web applications and native notifications. These features would make
    Rails very attractive to mobile developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In reaction, many developers, some outside the Ruby ecosystem and even others
    who had dropped Rails over the years, overwhelmingly responded in the positive,
    saying they would gladly pick up the framework or learn it if DHH kept his word.
    This example just goes to show you that governance is a very important consideration
    when deciding what framework to pick.

    and how it will utilize server resources once deployed in production. These are
    fundamental concerns that can greatly affect your choice of framework.
