- en: NASA’s LRO ([Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://www.nasa.gov/lro)), which
    has been circling and studying the Moon for 15 years, captured several images
    of Korea Aerospace Research Institute’s Danuri lunar orbiter last month. The two
    spacecraft, traveling in nearly parallel orbits, zipped past each other in opposite
    directions between March 5 and 6, 2024.

    captured the images featured here during three orbits that happened to be close
    enough to Danuri’s to grab snapshots.

- en: Due to the fast relative velocities between the two spacecraft (about 7,200
    miles, or 11,500 kilometers, per hour), the LRO operations team at NASA’s Goddard
    Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, needed exquisite timing in pointing
    LROC to the right place at the right time to catch a glimpse of Danuri, the Republic
    of Korea’s first spacecraft at the Moon. Danuri has been in lunar orbit since
    December 2022\. Although LRO’s camera exposure time was very short, only 0.338
    milliseconds, Danuri still appears smeared to 10 times its size in the opposite
    direction of travel because of the relative high travel velocities between the
    two spacecraft.
