    highs, so there can’t be a supply crisis. For some number of reasons, a lot of
    people are just resistant to the supply story. To someone seeking anti-supply
    talking points, it seems like a really good point. I have written a little bit

    size declined sharply from the 1960s through the 1980s. A small portion of that

  zh: 在这里，我想深入讨论[家庭规模](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html)。家庭规模基本上是每人住房数的反面。从1960年代到1980年代，家庭规模急剧下降。其中一小部分是因为更多的成年人独自生活，但几乎全部是由于儿童减少（图2）。
- en: Also, you can see here how Figure 1 truncates the y-axis. Average household
    size is basically the reciprocal of homes per capita. You can see here that if
    Figure 1 was extended to the 1970s, it would look like a flat line since the 2000s.
    Though, still it is true that homes per capita is at an all time high and average
    household size is at an all time low.

- en: Basically, adults were becoming a larger portion of the total population, so
    we had to expand the housing supply much faster than population growth because

    homes shipped) annually, as a percentage of the existing stock of homes. Population
    growth was about 1% for the whole period from 1965 to 2008, but from the 60s to
    the 80s, the housing stock was being expanded by 2% or 3% annually to house all
    those extra households.

- en: After 2008, population growth dropped to about three-quarters of a percent for
    a few years and then after about 2016, dropped again to about a half percent.
    Then it dropped to nearly zero during the pandemic. It has recovered back to about
    a half percent, and with strong demand for immigration, that seems like it is
    likely to persist for a while. (Obviously there is big talk about that in the
    presidential campaign. I’m not oblivious to that, but I’m not going to go into
    that here.)

  zh: 2008年后，人口增长率减少到约百分之三分之一，然后大约在2016年后再次下降到约半个百分点。然后在大流行期间几乎降至零。它已经恢复到约半个百分点，并且由于对移民的强烈需求，这似乎可能会持续一段时间。（显然，这在总统竞选中是大谈特谈的话题。我不是对此视而不见，但我不会在这里进一步讨论。）
- en: So, the big numbers of housing production in the 1970s were sort of a one-time
    spike of demand that can’t really happen again and that doesn’t need to be repeated.
    On the other hand, the chart makes clear how ridiculous the 2000s bubble stories
    are. The housing glut thesis that was canonized was completely unempirical. There
    is nothing in the history of housing markets to suggest that there is some tipping
    point where demand becomes inelastic in an oversupplied condition. And if there
    was, there was nothing about production levels in 2005 that would have triggered
    such a condition. Americans believed something that couldn’t possibly be true,
    and the economics profession, as a whole, was useless as a corrective.

  zh: 因此，20 世纪 70 年代的住房大量生产其实是一次性的需求高峰，不可能再次发生，也不需要重复。另一方面，图表清楚地表明了 2000 年代的泡沫故事是多么荒谬。那些奉为经典的住房供应过剩论完全没有经验证据支持。住房市场的历史并没有显示出某个需求过剩条件下需求变得无弹性的临界点。即使存在这样的情况，2005
    年的生产水平也不足以引发这种条件。美国人相信了一些根本不可能成立的东西，而整个经济学界作为修正的角色毫无用处。
- en: There was already a regional dearth of housing before 2008, but even with the
    decline in population growth, the lack of production after 2008 created a sizeable

    to be treated as a measure that reverts to a constant. Obviously, historically,
    in the US, it hasn’t been remotely constant, and internationally, it also changes
    over time more often than it is stable. This is a statistical error. If your model
    conclusions depend on assuming a constant level of homes per capita then your

- en: Also, these household size numbers are based on occupied units. Vacant homes
    don’t contain a household, so they don’t affect the average household size metric.
    But, since 2008, vacancies have been declining steeply. Lacking adequate new construction,
    we have been harvesting vacant units. Vacancy rates are basically down to the
    minimum functional level now, so there isn’t much more to be utilized there.

  zh: 另外，这些家庭规模数据是基于已占用单位计算的。空置房屋不包含家庭，因此它们不会影响平均家庭规模指标。但是，自 2008 年以来，空置率急剧下降。由于缺乏足够的新建筑，我们一直在利用空置单位。现在空置率基本降至最低功能水平，因此在这方面没有更多可以利用的余地。

- en: Richer economies have tended to have fewer children. But, richer economies also
    tend to have more vacant homes - second homes, vacation homes, homes rented to

    “We don’t have a supply problem. If we tax vacancies, keep foreigners from buying
    pieds-à-terre, and ban Airbnb’s, we’d have plenty of homes.” Those complaints
    tend to be made with a tone that is in objection to supply-centered narratives,
    but they really are confirmations of the point that we lack supply. Really, they
    aren’t economic arguments. They are cultural arguments. They are simply steps
    in the process of authoritarian control that would be necessary to maintain the
