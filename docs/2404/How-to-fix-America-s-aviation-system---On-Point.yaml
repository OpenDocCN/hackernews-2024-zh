    a.m. on a foggy morning in Austin. And the entire interaction is about four minutes
    long. We're going to hear significant sections of it, and here's how it starts.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    tower about a plane approaching for a landing.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'RINALDI: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. FedEx is telling the pilot, the tower, that
    they''re going to do a CAT III approach, which is the most intense approach.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's an instrument landing approach, an ILS approach that either has a very
    low decision height and decision height is when the pilot has to make a decision.
    If he sees the grounds, sees the runway or he goes around. So he's telling the
    tower that "We're on a cat three approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're five miles out." And the tower is actually giving the information. RVR
    is Runway Visual Range. So the tower is telling the pilot exactly what the range
    is, visual range on the runway, and he gives the touchdown, the midpoint and the
    rollout.

    a lot of skill from the pilot.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'CHAKRABARTI: We have affirmation from Austin Tower. One quick thing, just as
    an aside when FedEx identifies itself as FedEx 1432 heavy, the heavy indicates
    that it''s like, what, a 737?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'RINALDI: No, heavy. Yeah, I don''t know the type of aircraft. It''s probably,
    so heavy is the weight of the aircraft has a maximum, minimum takeoff weight of
    300,000 pounds or more. It''s usually a wide body, is probably Boeing 767 Boeing
    777\. I''m pretty sure that''s what FedEx uses for their wide bodies.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason you say heavy is because it leaves a wake much like a big boat
    in the water leaves a very big wake when it's going fast. Through the sky, heavy
    aircraft will leave a big wake and you want to make sure, they use that so that
    there is a warning of anyone that's going to fly behind heavy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    this first interaction. Austin Tower says 18L, one eight left. That''s an important
    designation.'

    eight right. So when he says, "You''re clear to land runway 18L."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He's telling the pilot, "You're lined up for the right runway. This is the runway
    you're going to land on." That's why the approach is being done. So it's really,
    it's a confirmation back and forth between the pilot and the controller.

    maybe they only have RVR Runway Visual Range readings on 18L, and that would be
    one of the main reasons you would use this. Because obviously the fog is very

    you''re not sitting with 30 departures that time in the morning.'
  prefs: []

    FedEx would land safely, on the CAT III approach. There's also some requirements

    they're doing such a precision approach as a CAT III approach.

    that pilot has a display in their cockpit, they could see, they have their own

    the runway. Southwest knows there''s a heavy three mile final. So just the way
    that controller would say it, it''s almost a key to tell Southwest, take this
    on a roll.'

    ever remember a pilot issuing a control instruction. Now, but the pilot, it wants
    to make this go around as safe as possible.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And he knows that Southwest took a while to spool up and start going, which
    is common first thing in the morning. This was the first flight in the morning.
    So they do some runaway checks, and they do a run up, what they would call with
    their engines, to make sure everything's functioning properly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then they start their departure roll. FedEx was getting very uncomfortable
    that Southwest is still on the runway. And that he's approaching the situation.
    He knows that if he goes around, he's going to go runway heading and climb, because
    that's probably the missed departure, or the go around route that he has to take.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So FedEx knows he's got to climb and go runway heading and he knows this is
    going to be a departure climbing run underneath them. That's why FedEx goes, "Avoid."
    Now I don't know the situation where the controller is at this point. It's important
    to give the controller some, maybe he's doing some collateral duties.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's first thing in the morning, setting up for the day. And he gave all the
    information, cleared Southwest, cleared FedEx, thinking everything's good. The
    important thing to know is there is no ground radar here. There's no ASDE-X or
    ASSC program that has separation logic that would alert the controller that you
    have a situation here, and you need to take control of the situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    But thank God he does at this time, because he's basically saved the day.

    example of what turned out to be a near miss. Everything, everyone landed and
    took off safely. We should say that, just before people get nervous, but it was
    a near miss. And the fact is that the number of near misses or the percentage

    the Southwest flight directly to abort, because FedEx was coming in for its landing.'

    take a turn in the air, right? Because he's still on the ground. And FedEx was
    right in trying to stop, although it's very unconventional. Like I said, I don't
    ever remember a pilot taking control of another flight. But FedEx was trying to
    stop that, knowing that they were both going to fly over the runway.

    close one and looking at the situation, not a lot of things scare me.
  prefs: []

    three miles out, and knowing they had to do it. It was going to be a little bit,

    200 feet. These things you all have to take into account, and you could hear in
    the controller's voice. Like yeah, not my best decision, certainly not my best
    day. And what you really, you know, as a controller in that situation, everything
    is report your role. And if he would have just said something like report your
    role, he would have saw that Southwest was going to get eaten up on the runway
    by FedEx.

    industry that given the catastrophes that can happen, if there are airplane collisions,
    we want that number of near misses to be zero, not growing.

    it seems as if things have been boiling under the surface for, what, 20, 30, maybe

    in the near term, the number of near misses probably reflects the fact that we
    have a post pandemic fairly dramatic increase in air travel. And at the same time,
    so air travel is going up at the same time, the traditional experience level of
    pilots and controllers is going down, because so many pilots retired or took a
    buyout during the pandemic, and because we have a shortage of controllers. So
    I think that is a near term issue. But I think the lack of technology at the Austin
    airport, the shortage of controllers. Those are chronic problems.'
