- en: The idea that a field could be responsible for the masses of particles *(specifically
    the masses of photon-like [“spin-one”] particles)* was proposed in several papers
    in 1964\. They included one by Peter Higgs, one by Robert Brout and Francois Englert,
    and one, slightly later but independent, by Gerald Guralnik, C. Richard Hagen,
    and Tom Kibble. This general idea was then incorporated into a specific theory
    of the real world’s particles; this was accomplished in 1967-1968 in two papers,
    one written by Steven Weinberg and one by Abdus Salam. The bare bones of this
    “Standard Model of Particle Physics” was finally confirmed experimentally in 2012.

    invented a couple of decades ago. It’s the kind of answer that serves if time
    is short and attention spans are limited; it is intended to sound plausible, even
    though the person delivering the “explanation” knows that it is wrong. In my recent
    book, I called this type of little lie, a compromise that physicists sometimes
    have to make between giving no answer and giving a correct but long answer, a
    “phib” — a physics fib. Phibs are usually harmless, as long as people don’t take
    them seriously. But the Higgs field’s phib is particularly problematic.

    violates several basic laws of physics**. These include foundational laws that
    have had a profound impact on human culture and are the first ones taught in any
    physics class. It also badly misrepresents [what a field is](https://profmattstrassler.com/2024/03/21/what-are-fields/)
    and what it can do. As a result, taking the phib seriously makes it literally
    impossible to understand the universe, or even daily human experience, in a coherent
    way. It’s a pedagogical step backwards, not forwards.

    version and Einstein’s updates to it. That principle, the oldest law of physics
    that has never been revised, says that **if your motion is steady and you are
    in a closed room, no experiment can tell you your speed, your direction of motion,
    or even whether you are in motion at all.** The phib directly contradicts this

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The phib violates Newton’s first law of motion — that **an object in motion
    not acted on by any force will remain in steady motion**. If the Higgs field slowed
    things down, it could only do so, according to this law, by exerting a force.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Newton, in predicting the motions of the planets, assumed that the only
    force acting on the planets was that of gravity. If the Higgs field exerted an
    additional force on the planets simply because they have mass (or because it was
    giving them mass), Newton’s methods for predicting planetary motions would have
    failed.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The phib also violates Newton’s second law of motion, by completely misrepresenting
    what mass is. It makes it seem as though mass makes motion difficult, or at least
    has something to do with inhibiting motion. But this is wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Newton’s second law states, **mass is something that inhibits *changes* in
    motion**. It does not inhibit motion, or cause things to slow down, or arise from
    things being slowed down. Mass is the property that makes it hard **both** to
    speed something up **and** to slow it down. It makes it harder to throw a lead
    ball compared to a plastic one, and it also makes the lead ball harder to catch
    bare-handed than a plastic one. It also makes it difficult to change something’s
    direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To say this another way, Newton’s second law ***F=ma*** says that to make a
    change in an object’s motion (an acceleration ***a***) requires a force (***F***);
    the larger the object’s mass (***m***), the larger the required force must be.
    Notice that it does not have anything to say about an object’s motion (its velocity
    ***v***).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To suggest that mass has to do with **motion**, and not with **change in motion**,
    is to suggest that Newton’s law should be ***F=mv*** — which, in fact, many pre-Newtonian
    physicists once believed. Let’s not let a phib throw us back to the misguided
    science of the Middle Ages!

    causing all of them to slow down. After all, if there were a universal “soup”
    found everywhere, then every object would encounter it. If it were true that the
    Higgs field acted on all objects in the same way — “universally”, similar to gravity,
    which pulls on **all** objects — then every object in our world would get its
    mass from the Higgs field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    particles***. More complex particles such as protons and neutrons — and therefore
    the atoms, molecules, humans and planets that contain them — get most of their
    mass in another way. The phib, therefore, can’t be right about how the Higgs field
    does its job.

    talks at the physics departments at Vanderbilt and Irvine.) Although I tried delivering
    it to non-experts in an hour-long talk, I found that it just doesn’t fit. But
    it did fit quite well in a course for non-experts, in which I had several hours
