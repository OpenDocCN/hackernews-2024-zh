When a [7.4-magnitude earthquake rocked Taiwan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/04/taiwan-earthquake-hualien-update/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) on Wednesday, people inside the island’s tallest skyscraper, Taipei 101, were protected by a large yellow pendulum at the building’s center that helped absorb the shock.

Known as a “tuned mass damper,” the 730-ton steel sphere is suspended between several floors at the top of the building, where it can be viewed by the [public](https://www.taipei-101.com.tw/en/observatory/feature/scenery). The observatory is a popular tourist attraction in the capital city.
