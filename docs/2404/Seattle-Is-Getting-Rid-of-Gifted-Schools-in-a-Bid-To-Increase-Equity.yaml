- en: In 2021, Seattle Public Schools (SPS) moved to phase out its "highly capable
    cohort schools." The district had three elementary schools, five middle schools,
    and three high schools devoted to teaching students at an accelerated pace. The
    district plans to finish phasing out the specialized schools by the 2027–28 school
    year. The reasons behind the change are rooted in the disproportionate number
    of white and Asian students in the program.
