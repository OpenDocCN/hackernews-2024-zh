    perhaps we would care to. As they continue to widely circulate, however, it's
    beneficial for psychologists to study why people believe in them, what traits
    encourage such beliefs, and what we can do to curb their spread.

  zh: 过去几年来，我们都听说过阴谋论比我们愿意的可能要多。然而，随着它们继续广泛传播，对于心理学家来说，研究人们为何相信它们、什么特质促使这种信仰以及我们可以做些什么来遏制它们的传播是有益的。

- en: Adopting a longitudinal design, the team recruited 498 adult participants living
    in Australia and New Zealand. The study took place from March to September 2021,
    a period in which Covid-19 vaccinations were being rolled out, and many areas
    in Australia and New Zealand were still operating under lockdown conditions —
    according to [existing theories](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381),
    facing such widespread societal threat and uncertainty plausibly made this a time

  zh: 采用纵向设计，团队招募了生活在澳大利亚和新西兰的498名成年参与者。该研究从2021年3月到9月进行，这段时间正值新冠疫苗接种期间，澳大利亚和新西兰许多地区仍在实施封锁措施
    —— 根据[现有理论](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381)，面对如此广泛的社会威胁和不确定性，这可能是阴谋信仰增长的时机。
- en: Throughout these six months, participants completed a survey on seven occasions,
    responding to questions focused on widespread conspiracies, such as SARS-CoV-2
    being a bioweapon, 9/11 being an inside job, condensation from planes supposedly
    being harmful 'chemtrails', and vaccinations being a way to implant a chip in
    people's bodies. After reading the theories, participants indicated how much they
    agreed with each of them, allowing the team to create a general conspiracy belief
    score out of five for each participant.

  zh: 在这六个月中，参与者共完成了七次调查，回答了针对广泛阴谋论的问题，例如SARS-CoV-2是否是生物武器、911事件是否是内部工作、飞机冷凝物是否是有害的“化学尾迹”，以及疫苗是否是植入人体芯片的方式。在阅读这些理论后，参与者表明他们对每个理论的认同程度，使团队能够为每位参与者创建一个总体阴谋信仰得分。
- en: Analyses revealed that there was very little change in participants' belief
    in conspiracy theories during the study. While some people did change their minds
    about conspiracy theories (both adopting and abandoning them) there was far less
    variance in individuals' conspiracy beliefs than there was as a group overall.
    Across the six months, the average change in score was small, with mean changes
    of 0.16 points, or 3.2% — representing very marginal changes in belief.

  zh: 分析显示，在研究期间，参与者对阴谋论的信仰几乎没有变化。尽管一些人改变了对阴谋论的看法（既采纳又放弃），但个体的阴谋信仰变化远远小于整体群体的变化。在六个月的时间里，平均分数变化很小，平均变化为0.16分，或3.2%
    —— 表示信仰上的极微小变化。
- en: 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering the moment at which this research was conducted,
    there was just one conspiracy theory that bucked this trend: the belief that SARS-CoV-2
    was a biological weapon created by China, which increased slightly between May
    and June 2021\. These shifts, however, were a marginal 3.8% increase, which the
    team argues is "difficult to reconcile" with explanatory theories such as [the
    Existential Threat Model](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381),
    which suggests that distressing societal events lead people to embrace conspiracy
    theories. With the Covid pandemic being one of the most distressing global events
    in recent memory, such models might expect a greater increase.'

  zh: 或许并不令人意外的是，考虑到这项研究进行的时机，有一种阴谋理论与这一趋势背道而驰：认为SARS-CoV-2是中国制造的生物武器的信念，在2021年5月至6月之间略有增加。然而，这些变化仅仅是3.8%的轻微增长，研究团队认为这与诸如[存在威胁模型](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381)等解释理论难以协调。存在威胁模型认为，社会上的令人不安事件会促使人们接受阴谋理论。考虑到Covid-19大流行是近年来最令人不安的全球事件之一，这样的模型可能预期会有更大的增长。
- en: While these findings are somewhat reassuring, in that they suggest people's
    belief in conspiracy theories is relatively stable, even in the face of widespread
    societal threat, it's possible that the beliefs of this highly educated, young,
    and liberal sample might not paint the full picture. Findings from this demographic
    won't easily generalise to those with right-wing political beliefs — and with
    those at the extremes often cited as more readily embracing of conspiracy theories,
    we arguably need more studies that pursue participants who fall into this group.
    Conservative participants in this study (just 9% of the total cohort) showed higher
    levels of conspiracy belief, which suggests cause for a replication effort with
    a more diverse sample.

  zh: 虽然这些发现在某种程度上令人 gerdanxian定心，因为它们表明人们对阴谋理论的信仰在广泛的社会威胁面前相对稳定，但是有可能这些高学历、年轻和自由样本的信仰并不能完全描绘全貌。来自这一人群的发现不容易推广到那些持右翼政治信仰的人士
    —— 而那些极端人士往往更容易接受阴谋理论，因此我们可以说需要更多研究来追踪这些群体的参与者。研究中的保守派参与者（仅占总队伍的9%）显示出更高水平的阴谋信仰，这表明有必要通过更多样本的复制研究来验证结果。
- en: It's also important to note that most participants disagreed with the theories
    they were shown — the most popular overall was that pharmaceutical companies had
    suppressed a cure for cancer, which still only sat at an average of 2.23 out of
    5 on the scale of belief. The fact that these participants had a generally low
    belief in conspiracies, therefore, may also act as a limitation, or at least a
    point for future research to address.

  zh: 还需注意，大多数参与者不认同他们所看到的理论 —— 全球最受欢迎的是制药公司抑制癌症治愈方法的理论，但平均仅在5分制信仰度量中得到2.23分。因此，这些参与者对阴谋理论的整体低信仰度可能也作为一种局限，或者至少是未来研究需要解决的问题。
- en: Finally, most of the conspiracies looked at in the study were popularised much
    earlier than the study's start date. Future research could look at how those prone
    to conspiracy beliefs come to embrace new theories as they emerge and take shape,
    which could hopefully offer further insights on how to protect against fringe
    beliefs.
