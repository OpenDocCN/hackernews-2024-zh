- en: Over the last few years, we've all heard more about conspiracy theories than
    perhaps we would care to. As they continue to widely circulate, however, it's
    beneficial for psychologists to study why people believe in them, what traits
    encourage such beliefs, and what we can do to curb their spread.

    focused on how a person's belief in conspiracy theories evolves over time.

    study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-51653-z) took a closer look at just
    how much, if at all, everyday people's beliefs in conspiracies change over a specific
    six month span during which developing them may have been particularly tempting.

    in Australia and New Zealand. The study took place from March to September 2021,
    a period in which Covid-19 vaccinations were being rolled out, and many areas
    in Australia and New Zealand were still operating under lockdown conditions —
    according to [existing theories](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381),
    facing such widespread societal threat and uncertainty plausibly made this a time
    ripe for [growth in conspiracy belief.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11196-022-09910-9)

    responding to questions focused on widespread conspiracies, such as SARS-CoV-2
    being a bioweapon, 9/11 being an inside job, condensation from planes supposedly
    being harmful 'chemtrails', and vaccinations being a way to implant a chip in
    people's bodies. After reading the theories, participants indicated how much they
    agreed with each of them, allowing the team to create a general conspiracy belief
    score out of five for each participant.

- en: Analyses revealed that there was very little change in participants' belief
    in conspiracy theories during the study. While some people did change their minds
    about conspiracy theories (both adopting and abandoning them) there was far less
    variance in individuals' conspiracy beliefs than there was as a group overall.
    Across the six months, the average change in score was small, with mean changes
    of 0.16 points, or 3.2% — representing very marginal changes in belief.

    there was just one conspiracy theory that bucked this trend: the belief that SARS-CoV-2
    was a biological weapon created by China, which increased slightly between May
    and June 2021\. These shifts, however, were a marginal 3.8% increase, which the
    team argues is "difficult to reconcile" with explanatory theories such as [the
    Existential Threat Model](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381),
    which suggests that distressing societal events lead people to embrace conspiracy
    theories. With the Covid pandemic being one of the most distressing global events
    in recent memory, such models might expect a greater increase.'

  zh: 或许并不令人意外的是，考虑到这项研究进行的时机，有一种阴谋理论与这一趋势背道而驰：认为SARS-CoV-2是中国制造的生物武器的信念，在2021年5月至6月之间略有增加。然而，这些变化仅仅是3.8%的轻微增长，研究团队认为这与诸如[存在威胁模型](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/10.1027/1016-9040/a000381)等解释理论难以协调。存在威胁模型认为，社会上的令人不安事件会促使人们接受阴谋理论。考虑到Covid-19大流行是近年来最令人不安的全球事件之一，这样的模型可能预期会有更大的增长。
- en: While these findings are somewhat reassuring, in that they suggest people's
    belief in conspiracy theories is relatively stable, even in the face of widespread
    societal threat, it's possible that the beliefs of this highly educated, young,
    and liberal sample might not paint the full picture. Findings from this demographic
    won't easily generalise to those with right-wing political beliefs — and with
    those at the extremes often cited as more readily embracing of conspiracy theories,
    we arguably need more studies that pursue participants who fall into this group.
    Conservative participants in this study (just 9% of the total cohort) showed higher
    levels of conspiracy belief, which suggests cause for a replication effort with
    a more diverse sample.

  zh: 虽然这些发现在某种程度上令人 gerdanxian定心，因为它们表明人们对阴谋理论的信仰在广泛的社会威胁面前相对稳定，但是有可能这些高学历、年轻和自由样本的信仰并不能完全描绘全貌。来自这一人群的发现不容易推广到那些持右翼政治信仰的人士
    —— 而那些极端人士往往更容易接受阴谋理论，因此我们可以说需要更多研究来追踪这些群体的参与者。研究中的保守派参与者（仅占总队伍的9%）显示出更高水平的阴谋信仰，这表明有必要通过更多样本的复制研究来验证结果。
- en: It's also important to note that most participants disagreed with the theories
    they were shown — the most popular overall was that pharmaceutical companies had
    suppressed a cure for cancer, which still only sat at an average of 2.23 out of
    5 on the scale of belief. The fact that these participants had a generally low
    belief in conspiracies, therefore, may also act as a limitation, or at least a
    point for future research to address.

  zh: 还需注意，大多数参与者不认同他们所看到的理论 —— 全球最受欢迎的是制药公司抑制癌症治愈方法的理论，但平均仅在5分制信仰度量中得到2.23分。因此，这些参与者对阴谋理论的整体低信仰度可能也作为一种局限，或者至少是未来研究需要解决的问题。
- en: Finally, most of the conspiracies looked at in the study were popularised much
    earlier than the study's start date. Future research could look at how those prone
    to conspiracy beliefs come to embrace new theories as they emerge and take shape,
    which could hopefully offer further insights on how to protect against fringe
    beliefs.

  zh: 最后，研究中所考察的大多数阴谋理论要比研究开始日期早得多。未来的研究可以探讨那些易信阴谋理论的人是如何在新理论出现和形成过程中接受并采纳这些理论的，这或许能够进一步洞察如何防范边缘信念。
