- en: On Tuesday, Axon, the $22 billion police contractor best known for manufacturing
    the Taser electric weapon, launched a new tool called Draft One that it says can
    transcribe audio from body cameras and automatically turn it into a police report.
    Cops can then review the document to ensure accuracy, Axon CEO Rick Smith told
    *Forbes*. Axon claims one early tester of the tool, Fort Collins Colorado Police
    Department, has seen an 82% decrease in time spent writing reports. “If an officer
    spends half their day reporting, and we can cut that in half, we have an opportunity
    to potentially free up 25% of an officer's time to be back out policing,” Smith
    said.

    are concerned that relying on AI could put people at risk by depending on language
    models that are known to “hallucinate,” or make things up, as well as display
    racial bias, either blatantly or unconsciously.

    director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “Police, who aren't specialists
    in AI, and aren’t going to be specialists in recognizing the problems with AI,
    are going to use these systems to generate language that could affect millions
    of people in their involvement with the criminal justice system. What could go
    wrong?”

    incidents as serious as a police shooting, where vital information could be missed.
    “An officer-involved shooting is likely a scenario where it would not be used,
    and I'd probably advise people against it, just because there's so much complexity,
    the stakes are so high.” He said some early customers are only using Draft One
    for misdemeanours, though others are writing up “more significant incidents,”
    including use-of-force cases. Axon, however, won’t have control over how individual
    police departments use the tools.

    AI product manager Noah Spitzer-Williams told *Forbes* that to counter racial
    or other biases, the company has configured its AI, based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo
    model, so it sticks to the facts of what’s being recorded. “The simplest way to
    think about it is that we have turned off the creativity,” he said. “That dramatically
    reduces the number of hallucinations and mistakes… Everything that it's produced
    is just based on that transcript and that transcript alone.”

    body cam transcripts, and in each scenario only changed the suspect’s race — for
    example swapping out the word “white” for “Black” or “Latino” — and ran it through
    the AI model. In testing, the generated police reports showed no “statistically
    significant differences across races,” for hundreds of samples, Spitzer-Williams
    said.

    In the video, an officer is talking to a bystander named Marcus at a playground,
    who is describing a suspect harassing a family. The man describes the suspect
    as wearing a green jacket, and says he’s about “my height.” The software then
    generates a short 5-paragraph narrative describing the situation. “Marcus stated
    that the incident occurred roughly 20 minutes prior to our conversation and that
    the suspect was last seen hiding behind the slide at the park,” reads part of
    the generated text. The AI model also flagged areas where the officer needed to
    add more context to the report, such as Marcus’ height for reference.

    about Axon’s company culture. Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/axon-taser-exposures/
    "https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/axon-taser-exposures/") some
    staff felt pressured to be tasered in front of other employees and get corporate
    tattoos as a way of proving their commitment to the company. “The things they
    were criticizing us for are generally things we are proud of,” Smith said of the
    culture criticisms. “Our recruiting numbers went up when they ran those recent
    stories.”
