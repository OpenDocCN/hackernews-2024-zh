- en: On Tuesday, Axon, the $22 billion police contractor best known for manufacturing
    the Taser electric weapon, launched a new tool called Draft One that it says can
    transcribe audio from body cameras and automatically turn it into a police report.
    Cops can then review the document to ensure accuracy, Axon CEO Rick Smith told
    *Forbes*. Axon claims one early tester of the tool, Fort Collins Colorado Police
    Department, has seen an 82% decrease in time spent writing reports. “If an officer
    spends half their day reporting, and we can cut that in half, we have an opportunity
    to potentially free up 25% of an officer's time to be back out policing,” Smith
    said.

    incidents as serious as a police shooting, where vital information could be missed.
    “An officer-involved shooting is likely a scenario where it would not be used,
    and I'd probably advise people against it, just because there's so much complexity,
    the stakes are so high.” He said some early customers are only using Draft One
    for misdemeanours, though others are writing up “more significant incidents,”
    including use-of-force cases. Axon, however, won’t have control over how individual
    police departments use the tools.

  zh: Smith表示，Axon建议警方不要使用AI来为像警方枪击这样严重的事件撰写报告，因为可能会漏掉重要信息。“涉警方的枪击很可能是不会使用的场景，并且我可能会劝告人们不要使用，只是因为这么复杂，风险如此之大。”
    他说，一些早期客户只在轻罪案件中使用Draft One，而其他人则在撰写“更重大的事件”，包括使用武力的案例。然而，Axon并不会控制个别警察局如何使用这些工具。

    AI product manager Noah Spitzer-Williams told *Forbes* that to counter racial
    or other biases, the company has configured its AI, based on OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo
    model, so it sticks to the facts of what’s being recorded. “The simplest way to
    think about it is that we have turned off the creativity,” he said. “That dramatically
    reduces the number of hallucinations and mistakes… Everything that it's produced
    is just based on that transcript and that transcript alone.”

  zh: Axon高级首席AI产品经理Noah Spitzer-Williams告诉《福布斯》说，为了抵消种族或其他偏见，公司已经配置了其AI，基于OpenAI的GPT-4
    Turbo模型，使其坚持录制的事实。“最简单的想法是我们已经关闭了创造性，”他说。“这大大减少了产生幻觉和错误的数量……它所产生的一切都仅仅基于那个记录和仅仅那个记录。”
- en: Spitzer-Williams added that Axon also ran a test where the company took existing
    body cam transcripts, and in each scenario only changed the suspect’s race — for
    example swapping out the word “white” for “Black” or “Latino” — and ran it through
    the AI model. In testing, the generated police reports showed no “statistically
    significant differences across races,” for hundreds of samples, Spitzer-Williams
    said.

  zh: Spitzer-Williams补充说，Axon还进行了一项测试，公司拿现有的警用摄像头转录并在每种情况下只改变了嫌疑人的种族——例如，将“白人”换成了“黑人”或“拉丁裔”——并将其输入AI模型进行测试。在测试中，生成的警用报告显示出针对数百个样本，“种族之间没有‘统计学上显著的差异’”，Spitzer-Williams说。
- en: In demos shown to *Forbes*, Spitzer-Williams uploaded sample body cam footage.
    In the video, an officer is talking to a bystander named Marcus at a playground,
    who is describing a suspect harassing a family. The man describes the suspect
    as wearing a green jacket, and says he’s about “my height.” The software then
    generates a short 5-paragraph narrative describing the situation. “Marcus stated
    that the incident occurred roughly 20 minutes prior to our conversation and that
    the suspect was last seen hiding behind the slide at the park,” reads part of
    the generated text. The AI model also flagged areas where the officer needed to
    add more context to the report, such as Marcus’ height for reference.

    AI模型还标记了警官需要在报告中增加更多背景信息的地方，比如马库斯的身高作为参考。
