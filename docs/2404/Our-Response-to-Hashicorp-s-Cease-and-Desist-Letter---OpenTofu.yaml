- en: On April 3rd, we received a Cease and Desist letter from HashiCorp regarding
    our implementation of the "removed" block in OpenTofu, claiming copyright infringement
    on the part of one of our core developers. We were also made aware of an article
    posted that same day with the same accusations. We have investigated these claims
    and are publishing the C&D letter, our response and the source code origin document
    resulting from our investigation.

    These claims are **completely unsubstantiated**.

    under the MPL-2.0 license. HashiCorp seems to have copied the same code itself
    when they implemented their version of this feature. All of this is easily visible
    in our detailed SCO analysis, as well as their own comments which indicate this.

    OpenTofu 1.7, including state encryption, “for_each” implementation for “import”
    blocks, as well as the all-new **provider-defined functions** supported by the
    recently released provider plugin protocol.

    we are eager to gather feedback from the community.
