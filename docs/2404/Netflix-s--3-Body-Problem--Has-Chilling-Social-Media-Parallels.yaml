- en: When Cixin Liu's science fiction novel, *The Three-Body Problem*, debuted in
    English translation for American readers in 2014, it was clear that it was a comment
    on the perils of Chinese authoritarianism. The books have now been adapted into
    a series for Netflix; seen today, the story looks as much like a comment on social
    media. There's a reason that the first shades so quickly into the second.

  zh: 当刘慈欣的科幻小说《三体问题》于2014年首次以英文翻译形式面向美国读者问世时，很明显，它是对中国专制主义危害的评论。这些书现在已被改编为Netflix系列；从今天的视角来看，这个故事看起来更像是对社交媒体的评论。第一部迅速过渡到第二部，这是有原因的。
- en: The novel, initially published in 2008, begins with a harrowing sequence from
    China's Cultural Revolution in which a scientist is beaten and ultimately killed
    as part of a "struggle session," a public self-incrimination in front of an angry
    mob. The session was led by revolutionary youth who insisted the scientist had
    committed a crime against the people by stating basic facts about the fundamental
    nature of the universe that undermined the ideology of Chinese Communism. But
    the scientist does not recant. He cannot bring himself to say that which he knows
    to be simply untrue.

  zh: 这部小说最初于2008年出版，以中国文化大革命的一个惊心动魄的序列开始，在这个序列中，一位科学家在"批斗会"中被殴打并最终被杀，批斗会是一种公开的自我指控，面对一群愤怒的民众。这场批斗会由革命青年领导，他们坚持认为科学家通过陈述宇宙基本事实，从而颠覆了中国共产主义的意识形态，犯下了反人民的罪行。但这位科学家没有改变立场。他无法说出他知道的纯属不实之事。
- en: That sequence frames the novel and the rest of Liu's trilogy. It's a story about
    authoritarian overreach, the danger of mob thinking, the endurance of science
    and fact even in the face of political pressure, and [the hidden power of the
    private mind](https://reason.com/2016/12/18/the-hidden-mind/). Yet in a reminder
    of the Chinese government's persistent censorial power, Liu [apparently](https://twitter.com/TrungTPhan/status/1771606190809907318)
    had to move it to later in the novel in order to appease Communist Party overseers.
    He now recommends that readers seek out the English translation.

- en: The Netflix adaptation, *3 Body Problem*, also begins with this sequence. But
    the struggle session feels more familiar now, thanks to social media. Since 2014,
    almost anyone who has followed online arguments has witnessed a social media struggle
    session, or [dozens of them](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/scholars-under-fire-database-guide),
    in which some notable person, often an intellectual or media figure, is hit with
    politicized demands to recant their own inconvenient ideas, beliefs, and even,
    at times, inarguably true facts—or face consequences from an online mob. These
    online struggle sessions don't result in violent death and they are (usually)
    not state-sponsored, but they do result in social punishments, including and especially
    the loss of work. The common name for these episodes isn't struggle sessions;
    it's cancellations. They are not precisely comparable phenomena, but they share
    methods and an overarching ethos.

  zh: Netflix的改编剧集《三体问题》同样以这个序列开始。但由于社交媒体的存在，这场批斗会现在更为熟悉。自2014年以来，几乎每个关注在线争论的人都见证了社交媒体上的批斗会，或[其中的数十次](https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/scholars-under-fire-database-guide)，其中一些著名人物，通常是知识分子或媒体人士，受到政治化要求，要求他们放弃他们的不便观点、信仰，甚至有时无可争议的真实事实，否则将面临来自在线群体的后果。这些在线批斗会不会导致暴力死亡，它们（通常）不是国家支持的，但它们确实导致社会惩罚，尤其是失去工作。这些事件的通用名词不是批斗会，而是“取消”。它们并不完全可比较，但它们分享了方法和总体的道德观念。
- en: Both the books and the series track humanity's first contact with an alien race
    that is slowly making its way toward Earth. These aliens, called Trisolarans in
    the books and San Ti in the series, do not have the capacity for private, individual
    thoughts, as every passing idea is "projected" for all to see. As the story proceeds,
    the aliens use their superior technology to inflict a twisted version of this
    on the human race, sending a "sophon" to spy on the Earth. A sophon is a proton-sized
    computer that is capable of surveiling any and all human communications, from
    private conversations to electronic messages to records stored in offline data
    banks. It transforms the entire planet into a terrifying panopticon. Effectively,
    it allows Earth's alien antagonists to see and hear *everything*.

- en: 'As with the opening sequence, the parallels with China''s totalitarian surveillance
    regime are clear: Chinese citizens are always being watched, always being spied
    upon, creating a climate of fear and distrust and paranoia, and repressing the
    sort of free back and forth that is necessary to both scientific progress and
    cultural cohesion. Indeed, the aliens explicitly intend to slow or block scientific
    discovery. And a fractured and distrustful humanity that cannot negotiate its
    differences and disputes makes for an easier enemy to conquer.'

    the terrified public. Liu imagined this scenario more than a decade before COVID-19,
    but in the aftermath of the pandemic, in which the initial wave of draconian restrictions
    were sometimes as much of a product of public demand as top-down control, it's
    easy to see how this sort of panicked overreaction could happen.

- en: But in Liu's telling, humanity survives not through top-down systems of control
    but through individual efforts, carried out in private. In both the show and the
    books, humanity's response to the aliens is led by a group of people known as
    Wallfacers who are empowered and granted vast resources to carry out whatever
    plans they desire, with no questions asked. Their plans are never to be made public,
    never to be stated clearly or communicated for the sophons to see.

- en: 'Indeed, in Liu''s books, one Wallfacer, rather than attempt to build weapons
    or command an army against the invaders, simply spends his time imagining a beautiful,
    gentle, secret paradise with an idealized version of someone he hoped to love.
    It''s a beautiful, quiet, placid, peaceful space for rest, for joy, for the comfort
    of another soul. There''s a lesson here for the fight against authoritarianism
