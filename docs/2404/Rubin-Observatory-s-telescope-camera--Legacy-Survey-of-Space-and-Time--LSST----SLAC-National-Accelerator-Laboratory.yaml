- en: The camera also contains a carousel that holds five on-board filters. Each of
    the filters can be individually swapped out in under two minutes and up to four
    times a night with the double-rail auto changer. The system also integrates with
    a manual load-lock changer to allow for a swap-out of a sixth filter.

- en: The optimized wavelength range for the LSST Camera is 320–1050 nm (near ultraviolet
    to near infrared). This range is divided into six spectral bands labeled [u-g-r-i-z-y](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/media/lsst-ugrizyjpeg),
    each associated with one of the filters. For example, an infrared, or “i” filter
    might be used to observe sources obscured by dust, since infrared wavelengths
    can pass through the dust.
