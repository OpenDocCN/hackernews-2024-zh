- en: In the nine decades since humans first produced fusion reactions, only a few
    fusion technologies have demonstrated the ability to make a thermal fusion plasma
    with electron temperatures hotter than 10 million degrees Celsius, roughly the
    temperature of the core of the sun. Zap Energy’s unique approach, known as a [sheared-flow-stabilized
    Z pinch](https://www.zapenergy.com/how-it-works), has now joined those rarefied
    ranks, far exceeding this plasma temperature milestone in a device that is a fraction
    of the scale of its competitors.

    published this month in *Physical Review Letters*, details measurements made on
    Zap Energy’s Fusion Z-pinch Experiment (FuZE) of 1-3 keV plasma electron temperatures
    — roughly the equivalent of 11 to 37 million degrees Celsius (20 to 66 million
    degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the electrons’ ability to rapidly cool a plasma, this
    feat is a key hurdle for fusion systems and FuZE is the simplest, smallest and
    lowest cost device to have achieved it. Zap’s technology offers the potential
    for a much shorter and more practical path to a commercial product capable of
    producing abundant, on-demand, carbon-free energy to the globe.

    modest scale by traditional fusion standards,” describes Ben Levitt, VP of R&D
    at Zap. “We’ve still got a lot of work ahead of us, but our performance to date
    has advanced to a point that we can now stand shoulder to shoulder with some of
    the world’s pre-eminent fusion devices, but with great efficiency, and at a fraction
    of the complexity and cost.”

    U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E).
    The device moved to Zap Energy’s dedicated R&D facilities in 2020, soon after
    the company was founded. The results in this paper were collected in 2022 in a
    collaboration funded by ARPA-E with researchers from Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratory (LLNL) and University of California, San Diego (UCSD), who spearheaded
    the development of the measurement system used for these results.

    have reached 1-keV electron temperature,” notes Scott Hsu, Lead Fusion Coordinator
    at the DOE and former ARPA-E Program Director. “What this team has achieved here
    is remarkable and reinforces ARPA-E’s efforts to accelerate the development of
    commercial fusion energy.”

- en: The first step to create the conditions for fusion is to generate a plasma –
    the energetic “fourth state of matter” where nuclei and electrons aren’t bound
    together into atoms but flow freely in a sub-atomic soup. Compressing and heating
    a plasma made of two forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium causes their
    nuclei to collide and fuse. When they do, fusion reactions give off roughly 10
    million times more energy per ounce than burning the same amount of coal.

    small quantities. However, the great challenge is to create more output fusion
    energy from those reactions than the input energy required to initiate them.

    as a [Z pinch](https://www.zapenergy.com/blog/history-of-the-z-pinch), where large
    electric currents are channeled through a thin filament of plasma. The conducting
    plasma generates its own electromagnetic fields, which both heats and compresses
    it. While Z-pinch fusion has been experimented with since the 1950’s, the approach
    has largely been stymied by how short-lived its plasmas are, a problem Zap has
    solved by applying a dynamic flow through the plasma, a process called [sheared-flow
    stabilization](https://www.zapenergy.com/blog/a-moving-stream-zap-energys-novel-approach-to-stabilizing-fusion).

    “As we climb to higher and higher plasma currents, we optimize the sweet spot
    where the temperature, density and lifetime of the Z pinch align to form a stable,
    high-performance fusing plasma.”

- en: Fusion researchers measure plasma temperatures in units of electron-volts and
    can measure the temperature of the plasma’s ions (nuclei) and electrons separately.
    Since the ions are more than a thousand-fold heavier than the electrons, the two
    components of the plasma can heat and cool at different rates. Since the ions
    are what ultimately need to be heated to fusion temperatures, plasma physicists
    often worry about situations where cold electrons limit ion heating, like ice
    cubes in a hot soup. The electrons in the FuZE plasma, however, were shown to
    be as hot as the ions, indicating that the plasma is in a healthy thermal equilibrium.

    neutron production peak simultaneously. As neutrons are a primary product of the
    fusing ions, these observations support the idea of a fusing plasma in thermal
    equilibrium.

    overall picture of a fusion plasma with room to scale toward energy gain,” says
    Uri Shumlak, co-founder and Chief Scientist at Zap Energy. “Working at higher
    currents we’re still seeing sheared flow extending the Z-pinch lifetimes long
    enough to produce very high temperatures and the associated neutron yields we’d
    predict from modeling.”

    from LLNL and UCSD skilled in a plasma measurement technique called Thomson scattering.
    To perform Thomson scattering, scientists use a very bright, very fast laser to
    fire a pulse of green light into the plasma, which scatters off of the electrons
    and provides information about their temperature and density.

    Zap now routinely gathers Thomson scattering data on FuZE-Q, its latest-generation
    device.

    majority of fusion research in recent decades, Zap’s technology does not require
    expensive and complex superconducting magnets or powerful lasers. “Zap tech is
    orders of magnitude less expensive and quicker to build than other devices, allowing
    us to iterate rapidly and produce the cheapest thermal fusion neutrons out there.
    Compelling innovation economics are vital to launching a commercial fusion product
    on a timescale that matters,” said Benj Conway, CEO and co-founder of Zap.

    its next-generation device FuZE-Q](https://www.zapenergy.com/news/first-plasmas-fuzeq-series-c).
    While early results from FuZE-Q are still forthcoming, the device has a power
    bank with ten times the stored energy as FuZE and capacity to scale to much higher
    temperatures and densities. Meanwhile, parallel development of power plant systems
    is also underway.

    status quo, so definitively crossing this high electron temperature mark and seeing

    solve them.”
