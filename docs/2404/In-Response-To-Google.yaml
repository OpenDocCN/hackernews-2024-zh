    The March 2019 core update was designed to improve the quality of our search results,
    as all core updates are designed to do. It is incorrect to say it rolled back
    our quality or our anti-spam protections, which we''ve developed over many years

    quote Google, as quoted by Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/google-on-the-march-2019-core-update-this-is-not-the-biggest-update-weve-released-314099?ref=wheresyoured.at),
    Google’s March 2019 was “not the biggest update [Google has] released,” and in
    that article, Schwartz even suggests that this update might have been a case where
    Google “reverses the previous core updates,” which resulted in a Google spokesperson
    saying that it was“constantly improving our algorithms and build forward to improve,”
    which is most assuredly not a denial. In the event it is a denial, Google should
    be clear about it.

    who on March 14 2019 referred to the March 2019 core update as “behaving like
    a rollback of previous updates.” Monti also quoted Brett Tabke of WebMasterWorld,
    who said, and I quote, “I think we may be seeing a rollback of a few of the last
    updates.” Monti also published another article called “[Data Confirms Why Google
    March 2019 Update Feels Like a Rollback](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-update-rollback/298647/?ref=wheresyoured.at)”
    on March 16, 2019, which referred to [an indepth report from SEO tool company
    Sistrix](https://www.sistrix.com/blog/the-first-core-algorithm-update-of-the-year-is-rolling/?ref=wheresyoured.at)
    that found that “75% of winners were previous losers…that means that 75% of the

    in previous updates of 2018.”

    these changes as anything other than a rollback, especially when these sites were

    the opaque and mercurial updates made to Google Search.

    Jerry Dischler asks Anil Sabharwal, then the Vice President and General Manager
    of Chrome on an email including Prabhakar Raghavan, Nick Fox, Ben Gomes, and several
    other Googlers, whether it was “worth reconsidering a rollback,” and that he didn’t
    want the message to be “we’re doing this thing because the Ads team needs revenue”
    in a sentence referring to the ads team asking the Search and Chrome teams to
    do stuff to increase revenue.

    revenue loss that they saw in Q3” of 2018.
