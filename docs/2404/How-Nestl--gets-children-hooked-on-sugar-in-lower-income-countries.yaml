- en: Our investigation shows that Nestlé uses aggressive marketing methods to promote
    Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the WHO’s International
    Code which [prohibits](https://www.who.int/tools/elena/interventions/regulation-breast-milk-substitutes)
    the commercial promotion of such products. The Code, originally adopted in 1981
    in the wake of the “baby killers” [scandal,](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards)
    and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans all promotion of infant
    formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban also [applies](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1)
    to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac, do not meet
    nutrition guidelines and contain “high levels of sugar”.

    as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.” “Where local
    law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code, we adhere to
    our strict Policy,” Nestlé adds.

    contain loopholes and implementation is generally [weak](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2023/06/20/default-calendar/global-congress-on-implementation-of-the-international-code-of-marketing-of-breast-milk-substitutes)
    in low- and middle-income countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food
    industry and exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestlé policy neither applies
    to formulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although
    these are all covered by the Code.

    for children’s development, although they contain added sugar and carry many risks
    for children’s health and development. “Often manufacturers’ health claims are
    not supported by the science,” says Rollins, in response to reading our report.
    “If you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want to claim that it improves
    brain development in babies, or improve growth in babies, you would have to pass
    very high standards of evidence,” he explains. “But because it’s a food, you don’t
    have to pass those standards.”

    in a recent report that warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise
    the progress made in infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers
    as to the real content of these foods and should not be made, according to the
    UN agency. Yet Nestlé has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy.
