Traditionally, comics are drawn by hand by multiple artists. Shortbread Studio speeds up the process 20x, allowing anyone to bring a story idea to a high quality comic series in minutes.

On the Shortbread App, creators publish and sell their comic series. We specialize in guilty-pleasure romance stories serving a mature audience. Indulge in visually stunning 50 Shades of Grey comics at your fingertips.
