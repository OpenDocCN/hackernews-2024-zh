    provides a JavaScript interface to the [WebSocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455),
    which makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between
    the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server
    and receive event-driven responses without polling the server for a reply.

- en: The [Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) allows
    JavaScript to programmatically access streams of data chunks received over the
    network and process them as desired. An important concept in the context of streams
    is [backpressure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Streams_API/Concepts#Backpressure).
    This is the process by which a single stream or a pipe chain regulates the speed
    of reading or writing. When the stream itself or a stream later in the pipe chain
    is still busy and isn't yet ready to accept more chunks, it sends a signal backwards
    through the chain to slow delivery as appropriate.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's assume you had an application that needs to perform heavy data crunching
    operations whenever a new message is received. You would probably set up the flow
    similar to the code below, and since you `await` the result of the `process()`
    call, you should be good, right?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Wrong! The problem with the current WebSocket API is that there is no way to
    apply backpressure. When messages arrive faster than the `process()` method can
    handle them, the render process will either fill up memory by buffering those
    messages, become unresponsive due to 100% CPU usage, or both.

    [`WebSocket.bufferedAmount`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/bufferedAmount)

    the number of bytes of data that have been queued using calls to [`WebSocket.send()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send),
    but not yet transmitted to the network. This value resets to zero once all queued
    data has been sent, but if you keep calling `WebSocket.send()`, it will continue
    to climb.

- en: The WebSocketStream API is promise-based, which makes dealing with it feel natural
    in a modern JavaScript world. You start by constructing a new `WebSocketStream`
    and passing it the URL of the WebSocket server. Next, you wait for the connection
    to be `opened`, which results in a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/ReadableStream)
    and/or a [`WritableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/WritableStream).

    method, you finally obtain a [`ReadableStreamDefaultReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader),
    which you can then [`read()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader/read)
    data from until the stream is done, that is, until it returns an object of the
    form `{value: undefined, done: true}`.'

    free", no extra steps needed. If `process()` takes extra time, the next message
    will only be consumed once the pipeline is ready. Likewise the `WritableStreamDefaultWriter.write()`
    step will only proceed if it is safe to do so.
