    within the U.S., it owes $22.50 in tax. If the airline charges $220 to fly you
    plus separately charges $40 each way for the bag, then your total cost is the
    same — but the airline only owes the government $16.50 in taxes. Splitting out
    baggage charges saves the airline $6.

    This is why major airlines charge $35 to $40 [for bags if you’re flying domestically](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/baggage/checked-baggage-policy.jsp),
    but don’t charge a bag fee when you’re flying to Europe or Asia.

    airline passengers. The government’s data showed mishandled bags peaked in 2007
    with about seven reports of lost or damaged luggage for every thousand passengers.
    That means you could expect your luggage to go on a different trip than the one
    you are taking about once every 140 or so flights. By 2018, that estimate had
    fallen to once every 350 flights.
