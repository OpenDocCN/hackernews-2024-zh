    on the 10th floor of Google’s New York City office around lunchtime to check out
    the protest.

    didn’t talk to any of them, I talked to folks who were standing up, passing out
    flyers, doing other roles,” he said, adding that the protesters were wearing matching
    T-shirts.

    5PM. “I chatted with them for maybe four minutes, like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re still
    sitting here! How’s it going?’” he said. Then, he finished the workday from a
    nearby couch. The worker says he returned to Google the following day without
    incident. That night, while at dinner, he got an email from Google saying he had
    been terminated.

    having a voice,” said the former employee, who worked at Google for almost three
    years and was part of the Alphabet Workers Union leadership. (The Alphabet Workers
    Union is [a non-contract union](https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/),

    offices in New York City and Sunnyvale, California, in protest of Project Nimbus,
    a $1.2 billion cloud computing contract with the Israeli government. Those workers
    [were also arrested](/2024/4/17/24133056/google-protests-project-nimbus-no-tech-for-apartheid).
    The company then [fired 28 employees in connection with the protests](/2024/4/17/24133700/google-fires-28-employees-protest-israel-cloud-contract).
    In an internal memo to staff, Chris Rackow, Google’s head of global security,

    read. “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook
    conduct that violates our policies, think again. The company takes this extremely
    seriously, and we will continue to apply our longstanding policies to take action
    against disruptive behavior — up to and including termination.”

    him and others in the lounge and asked to see their Google badges to make sure
    there were no outside participants. “It didn’t even occur to me that I shouldn’t
    show him my badge. He’s the security guard in the place that I work, and I was
    doing nothing wrong,” the worker said.

    Section 7 rights by terminating and/or placing them on administrative leave in
    response to their protected concerted activity, namely, participation (or perceived
    participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly
    connected to their terms and conditions of work,” the complaint reads.

    Verge* reported at the time, the petition began with an internally shared Google
    Doc, and all subsequent steps were also organized using Google products. Employees
    also [urged Google to drop Project Maven](/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire),
    its contract with the US Department of Defense. That same year, over 20,000 Google
