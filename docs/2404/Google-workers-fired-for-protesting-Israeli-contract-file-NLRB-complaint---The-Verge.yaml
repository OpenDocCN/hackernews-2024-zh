    5PM. “I chatted with them for maybe four minutes, like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re still
    sitting here! How’s it going?’” he said. Then, he finished the workday from a
    nearby couch. The worker says he returned to Google the following day without
    incident. That night, while at dinner, he got an email from Google saying he had

    years and was part of the Alphabet Workers Union leadership. (The Alphabet Workers
    Union is [a non-contract union](https://collectiveaction.tech/2021/the-abcs-of-googles-new-union/),

    there were no outside participants. “It didn’t even occur to me that I shouldn’t
    show him my badge. He’s the security guard in the place that I work, and I was

    Section 7 rights by terminating and/or placing them on administrative leave in
