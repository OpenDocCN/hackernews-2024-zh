    a day passes without a [new headline](https://thenextweb.com/news/when-will-agi-arrive-tech-experts-predict-artificial-general-intelligence) about
    the concept, which envisions computer systems outperforming humans at various

    argue that“there is no such thing as AGI” because “human intelligence is nowhere
    near general.” The Frenchman [prefers](https://thenextweb.com/news/how-facebooks-yann-lecun-is-charting-a-path-to-human-level-intelligence)

    it would take a human around 100,000 years to read all the text ingested by a
    leading LLM. But that’s not our primary method of learning.
