- en: Since early-March 2024, the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has received
    over 2,000 complaints reporting smishing^([1](#fn1)) texts representing road toll
    collection service from at least three states. IC3 complaint information indicates
    the scam may be moving from state-to-state.

    on your record. To avoid a late fee of $50.00, visit https://myturnpiketollservices.com

    identical language. The "outstanding toll amount" is similar among the complaints
    reported to the IC3\. However, the link provided within the text is created to
    impersonate the state's toll service name, and phone numbers appear to change
    between states.
