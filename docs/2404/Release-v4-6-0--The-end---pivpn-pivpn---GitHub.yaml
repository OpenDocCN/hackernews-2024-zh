- en: I inherited this project from [@0-kaladin](https://github.com/0-kaladin) and
    [@redfast00](https://github.com/redfast00), who moved on with their lives. I maintained
    it as my own with the great help of [@orazioedoardo](https://github.com/orazioedoardo),
    to whom I'm immensely grateful. He held the boat and kept it floating while I
    could not be present, and he too gave a lot of himself to this project!

- en: I've been giving less and less attention to PiVPN, and the desire to keep up
    with it is no longer what it once was. When PiVPN was created, it filled a big
    void and had a clear mission and purpose, which I feel has been fulfilled! We
    went from OpenVPN being something hard to set up and complicated to manage, to
    WireGuard being able to run on any toaster and easy to set up. There are so many
    tools out there that do the job much better than PiVPN does, and I genuinely believe
    PiVPN's mission in life was accomplished and is no longer relevant. Just as everything
    in nature has a start, there's also an end, and this is how PiVPN ends its journey.

- en: PiVPN has been home for so many of you, starting with Linux, bash, open-source,
    and everyone was always very welcomed, just like it was for me [7 years ago](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/commit/fbec57d1fda70341394bfd2bc90e1dab0af2c125).
    I cannot express how grateful I am to all the [84 Contributors](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/graphs/contributors)
    for this amazing project.

    be maintained. Unless [@0-kaladin](https://github.com/0-kaladin) rises back again
    and decides otherwise.

- en: The PiVPN Website and its documentation are hosted on GitHub, therefore it will
    remain accessible under the pivpn.io domain for as long as [@0-kaladin](https://github.com/0-kaladin)
    keeps paying the bills, just the same way I will keep hosting the redirection
    for the installation for as long as possible. I will still make a few commits
    to update the documentation about the project's state, but that will be it.
  prefs: []

- en: I will maintain ownership of the repository, but I won't pass it down to anyone
    else. First, because I feel it's not up to me to decide who to pass the project
    down to, and second, because there is no one else to pass the project to.
