    BBC Micro, Commodore, Atari ST, Spectrum, Archimedes and Amstrad CPC (although,
    strictly speaking, Issue 1 contained no Amstrad CPC content - from Issue 2 it
    did.). The magazine was 99 pence and only lasted 12 issues (August 1990 to July
    1991).

    cartoons/jokes, reader questions and type-ins. Sometimes the type-ins would specific
    only to certain platforms, other times they would provide you with the lines to
    change in order to make it work for your platform.
