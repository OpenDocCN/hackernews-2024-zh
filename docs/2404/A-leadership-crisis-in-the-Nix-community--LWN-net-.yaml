- en: On April 21, a group of anonymous authors and non-anonymous signatories published
    [a lengthy open letter](https://save-nix-together.org/) to the [Nix](https://nixos.org/)
    community and Nix founder Eelco Dolstra calling for his resignation from the project.
    They claimed ongoing problems with the project's leadership, primarily focusing
    on the way his actions have allegedly undermined people nominally empowered to
    perform various moderation and governance tasks. Since its release, the letter
    has gained more than 100 signatures.

    a non-profit organization that handles the project's finances and legal responsibilities.
    The foundation itself is headed by a board with five voting members, chaired by
    Dolstra. There are no term limits, and the board selects its own membership and
    chair. According to [the board's team page](https://nixos.org/community/teams/foundation-board/),
    its responsibilities include handling "<q>administrative, legal, and financial
    tasks</q>", sponsorships and donations, funding for "<q>community events and efforts</q>",
    and acting as an arbiter in case of conflicts in the community. Notably, the board
    "<q>is not responsible for technical leadership, decisions, or direction</q>",
    nor is it expected to handle all decision making. The board is responsible for
    providing "<q>a framework for teams to self-organize</q>", including a duty to
    "<q>[h]and out the credentials and permissions required for the teams' work</q>".

    with consensus having been formed on a policy that allows community veto of NixCon
    sponsors, Eelco (and Graham [Christensen], at the same time) appeared at the [open
    board call over 45 minutes in](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/open-board-call-2024-03-20/41898/),

    with, which had already been agreed upon by everyone but him.

- en: Christensen is Dolstra's co-founder at [Determinate Systems](https://determinate.systems/).
    The letter lists other examples, such as Dolstra blocking longtime contributors
    from becoming code reviewers or blocking a build-system change that had made it
    through the RFC process. The letter concludes that Dolstra is essentially leveraging
    social power from being the founder of the project to overrule decisions that
    are nominally supposed to be made collaboratively. In short, Dolstra is acting
    as "<q>the effective Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)</q>" of the project,
    even though the NixOS Foundation's charter doesn't grant anyone that authority.
    The letter says this leads to "<q>a culture of responsibility without authority</q>"
    that erodes contributors' desire to continue working on the project. It specifically
    mentions the moderation team as an example of this, saying that its members are
    "<q>in fear of their authority being undermined directly by Eelco or indirectly
    through the Foundation</q>".

    fairly well. We have been operating in an emergency mode most of the time for
    over half a year now. Our team retention is at an all time low, and we are barely
    able to keep up with recruiting new members as old ones quit. Right now the moderation
    team is down to four people, including two who desire to leave as soon as a replacement
    is found, not counting another moderator who left last week.

    of heavy antagonism from some community members or risks of destabilizing the
    community, and not because of an actual lack of power. Most of that is a reflection
    of a deeper cultural conflict within the community and not directly related to
    the foundation board.

    a military contractor that uses NixOS, has repeatedly attempted to become a sponsor
    of NixCon, which did not go over well with the community, as reflected in the
    minutes of the board meeting on March 20\. The letter says Dolstra pushed strongly
    for the inclusion of Anduril as a sponsor even after it became clear that many
    core contributors disagreed. Anduril was eventually dropped as a sponsor for ~~both~~
    [NixCon 2023](https://2023.nixcon.org/) ~~and [NixCon 2024](https://2024-na.nixcon.org/)
    after community pressure~~. [Thanks to Martin Weinelt for pointing out that [Anduril

    that Determinate Systems makes to customers. The company produces its own installer
    for Nix that the company promises will provide stable support for some Nix features.
