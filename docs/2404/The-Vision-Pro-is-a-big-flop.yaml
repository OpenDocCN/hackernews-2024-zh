    Pro? The company known for the iPhone and the Mac had a big task: to convince
    people to stick a computer on their faces for hours on end, experience the world
    through cameras and screens, isolate themselves from anyone around them, and pay
    $3,500 for the privilege. The [awkward photos of Tim Cook](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/tim-cook-apple-vision-pro?ref=disconnect.blog)

    it was a future to embrace.'

    There were plenty of reasons to believe it was going to be a dud, but there were
    still a sizeable number of people not willing to write off Apple’s next big thing.
    After all, this was Apple; one of the most valuable companies in the world that
    shaped personal computing with the Mac then led the mobile revolution with the
    iPhone. How could it get a major product release that it had poured $10 billion
    into so wrong? Its executives must’ve seen something us lowly consumers were missing.

    wave of hype as the early adopters got their hands on it. Videos proliferated
    of people using it in cars, on streets, and in planes — mainly for views, but
    it still got the discourse flowing. Even some critics came up with bad justifications
    to get their hands on one. But that didn’t change the fact it was a bad product
    that imagined [an anti-social future](https://disconnect.blog/apples-vision-pro-headset-deserves/)
    that other companies have tried and failed to foist on the public [many times
    before](https://www.wired.com/story/virtual-reality-rich-white-kid-of-technology/?ref=disconnect.blog).
    And in an all too rare moment, many tech reviewers agreed.

    Joanna Stern at the *Wall Street Journal* [opined](https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e?ref=disconnect.blog)
    that the Vision Pro was “the best mixed-reality headset I’ve ever tried,” but
    that companies like Apple know “these aren’t really the devices we want.” At *The
    Verge*, Nilay Patel was [even more damning](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price?ref=disconnect.blog),
    writing that the headset couldn’t “overcome the inherent nature of cameras and
    display” and “may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are
    actually dead ends.” In other words, the Vision Pro wasn’t a first step toward
    an augmented reality future but a moment to accept that vision would never be
    properly realized.

    those engineers and their managers imagined. Before the 14-day return window closed,
    there were plenty of reports of people heading back to the Apple store or popping
    their headsets back in the post to [get their money back](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072792/apple-vision-pro-early-adopters-returns?ref=disconnect.blog).
    They bought into the hype, they tried the new thing, and they ultimately realized
    it wasn’t worth it. That’s now being reflected in the sales numbers.

    in its first year, but slowly revised that number down to 900,000\. When the product
    was released, estimates pegged [initial sales](https://mashable.com/article/apple-vision-pro-sold-2000000?ref=disconnect.blog)
    at around 200,000 units, though it’s not clear how many of those were returned.
    Even people who kept their devices have recently been sharing on social media
    that they rarely use them anymore. It was no surprise on Tuesday when Apple analyst
    Ming-Chi Kuo reported Apple had [slashed Vision Pro production](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138487/apple-vision-pro-cut-shipment-forecast-kuo-rumor?ref=disconnect.blog)
    even before its international launch, expecting to sell as little as 400,000 units
    this year. Kuo also suggested a cheaper version had been pushed beyond 2025, if
    the company makes one at all.

    years](https://disconnect.blog/roundup-elizabeth-holmes-is-behind/). But crypto’s
    failure was a mixture of bad product and public opposition, while the metaverse
    was even more a rejection of a future where we would all be wearing headsets on
    our faces and socializing in virtual environments instead of with real people
    in meatspace. Like with Google Glass back in 2014, it was the [public revulsion](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-francisco-woman-says-she-was-attacked-for-wearing-google-glass/?ref=disconnect.blog)

    did a deep dive on how poorly the product worked and explained that viewers shouldn’t
    buy into a product simply because of the vision of what it hopes to be in the
    future. He’s absolutely right about that. Former AWS engineer Daniel Vassallo
    was not happy about it though, writing on Twitter that he found it “[almost unethical](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1779753281960722706?ref=disconnect.blog)”
    because reviewers have a duty to “do no harm” — which absolutely is not the case.

    often tempered by a desire to maintain a good relationship with major tech firms.

    —— 这显然不是事实。评论员有责任对他们的观众或读者诚实，尽管这通常受到与主要科技公司保持良好关系的愿望的限制。
