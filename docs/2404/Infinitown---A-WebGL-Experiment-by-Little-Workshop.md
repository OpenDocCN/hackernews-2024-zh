# Infinitown | A WebGL Experiment by Little Workshop

> 来源：[https://demos.littleworkshop.fr/infinitown](https://demos.littleworkshop.fr/infinitown)

This WebGL experiment is an attempt to create a procedural city that feels alive and is fun to watch.

First, we generate a finite grid of random city blocks. Then, using some tricks, the viewpoint wraps around this grid, which creates the illusion of an endless cityscape.

Made with: Three.js, Blender, Unity.
Models by VenCreations.
