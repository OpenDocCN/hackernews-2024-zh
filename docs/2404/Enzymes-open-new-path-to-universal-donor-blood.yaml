- en: The quest to develop universal donor blood has taken a decisive step forward.
    Researchers at DTU and Lund University have discovered enzymes that, when mixed
    with red blood cells, are able to remove specific sugars that make up the A and
    B antigens in the human AB0 blood groups. The results have been [published in
    the scientific journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01663-4) *[Nature
    Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01663-4).*

    A and B antigens, but also extended variants previously not recognized as problematic
    for transfusion safety. We are close to being able to produce universal blood
    from group B donors, while there is still work to be done to convert the more
    complex group A blood. Our focus is now to investigate in detail if there are
    additional obstacles and how we can improve our enzymes to reach the ultimate
    goal of universal blood production," says Professor Maher Abou Hachem, who is
    the study leader at DTU and one of the senior scientists behind the discovery.*'

    that define the four AB0 blood groups A, B, AB and 0\. These antigens control
    compatibility between donors and recipients for safe blood transfusion and organ
    transplantation. Donor blood is screened for disease markers and the main blood
    groups. It can then be stored refrigerated for up to 42 days.**'

    of the population and more patients undergoing blood-intensive medical procedures.
    Successfully converting A or B blood types into AB0 universal donor blood can
    markedly reduce the logistics and costs currently associated with storing four
    different blood types. In addition, the development of universal donor blood will
    lead to an increased supply of donor blood by reducing the waste of blood approaching
    its expiry date.'

    donor blood is because they can trigger life-threatening immune reactions when
    transfused into non-matched recipients.

- en: The concept of using enzymes to generate universal donor blood was introduced
    more than 40 years ago. Since then, higher efficiency enzymes to remove the A
    and B antigens were discovered, but researchers are still not able to explain
    or abolish all immune reactions related to the blood, and therefore these enzymes
    are still not used in clinical practice.

    bacterium *Akkermansia muciniphila* that feeds by breaking down the mucus, which
    covers the surface of the gut. It turns out that these enzymes are exceptionally
