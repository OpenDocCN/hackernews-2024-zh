    in order to buy something. If you are shopping online, you can store your credit
    card numbers on your computer and just hit "click to pay." In a store, call up
    Apple Pay or Google Pay on your smartphone and tap it against the payment terminal.

    researchers found that customers charged 9.4% more on average to their credit
    cards, through both online and in-person transactions, after they adopted a mobile
    payment method than they had before.

    card debt. But the paper's lead author, [Yuqian Xu](https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/faculty/directory/yuqian-xu/),
    an assistant professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University
    of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told NPR she believes they probably play a significant
    role.

    population uses mobile payments](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/10/are-americans-embracing-mobile-payments),
    Xu estimates that approximately 4.5% of total credit card usage in the country
    is due to the influence of frictionless payments. That means, she calculates,
    that about $50 billion of [the $1.13 trillion in current consumer credit card
    debt](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html) can be attributed to
    the ease mobile payment apps present.

    use mobile payments in the U.S. likely follows a pretty similar pattern?**'
  prefs: []

- en: Yes. A fundamental mechanism here is the convenience that mobile payments bring
    to consumers. Therefore, we would expect that the effect would be similar in the
    U.S. mobile payment market.

    compared to just 30 seconds to buy it with a smartphone. Can just 10 seconds make
    people change their buying habits?**'

- en: The main reason underlying the increase in usage is convenience. And the convenience
    manifests in two primary ways. This swift transaction process contributed significantly
    to the overall convenience experienced by users. But there's another part of the
    convenience derived from the absence of the need to carry additional physical
    cards or a wallet.

- en: Yes, I do find that actually. In the past, I tended to forget to bring my physical
    cards. And this actually sometimes created a barrier to buy things. But I don't
    tend to forget my mobile phone. I bring my mobile phone every day. So I find I
    purchase more with mobile payments.

  prefs: []

- en: I would say, don't avoid these mobile payment apps. Technological advancements
    can offer us a lot of convenience and improve the security of financial transactions.
    What's most important is that people need to be aware of these dynamics — we can
    better manage our financial resources, potentially reducing impulsive expenditures.
