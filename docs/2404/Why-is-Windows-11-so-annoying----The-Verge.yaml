    work-issued MacBook Air can run. So I switched to my five-year-old Windows desktop
    and plugged in another monitor. Love it. Productivity through the roof. But it
    means that I’m finally spending significant time in Windows 11, and *gosh,* is
    it janky.

    All the games are there, for one thing, and Windows runs on all sorts of hardware
    without a lot of fiddling. You do not have to spend a thousand dollars minimum
    on a non-upgradable machine to use it. You also generally do not have to download
    a bunch of drivers or spend six hours in the command line hand-assembling the
    goddamn operating system.

    relatively sedate macOS for work and my off-work hours spending as little time
    as possible at a computer. So, even though I upgraded my desktop to Windows 11
    about a year ago, I hadn’t spent that much time with it. When I did use my PC,
    it was mostly for household admin or (rarely) playing a game and, therefore, not
    interacting much with the OS itself. I am a frog who’s been out of the pot; I
    just jumped back in and got scalded.

    in the usual fashion — by hitting Windows and starting to type — it mostly shows
    me results from the web, which are useless because it’s using Bing to find them.

    That info used to be baked into the OS. Now if you are in the display settings

    — bings the phrase “*how to add multiple monitors to your windows 11 pc site:microsoft.com*,”
    and displays a page with a single result: an info box [excerpting the relevant
    support page on Microsoft’s website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-windows-329c6962-5a4d-b481-7baa-bec9671f728a),
