    (NAT) and IPv4 to protect their investments, with the result that transition to
    IPv6 is glacial while the entire internet is shaped in the image of incumbent
    players.

    the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC).

    titled "IP addressing in 2021" that reports on IPv4 and IPv6 usage across last
    year.

    The headline news is that the small pool of available IPv4 addresses continued
    to dwindle, even as trading in addresses increased. IPv6 adoption, meanwhile,
    grew by just three per cent – and tellingly, no major player made the move to
    the newer protocol last year.

    to a very restricted model of simple client/server interactions.

    the widespread use of NAT masks the fact that the internet is largely stuck on
    IPv4 because incumbents don't see the need to change.

    no longer being sustained in today''s network.'

    large players, each of whom appears to be assuming a very strong position within

    tend towards risk aversion, conservatism, and increased levels of control across
    their scope of operation."'

    by Latin American internet registry LATNIC [suggested](https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/09/study_on_the_internets_technical_success_factors/)
    that big tech's in-house networks carry a huge slice of global traffic, giving
    the likes of Google and Facebook enormous influence over internet architecture.

    industry has quite profound implications in terms of network neutrality, separation
    of carriage and service provision function, investment profiles, expectations
    of risk and return on infrastructure investments, and on the openness of the internet
    itself.

    challenging to sustain an efficient, fully open, and competitive industry, but
    the degree of challenge in this agenda is multiplied many-fold when the underlying
    platform has run out of the basic currency of IP addresses," he writes.'
