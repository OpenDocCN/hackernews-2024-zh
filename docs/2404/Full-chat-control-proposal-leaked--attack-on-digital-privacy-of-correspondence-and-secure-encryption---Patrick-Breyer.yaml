- en: The French news service contexte.com has today published the latest Belgian
    Presidency’s proposal for introducing indiscriminate [chat control scanning of
    private messages for illegal content.](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-03-28-conseil-csam-compromis-presidence-belge.pdf)
    The proposal covers the entire regulation and is therefore ready for endorsement.
    The proposal is to be discussed tomorrow in a Council law enforcement working
    party. The [political points of contention will then be decided in COREPER](https://netzpolitik.org/2024/internes-protokoll-eu-staaten-weiter-uneins-ueber-chatkontrolle/)
    in order to adopt the position by June.

    the nature of detection orders. Millions of private chats and private photos of
    law-abiding citizens are to be searched and leaked using flawed technology, without
    them being even remotely connected to child sexual abuse – this destroys our digital
    privacy of correspondence. Despite lip service being paid to encryption, client-side
    scanning is to be used to undermine previously secure end-to-end encryption in
    order to turn our smartphones into spies – this destroys secure encryption.

    because EU governments that have been critical so far are praising the repackaged
    plans, which means that the blocking minority no longer stands. Not even a written
    opinion of the Council’s legal service on this obvious violation of fundamental
    rights has been requested, it seems.

    position, experience shows that the Parliament risks gradually abandoning its
    initial position behind closed doors and agreeing to bad and dangerous compromises
    that fundamentally put our online security at risk.”

    searches to ‘high-risk services’ is meaningless because every communication service
    is misused also for sharing illegal images and therefore has an imminently high
    risk of abuse. Ireland – one of the strongest proponents of chat control – would
    be classifying the major services. In any case, the service used is no justification
    for searching the private chats of millions of citizens who are not even remotely
    connected to any wrongdoing.'

    flagged beach pictures or consensual sexting rarely involve just a single photo.
    The EU Commissioner for Home Affairs has herself herself stated that three out
    of four of the disclosed chats and photos are not actionable for the police. These
    algorithms and hash databases are totally unreliable in distinguishing legal from
    illegal content.”
