- en: In a virtual meeting with reporters, Salehpour said Boeing was so eager to meet
    its production goals that it took "shortcuts" when it fastened together the carbon-composite
    fuselage of the 787\. That could dramatically shorten the life of the plane, he
    warned, potentially causing it to break apart in mid-flight.

  zh: 在与记者进行的虚拟会议中，Salehpour称，波音为了达到生产目标，对787的碳复合材料机身进行了"捷径"，这可能会大大缩短飞机的使用寿命。他警告说，这可能导致飞机在飞行中分崩离析。
- en: '"I''m doing this not because I want Boeing to fail, but because I want it to
    succeed, and prevent crashes from happening," Salehpour said. "The truth is, Boeing
    can''t keep going the way it is. It needs to do a little bit better, I think."'
