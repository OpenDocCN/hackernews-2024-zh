    with alarming claims about two of the company's jets, including [the 787 Dreamliner](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/08/26/139979114/feds-say-boeings-787-dreamliner-is-ready-for-passengers).

    its production goals that it took "shortcuts" when it fastened together the carbon-composite
    fuselage of the 787\. That could dramatically shorten the life of the plane, he
    warned, potentially causing it to break apart in mid-flight.
