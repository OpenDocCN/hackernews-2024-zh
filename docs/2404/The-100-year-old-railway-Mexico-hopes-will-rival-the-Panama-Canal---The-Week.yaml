    of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, in the hope that the route can one day rival
    the Panama Canal.

    project of President [Andres Manuel López Obrador](https://theweek.com/speedreads/782448/andrs-manuel-lpez-obrador-wins-mexican-presidential-election),
    the interoceanic railway will run for 303km across Mexico's narrowest point, with
    the main line running between the port cities of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, and Coatzacoalcos,
    Veracruz.

- en: The revival of the railway line means that a ship could "unload its cargo from
    one side, send it by rail across the Isthmus, and reload it back onto another
    ship on the other side", thereby providing a new route through which international
    freight could flow, explained [Mexico News Daily](https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2023/10/what-is-the-interoceanic-corridor-and-how-does-mexico-want-to-compete-with-the-panama-canal/).

- en: Originally part of the Tehuantepec line, the railway was first built for the
    government of dictator Porfirio Diaz and was inaugurated in 1907, before the Mexican
    Revolution and the opening of the Panama Canal "devastated business", said the
    FT.

- en: The $2.8 billion project has been "buoyed" by Mexico's increasingly important
    trading relationship with the US; the country "surpassed China this year to become
    the US's top trading partner", said [The Daily Upside](https://www.thedailyupside.com/policy-power/mexico-reviving-transcoastal-railway-to-capitalize-on-dry-panama-canal/?ref=biztoc.com).
    Given that America's relationship with [China](https://theweek.com/economy/1025866/china-slowdown-us-recession)
    remains "decidedly frosty", Mexico can "feel secure in its new position for a
    while longer".

    relies on fresh water for its operation, faced its worst drought on record, causing
    significant delays.'

    canal from an average of 40 to 32 in order to save water, with each shipping vessel
    requiring some "200 million litres of freshwater to move through the canal's locks",
    said [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/25/panama-canal-drought-causes-shipping-backlog-amid-christmas-rush#:~:text=suffers%20from%20drought-,The%20Panama%20Canal%20depends%20on%20rainwater%20to%20move%20vessels%20through,exacerbating%20the%20drought%2C%20meteorologists%20say.).

- en: It is here that Mexico has spied its most significant opportunity; the government
    is "bullish" about the new rail route's prospects, as it will offer "proximity
    to the US and a transit time of 6.5 hours excluding loading time – less than the
    eight to 10 hours it takes on the 80km canal", said the FT.

- en: Mexico's Secretary of Economy Raquel Buenrostro told the paper that Mexico's
    investment in railway infrastructure was "a real and increasingly important alternative",
    as the world faces increasing changes due to the climate crisis. In July, the
    minister said the trade corridor could account for as much as 5% of Mexico's GDP,
    reported [Mexico News Daily](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/economy-minister-isthmus-corridor-to-contribute-5-percent-gdp/).

    "Definitely the Mexican solution could be a potential threat to the Panamanian
    operation," but he added a replacement route would only be needed "if we were
    in a situation where there is no water at all, and we do not anticipate that".'

    capacity would be about 10.5% of the total amount of goods carried through the
    Panama Canal in 2022, according to calculations from the FT.
