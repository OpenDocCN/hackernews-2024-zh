    weather was miserable: hard-frozen snowbanks in every gutter, skating-rink sidewalks,
    roads so ripped up by rock salt and plow blades that I had to return my first
    rental car, because it shook like a leaf if I took it above thirty. I had come
    to see the band Derecho (since rechristened the Derecho Rhythm Section), the newest
    project of Alan Sparhawk, who for three decades fronted the seminal indie-rock
    band Low, which he co-founded with his wife, Mimi Parker.'

  zh: 去年冬天，我飞往明尼阿波利斯去听一个放克四重奏在一家酒吧演出。天气非常糟糕：每个排水沟都结着冰冻的雪堆，人行道成了滑冰场，道路上被岩盐和犁铲彻底破坏，以至于我不得不退还第一辆租来的车，因为如果开到三十英里以上它就像叶子一样颤抖。我来看的是Derecho乐队（后来改名为Derecho节奏组），这是Alan
    Sparhawk的最新项目，他三十年来一直是开创性独立摇滚乐队Low的前线，与妻子Mimi Parker共同创立。
- en: Sparhawk had grown his hair out during the pandemic, and the red-blond mane
    was still shaggy past his shoulders. He wore work boots, a black T-shirt, brown
    overalls, and a black beanie that came off as the room warmed up. As in Low, he
    plays guitar and sings lead. Cyrus Sparhawk, his and Parker’s nineteen-year-old
    son, plays bass and writes much of the music. On this icy night, the Sparhawk
    boys—abetted by Al Church and Izzy Cruz on percussion—served up two piping-hot
    sets of Roy Ayers, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Childish Gambino covers, alongside
    a handful of original compositions.

    Sparhawk负责担任贝斯手并创作大部分音乐。在这个冰冷的夜晚，Sparhawk家的男孩们——加上Al Church和Izzy Cruz的打击乐——演奏了两组热情洋溢的Roy
    Ayers、Parliament-Funkadelic和Childish Gambino的翻唱曲目，以及几首原创作品。

    and two bootleggers, whose taping rigs sat on their tables, beside their chicken
    wings. Sparhawk noted their presence with bemusement but without concern. The
    music was tight, buoyant, punk-inflected, and exploratory enough to explain what
    the tapers were doing there. Between songs, Sparhawk joked about the band being
    willing to play weddings and bar mitzvahs—any gig that paid. It was a happy, high-spirited
    show, but there was unspoken sorrow in the air.

    past few albums had been critical hits. A pandemic-era live-from-home concert
    series had deepened the connection to old fans and won over a legion of new ones.
    Cyrus, Parker and Sparhawk’s younger child, had come of age. Low should have been
    out on tour, taking well-deserved victory laps across the U.S. and Europe, claiming
    its rightful place in the indie-rock pantheon alongside the likes of Pavement,

    But there was no more Low. In late 2020, Mimi Parker had been given a diagnosis
    of ovarian cancer. After a brutal two-year struggle, she died on November 5, 2022\.
    She was fifty-five years old. As Parker and Sparhawk themselves sing in uncanny

- en: Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker were childhood friends turned high-school sweethearts
    turned longtime artistic collaborators. Across four decades, thirteen albums,
    five bass players, and two children—through Sparhawk’s semi-public struggles with
    mental illness and addiction in the early two-thousands, as well as Parker’s more
    recent and more private illness—they produced one of the most singular bodies
    of music in the history of rock. Low’s sound is solemn, sometimes glacial, with
    elliptical lyrics that often touch on questions of faith. (Sparhawk was raised
    Mormon; Parker converted before they married.) The band’s music demands patience
    and attention, which it repays in beauty and transcendence, punctuated by occasional
    bursts of earworm jangle-pop or cathartic, pummelling storms of noise.

    Sparhawk 在二千年代初公开的心理疾病和药物成瘾问题，以及 Parker 近年来更加私密的病痛。他们创作了摇滚史上最独特的音乐之一。Low 的音乐风格庄严而有时冰冷，歌词富有椭圆形式，经常涉及信仰问题（Sparhawk
    是摩门教徒；Parker 在结婚前改信）。这支乐队的音乐需要耐心和专注，但回报以美丽和超凡脱俗，偶尔夹杂耳熟能详的流行摇滚旋律或情绪激烈、震撼的噪音风暴。

    that “beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror” and that it is on this account
    that “every angel is terrifying.” I’ve thought of Rilke often while listening
    to Low, because so much of the band’s work explores divine love, dissolving the
    border between awe and fear. In “Nothing But Heart,” from the album “C’mon” (2011),
    Sparhawk, adopting what I take to be the persona of God, sings, “I would be your
    king / But you want to be free / Confusion and art / I’m nothing but heart.” That
    last line is repeated at least twenty times, with Parker harmonizing, in the next
    several minutes, while the music builds to a whirlwind roar. The song is at once
    openhanded and gnomic, elegant and menacing. It’s the song that converted me—at
    a 2011 concert at Terminal 5, in New York City—from a casual, even dismissive
    listener to an ardent fan. When the band kicked into “Nothing But Heart,” I felt
    the nature and depth of my attention shift. It was as though the music were a
    long-locked door to which I’d finally found a key—or, better, as if I contained
    a long-locked door, which the music had finally pried open.'

    But Heart》中，收录于《C’mon》（2011）专辑中，Sparhawk 扮演了我认为是上帝的角色，唱道，“我可以成为你的国王/但你想要自由/混乱与艺术/我只是一颗心。”
    最后一句至少重复了二十次，而 Parker 和声加入，在接下来的几分钟里，音乐逐渐增强至旋风般的咆哮。这首歌既慷慨又深奥，优雅又威胁。正是这首歌，在纽约市
    Terminal 5 的一场2011年演唱会上，使我从一个随意、甚至轻视的听众，成为了一名热情的粉丝。当乐队演奏《Nothing But Heart》时，我感到了我的注意力的性质和深度发生了变化。就好像音乐是一个长久锁住的门，我终于找到了钥匙——或者更好地说，好像我体内有一扇长久锁住的门，音乐终于把它打开了。'

    a hardscrabble town of fewer than five hundred people. He was the new kid: his
    family had relocated from Utah because his father had bought a farm, pursuing
    what Sparhawk described to me as a “Mormon version of ‘back to the land’ ” for
    which the family was woefully ill-equipped. (Per the refrain of Low’s “California”:
    “Though it breaks your heart / we had to sell the farm.”) Parker also lived on
    a farm, and music ran in both families. Her mother had tried to break into country
    music, and her father sang around the house. Parker learned to sing by harmonizing
    with her older sisters. Sparhawk’s mother played church organ, and his father
    wrote songs and played drums in a country band. “If it were up to him, he played
    jazz,” Sparhawk said, “but, because of where we lived, that was the gig he could
    get. For a while, that was the only cash he made.”'

    Sparhawk 向我描述的“摩门教版本的‘回归自然’”，而家人明显缺乏准备。（如 Low 乐队的“California”中唱到：“虽然让你心碎/我们不得不卖掉农场。”）Parker
    也住在农场上，两个家庭都有音乐的底蕴。她的母亲曾试图进入乡村音乐圈，而她的父亲则在家里唱歌。Parker 通过与姐姐们的合唱学会了唱歌。Sparhawk 的母亲弹教堂风琴，他的父亲写歌并在一个乡村乐队中打鼓。“如果完全由他决定，他会玩爵士乐，”Sparhawk
    说，“但由于我们住的地方，那是他能找到的工作。有一段时间，那是他唯一赚钱的途径。”
- en: In Clearbrook, alcoholism was rampant and violence commonplace. In a 2021 interview,
    Parker said that the song “Laser Beam,” which she wrote, was based on a childhood
    memory of accompanying her mother to pick up her intoxicated father from a bar
    and watching from the back seat of the family car as he was maced by a cop in
    the parking lot. Sparhawk’s parents didn’t drink—they were practicing Mormons—but
    his father was mercurial. “I got some broken ribs from tussles with my father,”
    he told me, though he hastened to add, “I got tons of friends who put up with

    relationship—a way to express love. Sparhawk would watch his father play guitar,
    and, as he began to learn the instrument himself, they were able to play together.
    “It’s a language that’s untainted,” he said. “You completely connect with this
    person, and all the other stuff falls away.” In fifth grade, Parker joined the
    school band, drawn to drums because banging on stuff was fun and she didn’t have
    to learn to read music. Sparhawk started playing guitar around the same age. He
    couldn’t pinpoint when they started dating, but he remembered the first time they
    played music together. They were fifteen, and he was over at her house one day
    after school. He started playing Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold,” hoping she would
    join in on the harmony without his having to ask. She did.

    帕克在五年级加入了学校乐队，被鼓手吸引因为敲东西很有趣，她不必学习读谱。斯帕霍克在差不多同样的年纪开始弹吉他。他说不清楚他们何时开始约会，但他记得他们第一次一起演奏音乐。他们当时十五岁，一天放学后他在她家。他开始弹尼尔·扬的《心灵的黄金》，希望她能跟着和声，而不需要他开口要求。她答应了。
- en: Sparhawk spent a year at Brigham Young University before transferring to the
    University of Minnesota Duluth, where Parker was enrolled. They graduated and
    married. Duluth had a small but energetic music scene powered by an intensely
    communitarian ethos. “There’s a sense of camaraderie,” Sparhawk said. “We’re all
    trying to get through the winter, and the town is off the beaten path, with an
    underdog complex, so there’s a certain flavor to your determination.” Sparhawk
    and his friend John Nichols were in a rock band called Zen Identity, but they
    had grown restless. They were thinking about the inverse propositions suggested
    by loud, fast music. How much could you strip out of a song before it stopped
    being one? How slow—and, crucially, how low—could you play the remaining elements
    while still commanding the attention of a rock crowd?

    She devised a minimalist setup, playing with brushes more often than sticks. Sparhawk
    sang most of the leads, but it quickly became clear that the heart of Low’s sound
    was the harmonies that Parker and Sparhawk could achieve, along with Parker’s
    spare drumming. Their first album, “I Could Live in Hope,” was released in February
    of 1994 on Vernon Yard, then an imprint of Virgin Records. The music is hushed,
    skeletal, haunting. All the songs have one-word titles, and the album closes with
    a wrenching cover of “You Are My Sunshine” (listed simply as “Sunshine”) that
