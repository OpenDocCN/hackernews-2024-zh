    saturation, sharpen, blur, airbrush, clone stamp, etc. Even basic image editors
    offer dozens of useful image manipulation tools.'

    cut, copy, paste, find, replace, spell check — nothing that modifies the totality
    of the writing. This is changing.'

    images. A new set of tools is emerging, like Photoshop for text.

- en: Up until now, text editors have been focused on input. The next evolution of
    text editors will make it easy to alter, summarize and lengthen text. You’ll be
    able to do this for entire documents, not just individual sentences or paragraphs.
    The filters will be instantaneous and as good as if you wrote the text yourself.
    You will also be able to do this with [local files](/file-over-app), on your device,
    without relying on remote servers.

    clarity, grammar, tone — but these are rudimentary compared to the new capabilities
    that are being developed. Text filters will allow you to paraphrase text, so that
    you can switch easily between styles of prose: literary, technical, journalistic,
    legal, and more. You will be able to change an entire story chapter from first
    person to third person narration, or transform narrative descriptions into dialogue.'

- en: When Photoshop was created in the 1980s, it made image manipulation easy and
    reversible. Initially, many of Photoshop’s capabilities were adaptations of analog
    effects. For example, “dodge” and “burn” are old [darkroom techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkroom)
    used to alter photographs. There are countless [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph)
    names throughout digital image editing tools that refer to analog processes.

    Text seems like it would be easier to manipulate than images. But languages have
    far more rules than images do. A reader expects writing to follow proper spelling
    and grammar, a consistent tone, and a logical sequence of sentences. Until now,
    solving this problem required building complex rule-based algorithms. Now we can
    solve this problem with AI models that can teach themselves to create readable
    text in any language.

    summarize text, and even expand text with more granular detail, in surprising
    and creative ways.

- en: In a “[A camera for ideas](/synthography)”, I coined the term *synthography*
    to describe synthetic images created with generative models. Similarly, increasing
    amounts of text will be *synthscribed*, as in described, transcribed, inscribed
    — synthetically.

- en: These capabilities are all possible today, but will take time to refine. To
    make the experience as seamless as image manipulation, language models need to
    be local to the device so that they be *private*, *offline* and *future-proof*.
    I’m excited to see more efforts driving in this direction.

    become as mundane as “desaturate”, “Gaussian blur” or any other image filter,
    and unlock new creative potential.</content>
