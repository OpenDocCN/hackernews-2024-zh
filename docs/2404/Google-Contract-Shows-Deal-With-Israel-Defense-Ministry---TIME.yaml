    and the tech giant has negotiated deepening its partnership during Israel’s war
    in Gaza, a company document viewed by TIME shows.

- en: The Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to the document, has its own “landing
    zone” into Google Cloud—a secure entry point to Google-provided computing infrastructure,
    which would allow the ministry to store and process data, and access AI services.

- en: The ministry sought consulting assistance from Google to expand its Google Cloud
    access, seeking to allow “multiple units” to access automation technologies, according
    to a draft contract dated March 27, 2024\. The contract shows Google billing the
    Israeli Ministry of Defense over $1 million for the consulting service.

- en: The version of the contract viewed by TIME was not signed by Google or the Ministry
    of Defense. But a March 27 comment on the document, by a Google employee requesting
    an executable copy of the contract, said the signatures would be “completed offline
    as it’s an Israel/Nimbus deal.” Google also gave the ministry a 15% discount on
    the original price of consulting fees as a result of the “Nimbus framework,” the
    document says.

    in the Israeli press have previously indicated that Google and Amazon are contractually
    barred from preventing specific arms of the Israeli state using their technology
    under Project Nimbus. But this is the first time the existence of a contract showing
    that the Israeli Ministry of Defense is a Google Cloud customer has been made

    civilian purposes. “We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads
    running on our commercial platform by Israeli government ministries such as finance,
    healthcare, transportation, and education,” a Google spokesperson told TIME for
    a [story](https://time.com/6964364/exclusive-no-tech-for-apartheid-google-workers-protest-project-nimbus-1-2-billion-contract-with-israel/)

    military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.”

    in the Israeli media have alleged the country’s military, controlled by the Ministry
    of Defense, is using an AI-powered system to select targets for air-strikes on
    Gaza. Such an AI system would likely require cloud computing infrastructure to
    function. The Google contract seen by TIME does not specify for what military
    applications, if any, the Ministry of Defense uses Google Cloud, and there is
    no evidence Google Cloud technology is being used for targeting purposes. But
    Google employees who spoke with TIME said the company has little ability to monitor
    what customers, especially sovereign nations like Israel, are doing on its cloud
    infrastructure.

    is described in the contract as “phase 2” of a wider project to build out the
    ministry’s cloud architecture.

    work carried out by Google on behalf of the ministry. The ministry, the contract
    says, “has [already] established a Google Cloud Landing Zone infrastructure as
    part of their overall cloud strategy and to enable [the Ministry of Defense] to
    move applications to Google Cloud Platform.”

    looking to enable its Landing Zone to serve multiple units and sub-units. Therefore,
    [the Ministry of Defense] would like to create several different automation modules
    within their Landing Zone based on Google’s leading practices for the benefit
    of different units, with proper processes to support, and to implement leading
    practices for security and governance architecture using Google tools.”

    of Defense’s Google Cloud landing zone, the contract says. The estimated start
    date is April 14, and Google’s consulting services are expected to take one calendar
