    just to watch *The Best of Both Worlds* while my wife is at dinner with friends.
    Oh, wow, it won''t even deliver 5.1 surround sound to me unless I use [tiny list
    of ''approved devices'' that actually may or may not work, because the list is
    five years old, has never been updated, and includes stuff that isn''t even made
    anymore] and I can''t watch it on an airplane, and it has ads now (didn''t I pay
    to not have ads; oh apparently ''unskippable ads for other movies'' aren''t ''ads''
    got it) and the player interface sucks so much that I have to play a game of Sharp
    Shooter with the mouse to grab the two-pixel-wide seek handle, and the arrow keys
    don''t even seek at all, and turning subtitles on and off requires digging through
    six-layer-deep submenus, and the compression is so bad that despite being ''4K''
    it looks 100x worse than a BluRay. Oh, wow this 1gbit fiber connection sure is
    fast when it connects to twenty peers.” [MPAA freaks out about piracy]'
