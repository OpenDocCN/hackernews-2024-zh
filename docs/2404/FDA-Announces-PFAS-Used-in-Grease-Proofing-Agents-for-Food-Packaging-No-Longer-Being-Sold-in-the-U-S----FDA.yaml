- en: Today, the FDA announced that grease-proofing substances containing [Per and
    Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)](/food/environmental-contaminants-food/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas
    "Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)") are no longer being sold by manufacturers
    for food contact use in the U.S. market. The completion of the voluntary market
    phase-out of these substances used on food packaging paper and paperboard, eliminates
    the primary source of dietary exposure to PFAS from authorized food contact uses.

- en: To protect public health, in 2020, following our post-market safety assessment,
    the FDA obtained commitments from manufacturers to cease sales for food contact
    use in the U.S. of grease-proofing substances that contain certain types of PFAS.
    Today’s announcement marks the fulfillment of these voluntary commitments. In
    addition, the FDA has confirmed that other manufacturers have voluntarily stopped
    sales of other food contact substances (which contain different types of PFAS)
    intended for use as grease-proofing agents in the U.S.

- en: Grease-proofing substances are applied on paper and paperboard packaging to
    prevent the leaking of grease and oil, and for water-resistant properties. The
    substances containing PFAS were applied to fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn
    bags, take-out paperboard containers, pet food bags, as well as other similar
    types of packaging. While the original commitment letters received by the FDA
    from the manufacturers state that paper and paperboard products containing these
    food contact substances could take 18 months to exhaust the market supply from
    the last date of sale, most of the companies have exited the market prior to their
    original phase-out date. In addition, FDA is working towards a validated analytical
    method that would allow us to monitor the market for these food contact substances
    in food packaging.
