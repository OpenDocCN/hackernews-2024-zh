- en: After [launching the Firefox Nightly .deb package](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2023/10/30/introducing-mozillas-firefox-nightly-deb-packages-for-debian-based-linux-distributions/),
    feedback highlighted a demand for ARM64 builds. In response, we’re excited to
    now offer Firefox Nightly for ARM64 as both `.tar` archives and `.deb` packages.
    Keep the suggestions coming – feedback is always welcome!

- en: We want to be upfront about the current state of our ARM64 builds. Although
    we are confident in the quality of Firefox on this architecture, we are still
    incorporating comprehensive ARM64 testing into Firefox’s continuous integration
    and release pipeline. Our goal is to integrate ARM64 builds into Firefox’s extensive
    automated test suite, which will enable us to offer this architecture across the
    beta, release, and ESR channels.
