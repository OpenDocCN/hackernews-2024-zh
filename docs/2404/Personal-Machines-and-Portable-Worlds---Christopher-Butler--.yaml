    had a lot to do with the range of replies I received. The older people told me
    about pull-string “talking” toys, reel-to-reel tape players, and the family’s
    first color television. People my age recalled things that I, too, had used from
    early on — gadgets like the Speak and Spell, the Sony Walkman, Atari consoles,
    calculator watches, and more. Younger people seemed to not understand the question,
    at least not in the same way those of us of Generation X or prior did. I got answers,
    but they often came with explanations like, “I dunno…everything was technology…this
    was just my *favorite* thing.” And, at least in my observation, most of those
    favorite things were much closer to the sort of personal device *everyone* has
    today. Things like the LeapFrog Leapster (a portable gaming system), the Sidekick
    (a mobile phone), and the iPod — all mentioned — not only have counterparts still
    in wide use today but were created at a time when personal computing was already

    and now find to be almost mysterious. But to be *personal* it has to be a certain
    kind of device — the kind that balances access to another world with the kinds
    of limits and boundaries that make a thing private. That balance is something
    I’ve always been able to point to in particular objects — *this* has it, but *that*
    does not — but describing it on its own, as a set of rules or characteristics,

    The cost was no longer being able to send articles from the web to my machine
    and reading them, as well as books, in bed. The benefit was not having too many
    choices in front of me when I just want to read one thing. I went back to the
    printed book. You could say that’s as much of an affectation in 2023 as playing
    a vinyl record. Maybe. But it’s a choice.

    up in my home office. The cost is I can’t work from my couch or the local coffee
    shop. The benefit is I have some separation in my life between work and not work.

    personal experience.

    that did less and imagining collecting them and using them again. In some cases,
    I’ve done that. I started using a minidisc player again recently. It’s much more
    work and has many more limitations than just opening up Apple Music on my phone.
    But, it’s fun and it’s *mine*. I own a few other pieces of old tech that mean
    something to me — my old Gameboy, my first cellphone, an old Handspring Visor.
    I keep these things running not for primary use, but to periodically re-experience
    that old feeling of using something that did less and required more of my imagination.
    Friction is underrated.

    use, I often find myself feeling like I’m looking at a door to a world. I look
    at a book — there’s a world. Every playable disc in our house — each a world.

    Mau and his cohort wrote about are not safely reducible. Maybe we can’t decomplexify
    the world of things. Maybe. And if we can, I wouldn’t dare imagine it could happen
    quickly.

    despite there being sleeker, faster, frictionless options available? What limits
    do we embrace so that we can re-balance the human with the machine?

    to use things that only do a part of what readily available alternatives do and
    more. I’ve chosen to stop using some things altogether. I have found that these
    choices have enhanced my experiences because they’ve supported true insight; they’ve
    helped me be more aware of what I’m doing, why I’m doing it, and who I am becoming.
    I have found that they change the world because they change my world.

    world. A good personal machine reveals that world and helps us shape it.
