    Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is finally set to make its inaugural crewed launch.

    with NASA officials giving the green light for liftoff at 10:34 p.m. ET Monday.
    Starliner will carry NASA’s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to the [International
    Space Station](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/13/world/mira-robot-first-surgery-in-space-scn/index.html),
    marking what could be a momentous and long-awaited victory for the beleaguered

    said Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing, during
    a Thursday news briefing. “There’s a number of things that were surprises along
    the way that we had to overcome. … It certainly made the team very, very strong.
    I’m very proud of how they’ve overcome every single issue that we’ve encountered
    and gotten us to this point.”

    Crew Program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/commercial-crew-program-overview/),
    a partnership with private industry contractors. From the outset, the space agency
    aimed to have both companies operating at once. The Crew Dragon and Starliner
    spacecraft would each serve as a backup to the other, giving astronauts the option
    to keep flying, even if technical issues or other setbacks grounded one spacecraft.
