- en: Prefixes are treacherous little beasts. Just when you think you've come to an
    understanding, prefixes such as [*in*-](/dictionary/in-) will come along and carry
    meanings such as “not,” “in, within,” “into,” “toward,” or “put into or onto.”
    And to make things worse, some of the beginnings of words which appear to be prefixes
    aren’t prefixes at all, even if they seem to function in the same manner.

- en: Why are we bringing this up? Well, we didn’t want to tell you in this way, but
    we didn’t want you to hear it from someone else, either. There’s a new sense of
    [*nonplussed*](/dictionary/nonplussed) that people have been using, and…well,
    we’d just like to give you fair warning in case our descriptivist nature causes
    us to take action. This new sense appears to stem from a mistaken belief that
    the first three letters of *nonplus* are there to indicate that someone is something
    other than “plussed” (although what being plussed would entail here remains a
    mystery).

- en: It’s somewhat questionable whether the *non* in *nonplus* is actually a prefix
    at all; the word came into English in the 16th century, and was taken from the
    Latin *non plus*, which means “no more.” When it first appeared in our language
    it was used as a noun, with the meaning of “[quandary](/dictionary/quandary).”

- en: By the early 17th century *nonplus* was being used as a verb, with the meaning
    of “to cause to be at a loss as to what to say, think, or do.” Then, as now, the
    word is often encountered in its participial form (*nonplussed*), with a meaning
    that is nearly synonymous with “[perplexed](/dictionary/perplexed).”

    and narrow, avoiding the temptations of demon rum and semantic drift, and as a
    result of this managed to keep its meaning remarkably unchanged. And then in the
    early 20th century some people began to use *nonplus* to mean “unruffled, unconcerned,”
    and ever since then the word just hasn’t been the same.

    although when it was noticed this sense has been categorically rejected as a mistake.
    Mistake it may well be, but the fact remains that this sense of the word is in
    widespread use today, and may be found often enough in well regarded and highly
    edited, publications.
