    used in e-commerce applications, where these tags can select between products,
    for example green or red shoes.

    This can be done using machine learning. But why would you use an algorithm if
    you can label images by hand?

    of labelling becomes cumbersome.

    that instead can be spent on other relevant tasks. In addition, it will take away
    the subjective bias and errors in judging colors. Actually, individual and gender
    differences have been found in the way humans perceive, name and classify colors,
    and there are as well discrepancies in color classification between speakers of
    different languages

    fact a number of conditions that hinder product color classification by machine
    learning.

- en: First, photos have different visual quality such as brightness, contrast and
    saturation. The training set should account for these differences. If the photos
    used for training were taken inside, there is a risk that the model will not recognize
    photos that were taken outside since several conditions  may differ (light, shadow).
    In other words, the testset (or data in production) should mirror those used during
    training.

    furniture etc. depending on the kind of e-commerce shop you run. The question
    is how much product variety a model should account for during color tagging.
  id: totrans-split-17

- en: Third, there is a large diversity of colors that exist in the world and one
    needs to select which classes need to be recognized by the system. For example,
    the principal colors green and blue seem obvious choices but what about the color
    called turquoise that is inbetween green and blue? Therefore, a careful examination
    of the production context is needed.
