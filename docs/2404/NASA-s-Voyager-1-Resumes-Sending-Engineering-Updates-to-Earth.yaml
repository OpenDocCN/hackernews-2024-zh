- en: So they devised a plan to divide the affected code into sections and store those
    sections in different places in the FDS. To make this plan work, they also needed
    to adjust those code sections to ensure, for example, that they all still function
    as a whole. Any references to the location of that code in other parts of the
    FDS memory needed to be updated as well.

    engineering data. They sent it to its new location in the FDS memory on April
    18\. A radio signal takes about 22 ½ hours to reach Voyager 1, which is over 15
    billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and another 22 ½ hours for a
    signal to come back to Earth. When the mission flight team heard back from the
    spacecraft on April 20, they saw that the modification worked: For the first time
    in five months, they have been able to check the health and status of the spacecraft.'
