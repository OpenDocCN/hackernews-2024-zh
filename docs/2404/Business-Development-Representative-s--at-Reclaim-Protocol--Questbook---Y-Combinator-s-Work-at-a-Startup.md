# Business Development Representative(s) at Reclaim Protocol, Questbook | Y Combinator's Work at a Startup

> 来源：[https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs/65710](https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs/65710)

Reclaim Protocol (by Questbook) helps users migrate their profile and reputation from one app to another. Until recently, the rating you have accumulated on Uber or the followers you have on Twitter are locked in the said apps.

Reclaim Protocol uses zeroknowledge-proofs on https traffic to enable migration of profiles.

We've raised about $10M - from top VCs including but not limited to Lemnis Capital, Hashed, Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly, Spartan, Balaji S.

We are about 25 employees. 80% of whom are engineers.

You will enjoy working with us if :

1.  You are an independent operator - the team is fully remote and across timezones. Typically, there is only one person working per project at the company. So, you're expected to make tough decisions on the go with little help from colleagues. Not only make decisions, but also make them fast and execute on it.
2.  You thrive in chaos - the tech we're working on is super cutting edge. There are constant improvements in cryptographic tools available. We have to stay on top of the latest greatest, even if it means not all of us have clarity all the time. The problem statements at the company are often vague and open ended. You are expected to look for clarity, ask questions, do research and eventually come up with a solution. Fast.
3.  If you like exploring the frontiers of technology - everything here is cutting edge. We don't have apps, we have appclips. We don't do cryptography, we do zkproofs. The team is an ultra tech aware one. So, we're always trying to use the super powers of the latest greatest technology out there. That means reading through a lot of shitty documentation and being many times the first to use a certain tech/library.

You will hate working with us if :

1.  You don't like speaking with customers - most companies shield developers from customers and only the "business folks" speak with customers. Not at our company. Every engineer handles one customer. Helping that customer integrate our products and respond to all their queries on telegram around the clock.
2.  You don't like purging code - at the time of this writing, 100% of the code I've written has been purged. Everyone at the company will have an outrageous amount of code that has been trashed. We build fast and trash faster. We experiment a lot. At any point of time there are atleast 3 projects that are in the research phase and might never make it to production. If you're on the project that didn't move the needle, it will be trashed. And there's no room to feel bad about it. It happens all the time.
3.  If you hate documentation - every PR in our core products is accompanied by updating our docs. Our docs is our primary product, the SDK is the manifestation of the docs. If you don't enjoy writing docs, you'll find this place miserable. Not just that, if you feel there are parts of the development stack that are beneath you, you will hate working with us. If you think frontend/backent/devops/documentation is beneath you, this isn't the place for you.
4.  If you love the 80-20 rule - unlike many other products 80-20 isn't good enough. Our customers have a long tail of requirements. Products that satisfy just the top 20% customers will not get us 80% of the revenue. We often have to go over and beyond to serve our customers. We don't settle easy. If you often think "I will skip this and will get away with it", you'd be in the wrong place.

**Skills:** Cryptography, Blockchain

### **Reclaim Protocol**

[ReclaimProtocol.org](http://ReclaimProtocol.org) is a ground-breaking cryptography technology that enables users to generate attestations (aka digital notary) of any of their user data on the web. This leads to new use cases in Identity, verification and trust segments.

Reclaim Protocol helps generate zeroknowledge proofs from https traffic. We operate on the cutting edge of technology.

Interesting tech stack components

*   ZK Circuits on mobile : There are probably no other products with real customers that generate zk proofs on a mobile phone. We relentlessly focus on improving performance. Every second of performance counts. Our customers have phones from 2017 Low end Android devices to the latest iPhone. Our zkproofs need to be generated on all of them. At the time of this writing it takes about 30s to create a proof on the low end Androids. And in somecases, just crashes. ZK Circuits are memory intensive. We're always exploring optimizations and alternate implementations.

*   Appclips & Instant apps - Many of the apps don't need to be apps that need to be downloaded on the appstores. They just need to be an app like experience. To interact with the Reclaim Protocol, we use appclips. Appclips are a feature in phones that are oft overlooked. Making an app that opens instantaneously without having to install a new app by visiting the store unlocks a whole new design space. Ours is an appclip - which means there are strict limits on package size. So, we're not only optimizing the run time of the zkproofs, but we are also trying to optimize the package size at the same time.

*   SDKs : We have SDKs for multiple popular frameworks. This includes NodeJS, ReactJS, React Native, Flutter and a bunch of blockchain SDKs like Ethereum, EVM, Solana, Near, Cosmos, Polkadot etc. The zkproofs can be verified on any framework the app is built on, and we support as many as we can.

*   Developer tooling - we're continuously investing in building great developer tooling. Imagine building the chrome debug tools ground up from scratch. That's what we do. We build developer tools for our customers to see what is happening under the hood on their mobile browser - so as to help them speed up integrating our SDK. This development is full of edge cases and lot of intricacies. We have written our own implementation of TLS ground up. And it's open sourced.

We are extremely proud of the technology we build.
