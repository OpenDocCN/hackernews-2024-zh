    versions of the GNU C Compiler — GCC 1.27 (released in 1988) on a modern system.

    I had started working on this post before Debian 9 was released). I decided to
    use an i386 container (not an amd64 one to save the efforts; I’m sure that everything
    would work out for amd64 too after some dances with paths and symlinks).

    The first available release is version [0.9](https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/old-releases/gcc-1/gcc-0.9.tar.bz2).
    Unfortunately, this release is not very interesting for us, because it does not
    support the i386 architecture (or any compatible one).

    of the GNU C Compiler (notice that back then it was called the GNU C Compiler
    rather than the GNU Compiler Collection) is the first available version that supports
    the i386 architecture. It was released on 05.09.1988 (Linux did not exist back
    then).

    and configuration is done manually. Nevertheless, it is very straightforward and
    well documented. In fact, it involves creating just 4 symlinks.

    toolchain. Furthermore, essential Glibc headers are also backwards compatible
    with old compilers. Owing to this fact it is possible to compile GCC 1.27 using
    a modern compiler after patching only a dozen (out of ~92000) lines of code. Most
    of them are related to changes in the C library, and some are due to more strict
    C syntax rules implemented in modern C compilers (see [gcc-1.27.patch](https://gist.github.com/miyuki/9eab2c6a43e23c95183eb39e1f5e6833)).

    some constants used for generating debug information in the SDB format. It is
    unsurprising that the header is missing: on Linux SDB was superseded by the DWARF
    format a long ago. I managed to find these headers on the MIT website: [syms.h](http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/athena/system/rs_aix32/os/usr/include/syms.h).
    The URL suggests that these files have something to do with the IBM AIX OS.'

    compiler. As you probably know, the GNU toolchain includes other tools, such as
    an assembler and a linker with which the compiler interacts. Luckily, the syntax
    of generated assembly code is fully compatible with a contemporary version of
    the GNU assembler (except for debug information). As for the linker, some tweaks
    to the so-called linker specs (i.e. command line options used by the GCC driver)
    were needed.

    files (i.e., `config-i386v.h` is used on i386 System V, and `config-sparc.h` is
    used on Sparc Sun). Machine description `.md` files describe CPU instruction patterns.
    During the build stage, they are parsed and transformed into C source files, which
    later get linked with the compiler. Of course, during the past decades the DSL
    of `.md` has evolved, but the principle remains the same. Furthermore, the LLVM
    compiler infrastructure [uses](http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html#using-tablegen-for-target-description)
    a similar technique.

    and enhancement requests was kept in a file called `PROBLEMS`. As of version 1.27
    it contains 27 entries with many gaps in numbering. Actually, the last item has
    number 122\. This probably means that the remaining 95 problems had been fixed
    before this release.
