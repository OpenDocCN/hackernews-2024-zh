    had a problem. Jerry Dischler, then the VP and General Manager of Ads at Google,
    and Shiv Venkataraman, then the VP of Engineering, Search and Ads on Google properties,
    [had called a “code yellow” for search revenue](https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&ref=wheresyoured.at)

- en: For those unfamiliar with Google’s internal scientology-esque jargon, let me
    explain. A “code yellow” isn’t, as you might think, a crisis of moderate severity.
    The yellow, according to Steven Levy’s tell-all book about Google, refers to —
    and I promise that I’m not making this up — the [color of a tank top that former
    VP of Engineering Wayne Rosing used to wear during his time at the company](https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    It’s essentially the equivalent of DEFCON 1 and activates, as Levy explained,
    a war room-like situation where workers are pulled from their desks and into a
    conference room where they tackle the problem as a top priority. Any other projects
    or concerns are sidelined.

  zh: 对于不熟悉Google内部术语的人，让我来解释一下。“代码黄色”并不像你想象的那样是一种中度危机。据Steven Levy关于Google的爆料书籍透露，黄色指的是——我保证这不是编造——前工程副总裁Wayne
    Rosing在公司期间穿过的一种背心的颜色，详情请见[他的这篇文章](https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at)。这基本上相当于DEFCON
    1，会启动一个类似战争情报室的环境，员工被从他们的工作台上抽调，进入一个会议室，将问题作为头等优先解决。任何其他项目或关注点都会被搁置。
- en: In emails released as part of the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against
    Google, Dischler laid out several contributing factors — search query growth was
    “significantly behind forecast,” the “timing” of revenue launches was significantly
    behind, and a vague worry that “several advertiser-specific and sector weaknesses”
    existed in search.

- en: I should note that I’ve previously — and erroneously — referred to the “code
    yellow” as something that Gomes raised as a means of calling attention to the
    proximity of Google’s ads side getting too close to search. The truth is much
    grimmer — the Code Yellow was the rumble of the Rot Economy, with Google’s revenue
    arm sounding the alarm that its golden goose wasn’t laying enough eggs. Gomes,
    a Googler of 19 years that built the foundation of modern search engines, should
    go down as one of the few people in tech that actually fought for a real principle,
    destroyed by and replaced with Prabhakar Raghavan, a computer scientist class
    traitor that sided with the management consultancy sect. More confusingly, one
    of the problems was that there was insufficient growth in “queries,” as in the
    amount of things people were asking Google. It’s a bit like if Ford decided that
    things were going poorly because drivers weren’t putting enough miles on their
    trucks.

    with Nick Fox, a Vice President of Search and Google Assistant, entering a multiple-day-long
    debate about Google’s sudden lust for growth. The thread is a dark window into
    the world of growth-focused tech, where Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection
    between the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team wasn’t able to
    finely optimize engagement on Google without “hacking engagement,” a term that
    means effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that doing
    so would lead them to “abandon work on efficient journeys.” In one email, Fox

    in a long email, he explained how one might increase engagement with Google Search,
    but specifically added that they could “increase queries quite easily in the short
    term in user negative ways,” like turning off spell correction, turning off ranking
    improvements, or placing refinements — effectively labels — all over the page,
    adding that it was “possible that there are trade offs here between different
    kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking,” and that he was “deeply
    deeply uncomfortable with this.” He also added that this was the reason he didn’t

    decided to pivot into web 2.0 and original content, making some bets that paid
    off, but far, far too many that didn’t. [It spent $1.1bn on Tumblr in 2013, only
    for Verizon to sell it for just $3m in 2019](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    It bought Zimbra in 2007, ostensibly to compete with the new Google Apps productivity
    suite, [only to sell it (for a reported fraction of the original purchase price)
    to VMware a few years later](https://www.cnet.com/culture/yahoo-sells-zimbra-to-vmware/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    Yahoo was a company without a mission, purpose, or objective. Nobody — and, I’ll
    speculate, even those leading the company — really knew what it was, or what it
    did.

    Raghavan spoke of his intent to “align the commercial incentives of a billion
    content providers with social good intent” while at Yahoo, and his eagerness to
    “inspire the audience to give more data. Before that, it’s hard to find out exactly
    what Raghavan did — according to ZDNet, he spent “14 years doing search and data-mining
    research at IBM.”'

    that called him “Yahoo’s secret weapon,” describing his plan to make “rigorous
    scientific research and practice… to inform Yahoo's business from email to advertising,”
    and how under then-CEO Carol Bartz, “the focus has shifted to the direct development
    of new products.” It speaks of Raghavan’s “scientific approach” and his “steady,
    process-based logic to innovation that is very different to the common perception
    that ideas and development are more about luck and spontaneity,” a sentence I
    am only sharing with you because I need you to see how stupid it is, and how specious
    the tech press’ accolades used to be. This entire article is ridiculous, so utterly
    vacuous that I’m actually astonished. What about Raghavan’s career made this feel
    right? How has nobody connected these dots before and said something? Am I insane?

    Bartz, [was still angry about for years](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/microsoft-search-deal-hasnt-worked-out-as-mayer-hoped/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    Raghavan’s reign as the “[search master](https://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/yahoos-new-search-master/1674?ref=wheresyoured.at)”
    was one so successful that it ended up being replaced by a search engine that

    that involved firing entire divisions-worth of people, and four months before
    Carol Bartz would be fired by telephone by then-Chairman Roy Bostock. Her replacement

    five months in the role before he too was [replaced by former Google executive
    Marissa Mayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18053577?ref=wheresyoured.at),

    —— 曾担任PayPal总裁的斯科特·汤普森 —— 在这个角色上只坚持了五个月，之后也被前谷歌高管玛丽莎·梅耶取代，部分原因是因为他谎称拥有计算机科学学位。
- en: Bartz joined Yahoo in 2009 in the aftermath of its previous CEO Jerry Yang refusing
    to sell the company to Microsoft for $45 billion. In her first year, she laid
    off hundreds of people and struck a deal to power Yahoo’s search using Microsoft’s
    Bing search engine tech, with [Microsoft paying Yahoo 88% of the revenue it gained
    from searches](https://money.cnn.com/2009/07/29/technology/microsoft_yahoo/?ref=wheresyoured.at)
    — a deal that made Yahoo a couple hundred million dollars for handing over the
    keys to its most high-traffic platform.

    —— 这笔交易让雅虎因交出其最高流量平台的控制权而赚得了几亿美元。
- en: As I have previously stated, when Prabhakar Ragahavan, Yahoo’s secret weapon,
    was doing his work, Yahoo Search was so valuable it was replaced with Bing. The
    company’s sole value, in many ways, was entirely driven by nostalgia and the association
    with the days before he worked there.

- en: It’s very, very difficult to find much on Raghavan’s history — it took me hours
    of digging through Google results to find the three or four articles that went
    into any depth about him — but from what I’ve gleaned, his expertise lies primarily
    in “failing up,” ascending through the ranks of technology on the momentum from
    the explosions he caused. In a WIRED interview from 2021, Steven Levy said Raghavan
    “[isn’t CEO of Google— he just runs the place](https://www.wired.com/story/prabhakar-raghavan-isnt-ceo-of-google-he-just-runs-the-place/?ref=wheresyoured.at),”
    and described his addition to the company as “a move from research to management.”

  zh: 他的历史记录中很难找到很多关于拉加万的资料 —— 我花了数小时浏览谷歌搜索结果，才找到三四篇深度报道他的文章 —— 但据我了解，他的专长主要在于“失败中成功”，凭借引起轰动的爆炸性事件在科技界逐级晋升。在2021年《WIRED》的一次采访中，史蒂文·莱维称拉加万“并非谷歌的CEO
    —— 他只是管理这个地方”，并描述他加入公司是“从研究转向管理”。
- en: While Levy calls him a “world-class computer scientist who has authored definitive
    texts in the field,” he also describes Raghavan as “choosing a management track,”
    which definitely tracks with everything I’ve found about him. Raghavan proudly
    declares that “Google’s third-party ad tech plays a critical role in keeping journalism
    alive” at a time when he was aggressively incentivizing search engine optimized
    content, and a year after he’d deposed someone who actually gave a shit about
    search.

    Google CEO Sundar Pichai) deserve as much criticism, if not more, for the damage
    they’ve done to society. Because Google is the ultimate essential piece of online
    infrastructure, just like power lines and water mains are in the physical realm.

    more than 200 million dollars a year.

    a manager by trade — is an example of everything wrong with the tech industry.
    Despite his history as a true computer scientist with actual academic credentials,
    Raghavan chose to bulldoze actual workers and replace them with toadies that would
    make Google more profitable and less useful to the world at large.

    it. Larry Page and Sergey Brin left Google in December 2019 (the same year as
    the Code Yellow fiasco), and while they remain as controlling shareholders, they
    clearly don’t give a shit about what “Google” means anymore. Prabhakar Raghavan
    is a manager, and his career, from what I can tell, is mostly made up of “did
    some stuff at IBM, failed to make Yahoo anything of note, and fucked up Google
    so badly that every news outlet has run a story about how bad it is.”

    to profit as much as possible, you only care about growth. You’re not a user,
    you’re a parasite, and it’s these parasites that have dominated and are draining
    the tech industry of its value.

    if we’re being exceptionally charitable, failed to avoid in the case of Yahoo)
    on two industry-defining companies, and the fact that he did it without being
    a CEO or founder. Perhaps more remarkable, he’s achieved this while maintaining
    a certain degree of anonymity. Everyone knows who Musk and Zuckerberg are, but
    Raghavan’s known only in his corner of the Internet. Or at least he was.
