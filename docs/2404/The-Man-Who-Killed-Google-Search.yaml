    and Shiv Venkataraman, then the VP of Engineering, Search and Ads on Google properties,
    [had called a “code yellow” for search revenue](https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&ref=wheresyoured.at)

    Venkataraman，[由于“每日数据稳定下降”，并且可能会导致季度末大幅落后，宣布了“代码黄色警报”](https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&ref=wheresyoured.at)。
- en: For those unfamiliar with Google’s internal scientology-esque jargon, let me
    explain. A “code yellow” isn’t, as you might think, a crisis of moderate severity.
    The yellow, according to Steven Levy’s tell-all book about Google, refers to —
    and I promise that I’m not making this up — the [color of a tank top that former
    VP of Engineering Wayne Rosing used to wear during his time at the company](https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    It’s essentially the equivalent of DEFCON 1 and activates, as Levy explained,
    a war room-like situation where workers are pulled from their desks and into a
    conference room where they tackle the problem as a top priority. Any other projects
    or concerns are sidelined.

  zh: 对于不熟悉Google内部术语的人，让我来解释一下。“代码黄色”并不像你想象的那样是一种中度危机。据Steven Levy关于Google的爆料书籍透露，黄色指的是——我保证这不是编造——前工程副总裁Wayne
    Rosing在公司期间穿过的一种背心的颜色，详情请见[他的这篇文章](https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at)。这基本上相当于DEFCON
    1，会启动一个类似战争情报室的环境，员工被从他们的工作台上抽调，进入一个会议室，将问题作为头等优先解决。任何其他项目或关注点都会被搁置。
- en: In emails released as part of the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against
    Google, Dischler laid out several contributing factors — search query growth was
    “significantly behind forecast,” the “timing” of revenue launches was significantly
    behind, and a vague worry that “several advertiser-specific and sector weaknesses”
    existed in search.

  zh: 在美国司法部反垄断谷歌的案件中公开的电子邮件中，Dischler列出了几个影响因素——搜索查询增长“显著落后于预测”，收入发布的“时间”显著滞后，以及“存在几个广告商特定和行业的弱点”引发了一种模糊的担忧。
- en: I should note that I’ve previously — and erroneously — referred to the “code
    yellow” as something that Gomes raised as a means of calling attention to the
    proximity of Google’s ads side getting too close to search. The truth is much
    grimmer — the Code Yellow was the rumble of the Rot Economy, with Google’s revenue
    arm sounding the alarm that its golden goose wasn’t laying enough eggs. Gomes,
    a Googler of 19 years that built the foundation of modern search engines, should
    go down as one of the few people in tech that actually fought for a real principle,
    destroyed by and replaced with Prabhakar Raghavan, a computer scientist class
    traitor that sided with the management consultancy sect. More confusingly, one
    of the problems was that there was insufficient growth in “queries,” as in the
    amount of things people were asking Google. It’s a bit like if Ford decided that
    things were going poorly because drivers weren’t putting enough miles on their
    trucks.

  zh: 我应该指出，我之前错误地将“代码黄色”称为戈麦斯提出的某种方式，目的是提醒谷歌广告部门接近搜索的距离。事实要严峻得多——代码黄色是经济腐败的隐喻，谷歌的收入部门警示其摇钱树未能产卵。戈麦斯是一位19年的谷歌员工，奠定了现代搜索引擎的基础，他应该成为少数在科技界真正为原则而战的人之一，但被普拉巴卡尔·拉格哈万取代，他是一位与管理咨询部门同流合污的计算机科学家叛徒。更令人困惑的是，其中一个问题是“查询”增长不足，即人们向谷歌提问的数量不足。这有点像福特决定事情进展不顺利，因为驾驶员没有给他们的卡车跑足够的英里。

    VP Business Finance Officer, had emailed Shashi Thakur, then Google’s VP of Engineering,

    vaguely referring to how critical that growth was to an unnamed “company plan.”

    with Nick Fox, a Vice President of Search and Google Assistant, entering a multiple-day-long
    debate about Google’s sudden lust for growth. The thread is a dark window into
    the world of growth-focused tech, where Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection
    between the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team wasn’t able to
    finely optimize engagement on Google without “hacking engagement,” a term that
    means effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that doing

    term in user negative ways,” like turning off spell correction, turning off ranking
    improvements, or placing refinements — effectively labels — all over the page,
    adding that it was “possible that there are trade offs here between different
    kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking,” and that he was “deeply
    deeply uncomfortable with this.” He also added that this was the reason he didn’t

    Gomes framed Google’s challenge as “taking [the PageRank algorithm] from one machine
    to a whole bunch of machines, and they weren’t very good machines at the time.”
    Despite his impact and tenure, Gomes had only been made Head of Search in the
    middle of 2018 after John Giannandrea moved to Apple to work on its machine learning
    and AI strategy. Gomes had been described as Google’s “search czar,” beloved for
