    killing it.

- en: The story begins on February 5th 2019, when Ben Gomes, Google’s head of search,
    had a problem. Jerry Dischler, then the VP and General Manager of Ads at Google,
    and Shiv Venkataraman, then the VP of Engineering, Search and Ads on Google properties,
    [had called a “code yellow” for search revenue](https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&ref=wheresyoured.at)
    due to, and I quote, “steady weakness in the daily numbers” and a likeliness that
    it would end the quarter significantly behind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those unfamiliar with Google’s internal scientology-esque jargon, let me
    explain. A “code yellow” isn’t, as you might think, a crisis of moderate severity.
    The yellow, according to Steven Levy’s tell-all book about Google, refers to —
    and I promise that I’m not making this up — the [color of a tank top that former
    VP of Engineering Wayne Rosing used to wear during his time at the company](https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at).
    It’s essentially the equivalent of DEFCON 1 and activates, as Levy explained,
    a war room-like situation where workers are pulled from their desks and into a
    conference room where they tackle the problem as a top priority. Any other projects
    or concerns are sidelined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In emails released as part of the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against
    Google, Dischler laid out several contributing factors — search query growth was
    “significantly behind forecast,” the “timing” of revenue launches was significantly
    behind, and a vague worry that “several advertiser-specific and sector weaknesses”
    existed in search.

- en: I should note that I’ve previously — and erroneously — referred to the “code
    yellow” as something that Gomes raised as a means of calling attention to the
    proximity of Google’s ads side getting too close to search. The truth is much
    grimmer — the Code Yellow was the rumble of the Rot Economy, with Google’s revenue
    arm sounding the alarm that its golden goose wasn’t laying enough eggs. Gomes,
    a Googler of 19 years that built the foundation of modern search engines, should
    go down as one of the few people in tech that actually fought for a real principle,
    destroyed by and replaced with Prabhakar Raghavan, a computer scientist class
    traitor that sided with the management consultancy sect. More confusingly, one
    of the problems was that there was insufficient growth in “queries,” as in the
    amount of things people were asking Google. It’s a bit like if Ford decided that
    things were going poorly because drivers weren’t putting enough miles on their
    trucks.

    to “close the search gap [it was] seeing,”](https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417581.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at)

    the world of growth-focused tech, where Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection
    between the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team wasn’t able to
    finely optimize engagement on Google without “hacking engagement,” a term that
    means effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that doing
    so would lead them to “abandon work on efficient journeys.” In one email, Fox
    adds that there was a “pretty big disconnect between what finance and ads want”
    and what search was doing.

    He led by saying he was “annoyed both personally and on behalf of the search team.”
    in a long email, he explained how one might increase engagement with Google Search,
    but specifically added that they could “increase queries quite easily in the short
    term in user negative ways,” like turning off spell correction, turning off ranking
    improvements, or placing refinements — effectively labels — all over the page,
    adding that it was “possible that there are trade offs here between different
    kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking,” and that he was “deeply
    deeply uncomfortable with this.” He also added that this was the reason he didn’t
    believe that queries were a good metric to measure search and that the best defense
    about the weakness of queries was to create “compelling user experiences that
    make users want to come back.”

    it. Larry Page and Sergey Brin left Google in December 2019 (the same year as
    the Code Yellow fiasco), and while they remain as controlling shareholders, they
    clearly don’t give a shit about what “Google” means anymore. Prabhakar Raghavan
    is a manager, and his career, from what I can tell, is mostly made up of “did
    some stuff at IBM, failed to make Yahoo anything of note, and fucked up Google
    so badly that every news outlet has run a story about how bad it is.”

    handing it to managers at a time when “management” is synonymous with “staying
    as far away from actual work as possible.” And when you’re a do-nothing looking
    to profit as much as possible, you only care about growth. You’re not a user,
    you’re a parasite, and it’s these parasites that have dominated and are draining
    the tech industry of its value.

    if we’re being exceptionally charitable, failed to avoid in the case of Yahoo)
    on two industry-defining companies, and the fact that he did it without being
    a CEO or founder. Perhaps more remarkable, he’s achieved this while maintaining
    a certain degree of anonymity. Everyone knows who Musk and Zuckerberg are, but
    Raghavan’s known only in his corner of the Internet. Or at least he was.

    is one with less resources and less time to deliver things. Rot Master Raghavan
    is here to squeeze as much as he can from the corpse of a product he beat to death
    with his bare hands.

    that have caused immeasurable damage to the Internet in the name of growth and
    “shareholder value." And I believe these uber-managers - these ultra-pencil-pushers
    and growth-hounds - are the forces destroying tech's ability to innovate.

    kind of managerial mindset has poisoned Silicon Valley, making career failures
    unfathomably rich while your favorite tech products decay.
