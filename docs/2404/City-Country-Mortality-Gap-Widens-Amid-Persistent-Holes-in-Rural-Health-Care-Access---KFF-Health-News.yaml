    from the Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service found the chasm
    has grown in recent decades. In their examination, USDA researchers found rural
    Americans from the ages of 25 to 54 die from natural causes, like chronic diseases
    and cancer, at wildly higher rates than the same age group living in urban areas.
    The analysis did not include external causes of death, such as suicide or accidental

    of women living in rural places who succumb young to treatable or preventable
    diseases. In the most rural places, counties without an urban core population
