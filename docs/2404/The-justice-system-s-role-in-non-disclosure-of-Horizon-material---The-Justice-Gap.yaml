    the law relating to the admissibility of computer generated evidence. In 1984

- en: In 1999 these provisions were repealed. Reports in the media stated a presumption
    was introduced into law on how courts should consider electronic evidence. The
    new rule introduced in 1999 followed a Law Commission recommendation for courts

  zh: 1999年，这些条款被废除。媒体报道称，法律引入了一种假设，规定法院应如何考虑电子证据。1999年引入的新规则是根据法律委员会的建议，法院应假定计算机系统在没有明确证据反对的情况下操作正确（Karl
    Flinders，《计算机周刊》，2021年1月20日）。
- en: 'Alex Hern, writing in the *Guardian* (12 January 2024), quoted Stephen Mason,
    a barrister and expert on electronic evidence, who said: ‘It says, for the person
    who’s saying “there’s something wrong with this computer”, that they have to prove
    it. Even if it’s the person accusing them who has the information.’ Is this a
    correct interpretation of the law? The Crown Prosecution Service’s online legal
    guidance (always an authoritative and useful source) states that since the 1999
    change in the law, computer evidence must follow the common law rule, that a presumption
    will exist that the computer producing the evidential record was working properly
    at the material time and that the record is therefore admissible as real evidence.'

    这是对法律的正确解释吗？ 英国皇家检察署的在线法律指导（总是权威和有用的来源）指出，自1999年法律变更以来，计算机证据必须遵循普通法规则，即假定生成证据记录的计算机在相关时间段内正常运行，因此这些记录是可作为真实证据提交的。

    But common law admissibility rules include rebuttal provisions, the CPS reminds

    seeking to produce the computer record in evidence to satisfy the court that the

    is prosecuted for committing a violent crime on the basis of identification evidence,

    it was the defence’s responsibility to prove otherwise, and the defence had not
    produced any evidence to show that Horizon had major and relevant faults. The
    defence was excluded from PII hearings, so they were not able to argue against

    appeal courts being forced to admit evidence which had been concealed by other

    it. In an investigation following the rules laid down in the CPIA 1996 and its
