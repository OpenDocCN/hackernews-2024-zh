    kitchen. That said, they didn’t always get used. “My mom taught me in a more ‘old
    world’ way,” she says – measuring the water to cover rice with one of her knuckles,
    for instance. Nosrat, the author of cookbook [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/15/californian-recipes-samin-nosrat-broad-bean-mint-pasta-artichokes-sweetcorn-soup-herb-salsa-green-goddess)
    and presenter of the Netflix show with the same name, has built a career on what
    she calls “sensory-guided cooking” – helping home cooks to build culinary instincts
    by understanding how ingredients behave – and so admits to having “a somewhat
    tortured relationship with measurements”. But as a recipe writer, she describes
    herself as “neurotic”. “If I’m going to write recipes which are clear and which
    work,” says Nosrat, “it just makes sense to use scales. I have three sets.”

- en: There is a chasm between Europe and America’s kitchen cultures. The fundamental
    difference is that Americans use volume, not weight, to make measurements in their
    kitchens. Cooking with cups is volume-based and relies heavily on visual cues
    – everyone knows what a cup of granulated sugar looks like; less so 200g or 7.1oz
    – while the metric system is weight-based. “The issue isn’t that Americans weigh
    things differently,” says Sarah Chamberlain, a writer who Americanises British
    cookbooks for the US market. “It’s that most of them don’t weigh things at all.”

    written five cookbooks and for years has been banging a drum for her American
    readers to invest in scales; her own mother has only just bought a set more than
    20 years into her daughter’s career as a professional baker.

    insist on the cup system when the rest of the world cooks in another way.” She
    likens the conversion between cups and metric measurements to translation, “but
    not one that needs to be there. Actual languages are intrinsic to cultures and
    date back thousands of years. But [the language of cups] is just so arbitrary.”

    [Baking](https://www.theguardian.com/food/baking) pros and Europeans can fly the
    flag for using scales and the metric system all they like, but what if people
    just like using their cups? Critiques of the cup volume system can strike at something
    elemental – tribal, even – in American cooks. As Chamberlain says: “It’s telling
    someone the thing they first got programmed to do was wrong.” Add to that the
    fact that sets of cup measures sometimes get handed down through generations,
    and that many people learned to cook this way from now-absent family members,

    things using the metric system, “because the numbers multiply and divide more
    easily”. Food professionals seem universally to prefer grams and milligrams to
    cups for their accuracy. Celebrated American baker and author of 14 cookbooks
    [Dorie Greenspan](https://doriegreenspan.com/) now develops all her recipes in
    metric, which a tester then calculates in cups; the resulting books are published
    with dual measurements. Greenspan says it took a lot to convince her publishers
    to do this: “They were worried American readers would find the metric measurements
    intimidating.” Nosrat, meanwhile, has been known to pack a digital scale in her
    suitcase when travelling.'

- en: Cups are thorny territory for anyone who edits recipes for audiences on both
    sides of this transatlantic divide. The conversion to a metric (or any) weight
    depends on almost countless variables, from the ingredient you are measuring (a
    cup of flour weighs much less than a cup of brown sugar, for example) – but also
    within ingredient categories (a cup of unrefined brown sugar is heavier than,
    say, one of caster [superfine] sugar) – to how tightly or loosely you pack an
    ingredient into a cup. It also depends on your own particular set of cups; Chamberlain’s
    are beautifully rounded and smooth – it’s easy to empty them – but, she says,
    “getting stuff out of the bottom edges of a cylindrical cup is a pain in the ass”.

    “headache” are universally applied to flour. According to Greenspan, “you can
    weigh a cup of flour 10 times and get a different measurement – there are different
    types of flour, but also the flour might be old, or dry, or there might have been
    humidity. I always aerate the flour bin, then scoop and sweep [or level it off].
    My cup of flour is 136g. King Arthur Baking makes it 120g. Some others go as high
    as 150g.” This kind of discrepancy makes for wildly varied results, not least
    if you scale up a recipe by, say, four. “A couple of grams’ difference doesn’t
    change much in a single batch,” Ptak says, but if you’re quadrupling a recipe,
    a small difference in the definition of cup volume becomes very significant. As
    Lara Hamilton, owner of Book Larder, a culinary bookstore in Seattle, puts it:
    “This can be the difference between a moist, fluffy cake and a dry, dense one.”'

    explains, they are hard to judge: they’re light and can include stems, leaves
    or both. Measuring sticky things is annoying in cups, too, she says: “Peanut butter,
    molasses, honey … The trick is to oil your cup before you add the sticky thing.
    And this is where grams are good: you can just dump the sticky thing in a bowl
    on the scales.” And, of course, you save on washing-up. “If you used a cup for
    molasses which you then need to use for flour,” says Nosrat, “you have to stop
    everything to wash it. Scales make me so much saner!”'

    romantic but cumbersome. I remember the day Mum bought digital scales and how
    they changed the game – suddenly, we could measure all our dry ingredients in
    one bowl, the wet in another, combine the two and there was a cake in the oven
    in minutes. Most people who have acquired digital scales do not look back, it
    seems. As Greenspan says: “I no longer know what the benefit of cups is, other
    than comfort – if that’s how you learned or how your mother or grandmother did

    Berkeley institution [Chez Panisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chez_Panisse)
    until 2005, says it was only around that time that the restaurant stopped using
    cups for all their desserts. She left Chez Panisse for London, where, she says,
    it was rare for restaurants to have a dedicated pastry chef. Their increased recognition
    in kitchens – the [River Cafe](https://www.rivercafe.co.uk/) went from having
    no one dedicated to pastry when Ptak worked there to about 20 people in the section
    now – dovetailed with the surge in popularity of cupcakes and home baking thanks
    to the likes of [Sex in the City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-58805215)
    and then, in 2010, [The Great British Bake Off](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/)
    (AKA The Great British Baking Show in the US). Suddenly, sales of stand mixers
    and cupcake trays and, yes, digital scales surged.

    a recipe accurately, which means using scales!”

    As a UK publication with a global audience, and a predominantly British roster

    say, 500g courgettes (zucchini) to three medium ones. And, for smaller measurements,
    we follow the American model, preferring a teaspoon to 6g salt or a tablespoon
    to 20g maple syrup. Still, Simmons says that the “one lemon”, “a handful of parsley”
    and “a good pinch of salt” she sees in our recipes are “much more casual than
    an American recipe”.
