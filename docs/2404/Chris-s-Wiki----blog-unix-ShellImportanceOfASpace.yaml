    I (originally) made a Unix command line mistake by unthinkingly leaving out an
    ordinary, innocent looking space (it's corrected in the current version of the
    entry after it was noted by Emilio in a comment). This innocent looking mistake
    and its consequences are an illustration of something in Unix shell command lines,
    although I'm not sure of just what, so I'm going to write it up.

    is taken as the 'line' terminator, but if *delim* is blank, `read` will terminate
    the line when it reads a NUL character (0 byte), which is just what you want to
    handle the output of, for example, 'find ... -print0'.

    added by the shell, and programs don''t actually see the ''''s. If you put a ''''
    next to other non-whitespace characters, it disappears in the command line that
