- en: I grew up writing Z80 assembler code during the 8bit era. I wrote some games.
    I wrote assembler 68000 during the Amiga demo scene days. I wrote IRC bots in
    C with the arrival of the internet. I wrote HTML by hand when the web was invented.
    I wrote CGI Perl scripts. I rode the Java hype. I founded some startups. I created
    successful open source projects. I dived into XP. I became a certified Scrum Master.
    I thought functional programming was the next big thing. I fought Rusts borrow
    a checker on the shoulder of Orion. I finished [a book recently](https://ctobook.dev/)
    I write Go code daily, and I work on my [next startup](https://www.inkmi.com/).

    of creating something out of nothing. The logical and puzzle challenges of coding.
    AI will blow all that away. The end of software engineering is near, and I feel
    too old to climb that hill. This hill is for others to climb. Perhaps it is their
    first hill.
