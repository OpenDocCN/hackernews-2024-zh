- en: I grew up writing Z80 assembler code during the 8bit era. I wrote some games.
    I wrote assembler 68000 during the Amiga demo scene days. I wrote IRC bots in
    C with the arrival of the internet. I wrote HTML by hand when the web was invented.
    I wrote CGI Perl scripts. I rode the Java hype. I founded some startups. I created
    successful open source projects. I dived into XP. I became a certified Scrum Master.
    I thought functional programming was the next big thing. I fought Rusts borrow
    a checker on the shoulder of Orion. I finished [a book recently](https://ctobook.dev/)
    I write Go code daily, and I work on my [next startup](https://www.inkmi.com/).

    locomotives and their types. I’m a daily user of AI to let it write code for me.

    of creating something out of nothing. The logical and puzzle challenges of coding.
    AI will blow all that away. The end of software engineering is near, and I feel
    too old to climb that hill. This hill is for others to climb. Perhaps it is their
    first hill.
