- en: With an increasing number of users, there should be an increasing number of
    test cases. By adding new test cases for new features and new bugfixes, over time
    there are many tests and the acts of doing another release or changing internals
    become less dangerous. The test cases combined with many releases over a longer
    time, can slowly build up a trust-level that the basics work. Doing subsequent
    releases is then less of a nerve-wracking thing. Adding another billion users
    should be fine. No need to worry.

- en: Most bugs can be worked around and users can usually even downgrade to an older
    version in many cases in case of need. The fact that a user is having problems
    with your code is rarely a reason for you to stress out, even if that user has
    a known brand associated with it. Even if that user seems to be upset or acts
    aggressively.

    take it calm. The code is Open Source, your job – even as a maintainer – is primarily
    to aid your users to debug the problem.

- en: The code is provided as-is without any warranty. Even the people who are loudest,
    shout the most or use the foulest language know this. Users who cannot follow
    the code of conduct should be banned and ignored at once. For users who are annoying
    but not over the line bad, I try hard to extract their actual technical arguments
    in my mind and talk about those without being misled by insinuations and other
    bad manners. Also, for my own sanity I tend to "rate-limit" people I find hard
    to work with; as long as they are rude I respond with longer and longer intervals.

    while feeling upset or angry. It is then better to wait, sleep on it and go back
    and edit it down to the bare minimum the day after.

    that is a challenge in itself, for me I think "real life" as in having a family
    with wife and kids and other spare time activities also has served as a healthy
    "opposite" to my Open Source activities.

- en: Spending all time, all days on Open Source eventually make me lose interest
    and energy. I need distraction and variation in my days so spending time away
    from the code with my family is not a waste of Open Source time, it is rather
    recharging time and a necessary break that allows me to come back with more energy
    and better ideas.
