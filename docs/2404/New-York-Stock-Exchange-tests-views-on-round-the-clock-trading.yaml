    part of Intercontinental Exchange, was put out by its data analytics team rather
    than its management, but it highlights the growing interest in trading the likes
    of Nvidia or Apple overnight between 8pm and 4am Eastern time.

    markets, including US Treasuries, major currencies and leading stock index futures,
    can be traded around the clock from Monday to Friday.

    [24-hour weekday access to US stocks](https://www.ft.com/content/8b9ad19e-5b17-4b42-9e2a-4d11ddc12eb9)

    pool” trading venue such as Blue Ocean, where shares are often traded with Asian

    perceived because of its heavy regulatory oversight compared with dark pools.
    Exchanges are directly supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
    tested for their stability and security as well as needing approval to alter any
    rules.

    record — of trading prices, meaning night-time activity would be more likely to

    should take place at weekends as well as through a five-day week, how investors
    should be protected from price swings, and how respondents would staff any overnight
    session.

    fund, is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange. The
    filing is the second attempt for 24X, which withdrew a proposal last year over
    operational and technical issues.

    The SEC has several months to scrutinise the plans.

    or not,” said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University, who filed
    a letter supporting 24X’s plan.

    to two sources, to examine the issues involved in shifting to 24-hour trading
    — including who should bear the costs. Clearing houses, which help settle trades,
    also operate within set hours.

    poor liquidity on offer and concerns around settlement risk, among other issues.

    where they state the price at which they would buy or sell. If that is not met,

    Apple at 2am or even 4pm on a Saturday. What do you do then?”
