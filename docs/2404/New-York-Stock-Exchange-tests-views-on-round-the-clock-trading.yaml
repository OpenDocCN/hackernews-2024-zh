    part of Intercontinental Exchange, was put out by its data analytics team rather

  zh: 纽约证券交易所的调查由其数据分析团队而非管理层发布，但它突显了夜间交易诸如Nvidia或Apple的日益增长的兴趣。

    spurred by coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.

  zh: 这个问题近年来成为一个热门话题，部分原因是由于加密货币交易的全天候运作和首次受到冠状病毒大流行封锁刺激的零售投资者活动的增加。

  zh: 在其他大型市场如美国国债、主要货币和主要股指期货可以从周一到周五全天候交易的世界中，证券交易所已经成为了一个落后者。

    [24-hour weekday access to US stocks](https://www.ft.com/content/8b9ad19e-5b17-4b42-9e2a-4d11ddc12eb9)

    pool” trading venue such as Blue Ocean, where shares are often traded with Asian
    retail investors in their daytime.

  zh: 几家零售经纪商，包括Robinhood和Interactive Brokers，现在提供每周工作日全天候访问美国股票的服务，交易可以通过匹配其内部持仓或通过“暗池”交易场所（例如Blue
    Ocean）进行，该平台通常与亚洲零售投资者在白天交易股票。
- en: An overnight exchange, however, would be a step-change in how late trading is
    perceived because of its heavy regulatory oversight compared with dark pools.
    Exchanges are directly supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission and
    tested for their stability and security as well as needing approval to alter any
    rules.

  zh: 然而，夜间交易所的建立将是对晚间交易看法的一次重大改变，因为它与暗池相比具有更严格的监管监督。交易所受到证券交易委员会的直接监督，需经过稳定性和安全性测试，并且需要批准修改任何规则。
- en: Trades on exchanges also form part of the consolidated “tape” — the official
    record — of trading prices, meaning night-time activity would be more likely to
    set the early tone for regular hours trading.

    should take place at weekends as well as through a five-day week, how investors
    should be protected from price swings, and how respondents would staff any overnight
    session.

    trading would be better spent on regular market hour trading”.

    fund, is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange. The
    filing is the second attempt for 24X, which withdrew a proposal last year over

    a letter supporting 24X’s plan.
