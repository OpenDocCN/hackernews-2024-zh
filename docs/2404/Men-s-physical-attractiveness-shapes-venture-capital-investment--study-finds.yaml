- en: Have you ever wondered if being attractive gives entrepreneurs an edge in securing
    venture capital funding? A new study led by [Marc D. Bahlmann](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/marc-d-bahlmann)
    of VU University Amsterdam sheds light on this intriguing question, revealing
    that the physical attractiveness of male entrepreneurs and venture capitalists
    significantly impacts financial decision-making in the high-stakes world of venture
    capital investment. This research uncovers the subtle yet powerful influence of
    looks in determining the flow of millions of euros within the European Information
    Technology (IT) industry.

    of risk-taking behaviors, particularly in the context of innovation and venture
    capital funding. “Recently, I’ve become fascinated by evolutionary psychology
    in general, and how embodied qualities affect our behavior, perspectives, and
    risk-taking in particular. I’m particularly interested in the evolutionary nature
    of our risk-taking behaviors in innovation decision-making contexts,” explained
    Bahlmann, an assistant professor of management and organization.

    such as financial risk-taking and decision-making. However, the realm of same-sex
    stimuli, especially among males, remained less explored, particularly in real-world
    settings.

- en: Bahlmann aimed to bridge this gap, focusing on the venture capital sector—a
    field where high-growth potential ventures attract substantial financial risks
    and where decisions have traditionally been attributed to rational analysis. Yet,
    evidence suggests that these decisions are also susceptible to the ‘attractiveness
    halo effect,’ where good looks are often subconsciously associated with positive
    traits such as intelligence or trustworthiness.

    IT ventures by leveraging information from AngelList and Crunchbase, complemented
    by LinkedIn profiles to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the ventures,
    their entrepreneurial teams, and associated investors. The focus was specifically
    on ventures with male entrepreneur-investor dyads that provided clear information
    on entrepreneurial team composition and funding processes across these platforms,
    ensuring the data’s reliability and relevance.

    profile photos of the entrepreneurs and investors. The study measured venture
    capitalists’ financial risk-taking by examining the amounts invested in the first
    and second funding rounds of the startups. Various control variables, such as
    venture age, team size, and market orientation, were included to ensure the accuracy
    of the findings.

    and venture capitalists played a significant role in the initial funding rounds.

- en: Venture capitalists of average or below-average attractiveness were more inclined
    to invest higher amounts in startups led by attractive entrepreneurs during the
    first funding round. This suggests that perceptions of physical attractiveness
    can sway investment decisions, potentially as venture capitalists seek to align
    themselves with entrepreneurs who exhibit desirable traits symbolized by their
    attractiveness.

    average in attractiveness, who showed a more consistent risk-taking behavior irrespective
    of the entrepreneur’s looks.

    a subconscious cue for a venture capitalists investment decisions, but that the
    way in which this occurs is dependent on a venture capitalist’s own physical attractiveness,”
    Bahlmann told PsyPost. “This implies that evolutionary, upward social comparison
    effects that originally serve to inspire a male’s mating strategies, also generalize
    to the context of financial risk-taking.”

    a change in how the physical attractiveness of entrepreneurs influenced investment
    decisions. For venture capitalists of below-average attractiveness, the attractiveness
    of entrepreneurs had a negative relationship with second-round risk-taking.

    biases based on attractiveness could reverse if the entrepreneurs do not meet
    the high expectations set by their physical appearance. Alternatively, it suggests
    a complex interplay where the initial attractiveness-driven biases wane as more
    substantive venture performance data become available, altering the risk assessment
    landscape.

    physical attractiveness on venture capitalist risk-taking turned negative during
    the second round of risk-taking, but only for venture capitalists of below-average
    attractiveness,” Bahlmann said. “This effect was not established for venture capitalists
    of average or above-average attractiveness.”

    in venture capital decision-making, it also has some limitations. One of the study’s
    constraints is its reliance on archival and observational data, which did not
    include information on individual psychological dispositions that could influence
    financial risk-taking.

    need to be cautious with causality claims, even though several statistical techniques
    were used to create more robust cause-effect relationships.”

    industries or contexts, examine the long-term effects of physical attractiveness
    on venture success, and investigate how other personal attributes interact with
    physical appearance to influence professional and financial decisions. There’s
    also a growing need to understand how these findings apply to female entrepreneurs
    and venture capitalists, as the representation of women in the tech industry and
    venture capital continues to increase.

    decision-making contexts,” Bahlmann said. “This ranges from venture capitalists’
    investment decisions in startups to CEOs’ and TMTs’ decision-making on which new
    technological trajectories to follow.”
