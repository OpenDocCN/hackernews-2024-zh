    Demis Hassabis.

- en: The chief of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, made his prediction on
    Monday during a TED conference in Vancouver, reported [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-16/deepmind-ceo-says-google-will-spend-more-than-100-billion-on-ai).
    Someone had asked Hassabis about the [rumored $100 billion Stargate supercomputer](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/01/microsoft_openai_5gw_dc/)
    that Google's rivals Microsoft and OpenAI are apparently planning.

    think we''re investing more than that over time." He didn''t specify how exactly
    Google would be spending that $100 billion or more, nor how quickly it would spend
    it, but he did insist that the Chocolate Factory''s processing prowess surpasses
    Microsoft''s - or anyone else''s.'

- en: One avenue for spending all that cash is likely on hardware – such as Google's
    Axion CPUs based on the Arm architecture. It's not clear what's in these upcoming
    chips, but Google claims they're 30 percent faster than "the fastest general purpose
    Arm-based instances" (likely a comparison to Ampere's or Amazon's latest CPUs),
    and 50 percent faster and 60 more efficient than x86-based processors from Intel
    and AMD. Of course, these are just Google's claims and yet to be tested independently.

    engages with the software side of AI.

    AI-discovered materials [apparently isn't that useful](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/11/google_deepmind_material_study/),
    and its weather prediction model [can't replace traditional forecast methods](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/15/google_deepmind_graphcast/)
    according to DeepMind itself.

    compute" – which he says is "one of the reasons we teamed up with Google back
    in 2014."

- en: Google might not put $100 billion into a single supercomputer, but it is certainly
    adding more compute to its portfolio – such as with its upcoming [$1B Kansas City
    datacenter](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/20/googles_kansas_city_datacenter/).
