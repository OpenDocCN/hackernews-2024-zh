    even though it’s available for download in English-speaking countries like the
    US, Canada and the UK. If you speak German, there’s a privacy policy for you.
    But if English is your only language, no privacy policy love for you!

    [Badoo](https://foundation.mozilla.org/privacynotincluded/badoo/) are also owned
    by the same company. That means your personal data can be shared from any of the
    apps within their bigger company. That’s a lot of potential sharing, and that’s
    not good.
