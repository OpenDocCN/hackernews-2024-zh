    period, from 375,000 in 2020 to almost 700,000 by 2040\. The true death toll will
    probably be higher, experts say, because of underdiagnosis and missing data in
    low- and middle-income countries.

    worldwide who are living for longer is rising. As the main risk factors for prostate
    cancer – such as being 50 or older and having a family history of the disease
    – are unavoidable, experts say it will be impossible to prevent the surge in cases
    simply via lifestyle changes or public health interventions.

    earlier diagnosis, and advances in treatments could still help reduce the burden
    and save lives, according to the authors of the 40-page report.

    James, the lead author of the study. “We know this surge in cases is coming, so
    we need to start planning and take action now.”

    often during the night; needing to rush to the toilet; difficulty in starting
    to pee; feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully, and blood in your urine
    or semen.

- en: These symptoms do not always mean you have prostate cancer. Many men’s prostates
    become larger as they get older because of a condition called benign prostate
    enlargement. Signs that prostate cancer may have spread include testicle, back
    or bone pain, a loss of appetite, and unintentional weight loss.

    He had worked in the entertainment industry for three decades, providing security
    for celebrities including Beyoncé and Bob Dylan – but the shock diagnosis ended
    his career overnight. Doctors ruled out surgery when tests showed his cancer had
    spread, and the father of six started to lose hope.

    is now extending the lives of thousands of men worldwide. Twelve years later,
    Samuels, from Harrow in north-west London, has welcomed six grandchildren to the
    world and pivoted to a second career raising awareness of cancer research.

    here today if I hadn’t been able to access a clinical trial. It was my lifeline,”
    said Samuels, now 66\. “This report has been a long time coming. Now it needs
    to be mandatory to record ethnicity in clinical trials, and trials must reflect
    the ethnic diversity of the population, so that we can find better treatments
    for people like me.”
