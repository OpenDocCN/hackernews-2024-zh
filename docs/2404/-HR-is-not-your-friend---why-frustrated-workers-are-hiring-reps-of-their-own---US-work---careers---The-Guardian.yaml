    time in the industry](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/21/future-big-tech-earning-industry-layoffs),
    with mass layoffs at Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Beale wondered if maybe her
    boss had encouraged her to put in her notice before they had a chance to officially
    lay her off so the company wouldn’t have to pay severance. The stress of it all
    started to affect her sleep and wellbeing.

    colleague named Cierra Gross, who founded an independent human resources consulting
    firm called Caged Bird HR.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For $99, Gross and her staff listen to workers’ complaints about harassment,
    discrimination, or other job-related issues – stories those workers don’t feel
    comfortable sharing with their own employers’ HR representatives. Workers at Google,
    Netflix, Amazon, Uber and Meta have all used Caged Bird, according to Gross. She
    also says Caged Bird wrote the résumé for a candidate who ended up a state senator,
    and helped a woman who was about to quit her job negotiate a $30,000 severance.
  prefs: []

    issues with compensation. Over 80% of its clients also say work has caused some
    sort of mental anguish, according to Gross.

    published last month found that more than a third of 1,005 small-business workers
    in the US didn’t trust their HR departments. In a 2021 [survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2021/11/28/why-employees-dont-trust-hr-staff-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/?sh=761645ce179f)
    of 1,000 workers at UK organizations with more than 250 employees, 47% reported
    that they didn’t trust HR to help with conflict resolution. More than two in five
    respondents didn’t believe that the department would act impartially, with 43%
    saying they think senior staff members were favored in workplace disputes.

    support system, lawyer (or at least someone who knows a lawyer), and whatever
    else a worker doesn’t feel they can find in-house. The Guardian spoke with two
    companies that have jumped into this field.

    they work and what’s going wrong. A representative then calls to explain their
    rights as workers and to give their professional opinion on how things should
    be handled. Caged Bird then drafts documents that might be helpful to the client
    when the client speaks to their employer’s HR department, such as a letter of
    resignation, a script for a pay negotiation, or a letter that reports discrimination.

    and their employer, but then our involvement is very limited,” Gross said. “In
    those cases we’re not actually allowed to talk during meetings. Even when we ghostwrite
    documents for a client, we don’t send it directly to their employer. We give it
    to the client and it’s up to them to send it to whoever they need to.”

    her job due to stress – a lifeline she hadn’t realized was available to her. “They
    let me know the options most companies don’t want you to know. It was pretty simple
    for me to get together the documents that I needed for leave,” she said. After
    a few months, she went back to work feeling recharged. She later found a new job
    in media and entertainment with a better work-life balance.

    friend” at some point in their careers. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management
    at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, says the problem is that many
    employees don’t understand how HR fits into a company as a whole, particularly
    when it comes to issues of discrimination.

- en: 'In recent years – especially after the #MeToo movement elevated awareness of
    workplace sexual harassment – employers have boasted a zero-tolerance policy on
    the matter. “That makes workers think that HR are like the internal police,” Cappelli
    said.'

    wellbeing – something analogous to a union shop steward. But that’s often too
    idealistic of a comparison.

- en: “What people don’t understand is that ultimately, HR works for the company and
    the employer organization,” Cappelli explained. “They have no particular obligations
    for you. What they do for the most part is try to nudge the organization and the
    leadership in the right direction, which is about all you can expect them to do.”

    years since the harassment awareness hashtag snowballed into a full-on movement,
    many workers have hoped that the deluge of stories might lead to better conditions.
    The same could be said after 2020’s so-called “racial reckoning”, when CEOs preached
    diversity and inclusion in a way that felt more performative than purposeful.

    America in 2022 after suffering burnout and depression. As implied by the name
    – a nod to the poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou’s memoir, I Know Why
    the Caged Bird Sings – and the fact that Gross is a Black woman with lived experience
    of workplace discrimination, Caged Bird’s earliest clients came due to issues
    of racism or sexism.

    as the brand continues to grow, we’re starting to reach a broader demographic.”

    stop with the unwanted come-ons, they can enlist BeeMail, a service that sends
    warning emails to offenders accused of sexual harassment. The subject line of
