# How Nestlé gets children hooked on sugar in lower-income countries

> 来源：[https://stories.publiceye.ch/nestle-babies/](https://stories.publiceye.ch/nestle-babies/)

Our investigation shows that Nestlé uses aggressive marketing methods to promote Nido and Cerelac in low- and middle-income countries, despite the WHO’s International Code which [prohibits](https://www.who.int/tools/elena/interventions/regulation-breast-milk-substitutes) the commercial promotion of such products. The Code, originally adopted in 1981 in the wake of the “baby killers” [scandal,](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nestle-baby-milk-scandal-food-industry-standards) and clarified and strengthened by later Resolutions, bans all promotion of infant formula in order to protect breastfeeding. The ban also [applies](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1) to formulas for young children and baby foods that, like Cerelac, do not meet nutrition guidelines and contain “high levels of sugar”.

Nestlé responds that it “complies with the WHO Code and subsequent WHA resolutions as implemented by national governments everywhere in the world.” “Where local law is less stringent than our Policy for implementing the Code, we adhere to our strict Policy,” Nestlé adds.

In practice, while 70% of countries have adopted laws based on the Code, many contain loopholes and implementation is generally [weak](https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2023/06/20/default-calendar/global-congress-on-implementation-of-the-international-code-of-marketing-of-breast-milk-substitutes) in low- and middle-income countries, often as a result of pressures from the baby-food industry and exporting countries. Furthermore, the Nestlé policy neither applies to formulas for children aged one year or more, nor to other baby foods, although these are all covered by the Code.

What’s more, Nestlé promotes its Nido and Cerelac products as healthy and essential for children’s development, although they contain added sugar and carry many risks for children’s health and development. “Often manufacturers’ health claims are not supported by the science,” says Rollins, in response to reading our report. “If you have a pharmaceutical product for which you want to claim that it improves brain development in babies, or improve growth in babies, you would have to pass very high standards of evidence,” he explains. “But because it’s a food, you don’t have to pass those standards.”

In Central and West Africa, Nestlé is active on Facebook with a page called “Nido Mums”.

Nutrition and health claims “idealize the product, imply that it is better than family foods, and mask the risks,” the WHO [explained](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/260137/9789241513470-eng.pdf?sequence=1) in a recent report that warns of baby-food marketing practices that compromise the progress made in infant and young-child nutrition. They mislead consumers as to the real content of these foods and should not be made, according to the UN agency. Yet Nestlé has made them a core pillar of its marketing strategy.

## **“Grow smart”**

“Grow smart”. Huge billboards in the centre of Jakarta and other main Indonesian cities display the slogan. It’s at the heart of Nestlé’s campaign to promote its Nido brand, known in the country as Dancow, as the “parents’ partner for children’s growth and development”. “Inspired by mum’s love for baby nutrition, Dancow is the healthiest choice”, [claims](https://www.facebook.com/DancowIndonesia/) Nestlé, while failing to disclose that its product contains added sugar.

Last year, Nestlé launched a [campaign](https://www.dancow.co.id/dpc/akudankausukadancow) aimed at “supporting the potential of children of 1 year and above in Indonesia”. The campaign managed to engage 2 million mothers in sharing “exciting moments” with their children on social media, effectively turning them into unpaid advertisers and brand ambassadors. “Thank you @dancow for accompanying my child’s growth and development,” writes one of the mothers.

Nestlé deploys the same, finely honed strategy in Brazil to promote its Cerelac (Mucilon) infant cereal brand. Its campaign is based on the concept of “nutrition enriched by Mucilon and chosen by mothers,” [muses](https://grandesnomesdapropaganda.com.br/anunciantes/nova-campanha-mostra-o-amor-dos-pais-e-a-nutricao-fortificada-por-tras-de-cada-colherada-de-mucilon/) Dani Ribeiro, director of the advertising agency in charge. It plays on parents’ love for their babies, and highlights “the benefits of nutrients that contribute to babies’ immunity and brain development,” she explains. “Parents are nourished by the fact that they are making the right choice for their children,” Ribeiro adds.

In Brazil, Nestlé promotes Cerelac (Mucilon) baby cereals as being rich in nutrients which contribute to children's immunity and cerebral development.

In South Africa, Nestlé promotes Cerelac as a source of 12 essential vitamins and minerals under the theme “little bodies need big support”. “For over 150 years, generations of parents have trusted Nestlé Cerelac to provide just what their baby needs,” [trumpets](https://www.facebook.com/CerelacSA/) the multinational. Yet all Cerelac products sold in this country, which is facing a veritable obesity [epidemic,](https://extranet.who.int/ncdccs/Data/ZAF_B10_National%20Strategy%20for%20prevention%20and%20Control%20of%20Obesity%204%20August.pdf) contain high levels of added sugar.

In South Africa, Nestlé is promoting Cerelac baby cereals under the theme "little bodies need big support". All products contain a minimum of one cube of added sugar per serving.

Chris Van Tulleken, Professor at the University of London and author of the best-selling book *Ultra-Processed People*, which explores the pervasiveness and impact of ultra-processed food, is extremely concerned about the marketing strategy used by Nestlé. “These are not healthy products. They are not necessary. They are inferior to real food,” he stated. “These types of products are part of a global nutrition transition to an ultra-processed diet which is associated with weight gain and obesity, but also many other adverse health outcomes."
