- en: The Solana ecosystem is grappling with a spate of drained wallets. A cause has
    yet to be definitively determined, but some of the thefts were linked to the use
    of trading bots like Solareum. Solareum speculated that the exploits may have
    been linked to compromised Telegram bot tokens, which could have allowed the attackers
    to obtain private keys from message history.

    website. This drew some criticism from users who accused them of doing nothing
    to investigate the hack, or even being responsible themselves. The project wrote
    on Twitter, "We at #SOLAREUM team can clarify that we DO NOT steal money." Ah,
    well, in that case.'

    point. Though there was some speculation that a trading bot called BonkBot was
    to blame, that seems to have been unfounded.
