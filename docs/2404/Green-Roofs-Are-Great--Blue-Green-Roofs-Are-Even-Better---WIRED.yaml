    the next layer, a lightweight crate system that stores the water. And finally,
    below that you’ve got additional layers to keep water and plant roots from infiltrating
    the actual roof. “You have, in fact, a flat rain barrel on top of your roof,”
    says Kasper Spaan, policy developer for climate adaptation at Waternet, Amsterdam’s
    public water management organization, which is participating in RESILIO.

  zh: 下面是一层过滤层，防止土壤进入下一层，一个轻型板条系统来储存水。最后，再加上额外的层，防止水和植物根系渗入真正的屋顶。“实际上，你的屋顶上有一个平坦的雨水桶，”阿姆斯特丹公共水务管理组织
    Waternet 的气候适应政策开发人员卡斯珀·斯潘如是说，该组织参与了 RESILIO 项目。
- en: The water levels in the blue-green roof are managed by a smart valve. If the
    weather forecast says a storm is coming, the system will release stored water
    from the roof ahead of time. That way, when a downpour comes, the roof refills,
    meaning there’s less rainwater entering the gutters and sewers in the surrounding
    area. In other words, the roof becomes a sponge that the operator can wring out
    as needed. “In the ‘squeezable’ sponge city, you make the whole city malleable,”
    says Spaan.

  zh: 蓝绿色屋顶中的水位由智能阀门管理。如果天气预报显示即将有暴风雨，系统将提前释放屋顶储存的水。这样，当暴雨来临时，屋顶就重新填充，意味着周围区域的雨水进入排水沟和下水道的量将减少。“换句话说，这个屋顶就像一个可以根据需要拧干的海绵，”斯潘说。
- en: This makes the traditional system of stormwater management more flexible, but
    also more complicated. So the RESILIO project used software from Autodesk to model
    the impact of blue-green roofs and the risk of flooding in Amsterdam, also adjusting
    for climate change.

  zh: 这使得传统的暴雨管理系统更加灵活，但也更加复杂。因此，RESILIO 项目使用 Autodesk 的软件对阿姆斯特丹的蓝绿色屋顶及洪水风险进行建模，同时还考虑了气候变化的影响。
- en: '“You can take a look at historical flood patterns, and then you can do simulations
    that will help you understand: If I could take this much capacity out of the drainage
    network, when the storm comes, I’m going reduce flooding by 10, 15, 20 percent,”
    says Amy Bunszel, executive vice president of architecture, engineering, and construction
    design solutions at Autodesk. “So our software allows them to do simulations and
    play with different trade-offs.”'

  zh: “你可以查看历史洪水模式，然后进行模拟，帮助你理解：如果我可以从排水网络中减少这么多容量，在暴风雨来临时，我将减少洪水发生的百分之十、十五或二十，”Autodesk
    建筑、工程和建筑设计解决方案执行副总裁艾米·邦赛尔说。“因此，我们的软件让他们能够进行模拟并进行不同的权衡。”
- en: Beyond the sponge-city benefits, blue-green roofs can cool the top floor of
    a building, essentially “sweating” off the stored water. With the right kinds
    of indigenous plants, they can also boost biodiversity [by catering to native
    pollinating insects](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ultra-efficient-farm-of-the-future-is-in-the-sky/).
    Going a step further, scientists are also experimenting with [growing crops on
    rooftops under solar panels](https://www.wired.com/story/your-rooftop-garden-could-be-a-solar-powered-working-farm/),
    known as rooftop agrivoltaics. Theoretically, pairing that with blue-green systems
    might actually improve the efficiency of the solar panels by cooling them with
    the evaporating water.

  zh: 超越海绵城市的好处，蓝绿色屋顶能够冷却建筑物顶层，基本上通过“出汗”方式释放储水。配合适当的本地植物，它们还能增加生物多样性，[满足本地传粉昆虫的需求](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ultra-efficient-farm-of-the-future-is-in-the-sky/)。更进一步，科学家们还在实验中，尝试在太阳能板下[种植屋顶农业兼太阳能发电](https://www.wired.com/story/your-rooftop-garden-could-be-a-solar-powered-working-farm/)，即所谓的屋顶农业光伏技术。从理论上讲，将其与蓝绿系统结合，实际上可能通过蒸发水冷却太阳能板，从而提高其效率。
