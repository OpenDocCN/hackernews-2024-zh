    the next layer, a lightweight crate system that stores the water. And finally,
    below that you’ve got additional layers to keep water and plant roots from infiltrating
    the actual roof. “You have, in fact, a flat rain barrel on top of your roof,”
    says Kasper Spaan, policy developer for climate adaptation at Waternet, Amsterdam’s
    public water management organization, which is participating in RESILIO.

    weather forecast says a storm is coming, the system will release stored water
    from the roof ahead of time. That way, when a downpour comes, the roof refills,
    meaning there’s less rainwater entering the gutters and sewers in the surrounding
    area. In other words, the roof becomes a sponge that the operator can wring out
    as needed. “In the ‘squeezable’ sponge city, you make the whole city malleable,”
    says Spaan.

    also more complicated. So the RESILIO project used software from Autodesk to model
    the impact of blue-green roofs and the risk of flooding in Amsterdam, also adjusting
    for climate change.

    that will help you understand: If I could take this much capacity out of the drainage
    network, when the storm comes, I’m going reduce flooding by 10, 15, 20 percent,”
    says Amy Bunszel, executive vice president of architecture, engineering, and construction
    design solutions at Autodesk. “So our software allows them to do simulations and
    play with different trade-offs.”'

    a building, essentially “sweating” off the stored water. With the right kinds
    of indigenous plants, they can also boost biodiversity [by catering to native
    pollinating insects](https://www.wired.com/story/the-ultra-efficient-farm-of-the-future-is-in-the-sky/).
    Going a step further, scientists are also experimenting with [growing crops on
    rooftops under solar panels](https://www.wired.com/story/your-rooftop-garden-could-be-a-solar-powered-working-farm/),
    known as rooftop agrivoltaics. Theoretically, pairing that with blue-green systems
    might actually improve the efficiency of the solar panels by cooling them with
    the evaporating water.
