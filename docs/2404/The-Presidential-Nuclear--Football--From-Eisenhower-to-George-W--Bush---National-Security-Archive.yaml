    McDermott, who led the federal Office of Emergency Planning in the 1960s, said
    the purpose of the documents was “to clothe the President with formal emergency

    authorization of mass arrests and arbitrary detentions.

    he was “concerned that the entire PEADs series is obsolete given the total devastation
    which could be expected from a thermonuclear attack.” By 1980, the PEADs had been

- en: The existence of the Football became publicly known in the first few years of
    the Johnson administration. The first mention of it in the national press may
    have been in the syndicated “Allen-Scott Report” in July 1965 which quoted White
    House aide Jack Valenti saying that that “the ‘black bag’ or ‘football,’ as we
    call it, goes wherever the President travels.” The Football connected the President
    to the Strategic Air Command, according to Valenti, who added that there were
    a “dozen military aides who carry the briefcase on a shift basis.” The article
    also suggested that President Johnson may have been uncomfortable with the arrangement
    because Valenti denied “published reports President Johnson is transferring some
    of the functions of his military aides to the Pentagon.”[[1]](#_edn1) Four months
    later, Bob Horton of *The Baltimore Sun* reported that the “satchel” included
    a “portfolio of cryptographic orders” to the Joint Chiefs to authorize a nuclear
    retaliation. An authorizing message could be sent by telephone, teletype or microwave
    radio. Horton also learned that, through arrangements established by the Defense
    Communications Agency, the authorizing messages could be sent to the North American
    Air Defense Command or the Strategic Air Command.[[2]](#_edn2)

    四个月后，《巴尔的摩太阳报》的鲍勃·霍顿报导称这个“书包”包含了一份“联合参谋会的密码指令”以授权核反击。授权信息可以通过电话、电传或微波电台发送。霍顿还了解到，通过国防通信局建立的安排，这些授权信息可以发送到北美防空司令部或战略空军司令部。[[2]](#_edn2)

    focus on interviewing the people who were with and near President Kennedy at the
    time of his assassination, Manchester learned a great deal about the military
    aides and warrant officers who traveled with the President and who were responsible
    for the Football. Among the interviewees were White House military aides, including
    Tazewell Shepard, Godfrey McHugh, and Chester Clifton, and Joint Chief of Staff
    Chairman Maxwell Taylor. Excerpts from the interviews, on file at the Wesleyan
    University Library, are published here for the first time and include rich details
    about the Football, its contents, and the arrangements for carrying it. While

    to Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who turned down the arrangement for reasons
    still unknown. While future revelations may help clarify Johnson’s reasons for
    declining the offer, Manchester’s discussion with Maxwell Taylor confirmed that
    high level military leaders were concerned that he had not received a briefing
    about the “contents” of the Football before he became President in Dallas on November
    22, 1963.[[3]](#_edn3) Years later, after he left office, Johnson suggested that

  zh: 《Football》的内容中很少讨论的一个元素是一套总统紧急行动文件——以前称为紧急行动文件——包括一系列总统公告和行政命令，涉及各种问题，用于国家紧急情况。[5]
    这些文件起源于艾森豪威尔政府时期，作为紧急行动文件（或EADs），它们的“法律授权”来自于“总统在宪法下的特别权力”。虽然没有一个文件看起来已经解密，但是《联邦紧急计划D-减》（*Federal
    Emergency Plan D-Minus*）（https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/4564667/Document-02-Executive-Office-of-the-President.pdf），日期为1959年4月，概述了它们，包括一项宣布“无限国家紧急状态和民防紧急状态”的文件。未提及的是一个难以预测的问题：在核战争爆发后，谁将在场实施，更不用说服从这些法令了。
- en: One of the proclamations authorized the Director of the Office of Civil and
    Defense Mobilization to determine when a state government or one of its political
    subdivisions was “unable or unwilling to perform essential civil functions” and
    to “take responsibility for those functions” with the assistance of military commanders
    who had resources “not needed for the conduct of military operations.” This and
    another proclamation authorizing the Secretary of Defense “to maintain public
    order and enforce Federal, State and local laws” when “necessary” would have created
    the conditions for the imposition of martial law. Another proclamation authorized
    the “apprehension of persons considered dangerous to national security,” while

- en: The EADs were later renamed Civil Emergency Action Documents and then Presidential
    Emergency Action Documents, and their contents have been revised over time, but
    most of the details remain classified. The results of a 1962 updating, consisting
    mostly of changes in presentation and organization, were forwarded from Edward
    McDermott, the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, to Captain Tazewell
    Shepard on the White House staff on October 29, 1962\. The contents were essentially
    the same as the EADs that Eisenhower had turned over to the Kennedy administration,
    although McDermott had plans to “improve” them and add new directives. McDermott
    said the directives included documents designed to clothe “the President with
    formal emergency powers, to provide control over individuals for internal security
    purposes, to dispose of normal administrative requirements, to augment the armed
    forces, to assume functions of State and local governments in exceptional circumstances,
    to mobilize resources, and miscellaneous others.” McDermott also had some misgivings,

    legality.”

    McDermott）于1962年10月29日转交给白宫幕僚塔泽维尔·谢泼德船长。其内容基本与艾森豪威尔交接给肯尼迪政府的EADs相同，尽管麦克德莫特有计划“改进”它们并增加新的指令。麦克德莫特表示，这些指令包括旨在赋予“总统正式的紧急权力，提供内部安全目的的个人控制，处理正常的行政要求，增强武装部队，承担州和地方政府在特殊情况下的职能，动员资源及其他杂项”的文件。麦克德莫特还对一些指令有所疑虑，但没有具体说明这些指令是否“法律上可疑”。
- en: Where McDermott took the PEADs review process after October 1962 remains to
    be learned but reviewing and updating occurred during the Carter administration.
    One of the characteristics of Jimmy Carter's Presidency was his significant interest
    in crisis planning, including the problem of emergency relocation and continuity
    of government arrangements in the event of nuclear war. This was a period when
    perceived [vulnerabilities](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb403/) made
    government and military officials more and more apprehensive about the security
    of command and control systems. Moreover, as recent biographers have pointed out,
    compared to many of his predecessors, Jimmy Carter was personally secure enough
    to give Vice President Walter Mondale a significant role in national security
    policy because he recognized that in a dire emergency the Vice President had to
    be ready to assume the presidency.  Accordingly, Mondale was assigned a Football
    and one was eventually deployed to his official residence.[[6]](#_edn6)

- en: In keeping with the strong interest in emergency planning, White House officials
    worried about the status of the PEADs. Not only was Zbigniew Brzezinski’s military
    assistant, William Odom, troubled over the “legality” of some of them, President
    Carter’s second cousin, Hugh Carter, Jr., who played a key role in White House
    emergency planning, had become “concerned that the entire PEADs series is obsolete
    given the total devastation which could be expected from a thermonuclear attack
    on the US.” Those concerns necessitated “an updated approach to reconstituting

- en: What exactly Hugh Carter’s worries meant for the updating of the PEADs is not
    clear, but the review had been completed by May 1980, and the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) turned over the updated documents to the White House
    so they could be included in the Football. What happened to the order concerning
    habeas corpus is not known. However, it is clear that some legal issues had not
    been entirely resolved. In one case, FEMA director John Macy said it was inappropriate
    to seek OMB and DOJ clearance for a PEAD on national resources mobilization that
    was initially approved by President Richard Nixon in 1970 “because of its reliance
    on the ‘implied’ powers of the President and in the absence of a definitive legal
    basis for the PEAD.”
