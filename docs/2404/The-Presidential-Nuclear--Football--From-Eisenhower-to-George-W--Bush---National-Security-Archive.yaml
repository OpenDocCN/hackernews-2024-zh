    plans kept inside the closely guarded “Football” that traveled with the President
    at all times and that would give the federal government sweeping emergency powers
    were of “doubtful legality,” “badly out of date,” and “even illegal,” according
    to top government officials whose views are memorialized in declassified records
    posted today by the National Security Archive.'

- en: Since the late 1950s, U.S. military personnel traveling with the President have
    carried a special case known variously as the “satchel,” the “black bag,” the
    “emergency actions pouch” and, as it is perhaps best known, the “Football.” Epitomizing
    presidential control of nuclear weapons, the Football and the military aides who
    carry it enable the President to make decisions about the use of nuclear weapons
    in the event of a sudden military crisis.

- en: While the existence of the Football has been known since the 1960s, reliable
    details about its contents have been relatively scarce. During the Cold War, and
    possibly later, they included proclamations and executive orders known as Presidential
    Emergency Action Documents (PEADs) for use in a national emergency. Edward A.
    McDermott, who led the federal Office of Emergency Planning in the 1960s, said
    the purpose of the documents was “to clothe the President with formal emergency
    powers,” although he said some were of “doubtful legality,” perhaps because they
    included the suspension of habeas corpus, a declaration of martial law, and the
    authorization of mass arrests and arbitrary detentions.

- en: Today’s posting by the National Security Archive includes several documents
    about the contents of the PEADs and the Carter administration’s efforts to revise
    directives considered “badly out of date.” The President’s second cousin, Hugh
    Carter, Jr., who played a leading role in White House emergency planning, said
    he was “concerned that the entire PEADs series is obsolete given the total devastation
    which could be expected from a thermonuclear attack.” By 1980, the PEADs had been
    revised and updated and were ready to be placed in the President’s “emergency
    portfolio.”

    to assign a Football to Vice President Walter Mondale, with one permanently stationed
    at his residence. This was in keeping with Mondale's substantive and innovative
    role in national security policy. It remains unclear whether the four vice presidents
    who held the office between Johnson and Mondale were assigned Footballs, but so
    far there is no evidence to suggest that they were.

- en: The existence of the Football became publicly known in the first few years of
    the Johnson administration. The first mention of it in the national press may
    have been in the syndicated “Allen-Scott Report” in July 1965 which quoted White
    House aide Jack Valenti saying that that “the ‘black bag’ or ‘football,’ as we
    call it, goes wherever the President travels.” The Football connected the President
    to the Strategic Air Command, according to Valenti, who added that there were
    a “dozen military aides who carry the briefcase on a shift basis.” The article
    also suggested that President Johnson may have been uncomfortable with the arrangement
    because Valenti denied “published reports President Johnson is transferring some
    of the functions of his military aides to the Pentagon.”[[1]](#_edn1) Four months
    later, Bob Horton of *The Baltimore Sun* reported that the “satchel” included
    a “portfolio of cryptographic orders” to the Joint Chiefs to authorize a nuclear
    retaliation. An authorizing message could be sent by telephone, teletype or microwave
    radio. Horton also learned that, through arrangements established by the Defense
    Communications Agency, the authorizing messages could be sent to the North American
    Air Defense Command or the Strategic Air Command.[[2]](#_edn2)

- en: Manchester’s book was probably the first to mention the Football, and with his
    focus on interviewing the people who were with and near President Kennedy at the
    time of his assassination, Manchester learned a great deal about the military
    aides and warrant officers who traveled with the President and who were responsible
    for the Football. Among the interviewees were White House military aides, including
    Tazewell Shepard, Godfrey McHugh, and Chester Clifton, and Joint Chief of Staff
    Chairman Maxwell Taylor. Excerpts from the interviews, on file at the Wesleyan
    University Library, are published here for the first time and include rich details
    about the Football, its contents, and the arrangements for carrying it. While
    such interviews have to be read cautiously and skeptically, the fact that they
    took place only months after the events lends them credibility.

    1961, President Kennedy’s security staff offered a satchel and a military aide
    to Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who turned down the arrangement for reasons
    still unknown. While future revelations may help clarify Johnson’s reasons for
    declining the offer, Manchester’s discussion with Maxwell Taylor confirmed that
    high level military leaders were concerned that he had not received a briefing
    about the “contents” of the Football before he became President in Dallas on November
    22, 1963.[[3]](#_edn3) Years later, after he left office, Johnson suggested that
    he found the presence of the military aide and the Football to be stressful.[[4]](#_edn4)

    Presidential Emergency Action Documents—previously known as Emergency Action Papers—consisting
    of presidential proclamations and executive orders on a range of issues for use
    in a national emergency.[[5]](#_edn5) Originating during the Eisenhower administration
    as Emergency Action Documents (or EADs), they derived their presumed “legal authority”
    from the “extraordinary powers of the President under the Constitution.” While
    none of them appear to have been declassified, [*Federal Emergency Plan D-Minus*](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/4564667/Document-02-Executive-Office-of-the-President.pdf),
    dated April 1959, outlined them, including one declaring “the existence of an
    unlimited national emergency and a state of civil defense emergency.” Left unsaid
    was an imponderable: Who, after nuclear war had begun, would be around to implement,
    much less obey, such edicts?'

    Defense Mobilization to determine when a state government or one of its political
    subdivisions was “unable or unwilling to perform essential civil functions” and
    to “take responsibility for those functions” with the assistance of military commanders
    who had resources “not needed for the conduct of military operations.” This and
    another proclamation authorizing the Secretary of Defense “to maintain public
    order and enforce Federal, State and local laws” when “necessary” would have created
    the conditions for the imposition of martial law. Another proclamation authorized
    the “apprehension of persons considered dangerous to national security,” while
    an executive order established an Office of Censorship to “censor communications
    crossing the borders of the United States.”

- en: The EADs were later renamed Civil Emergency Action Documents and then Presidential
    Emergency Action Documents, and their contents have been revised over time, but
    most of the details remain classified. The results of a 1962 updating, consisting
    mostly of changes in presentation and organization, were forwarded from Edward
    McDermott, the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning, to Captain Tazewell
    Shepard on the White House staff on October 29, 1962\. The contents were essentially
    the same as the EADs that Eisenhower had turned over to the Kennedy administration,
    although McDermott had plans to “improve” them and add new directives. McDermott
    said the directives included documents designed to clothe “the President with
    formal emergency powers, to provide control over individuals for internal security
    purposes, to dispose of normal administrative requirements, to augment the armed
    forces, to assume functions of State and local governments in exceptional circumstances,
    to mobilize resources, and miscellaneous others.” McDermott also had some misgivings,
    suggesting that some of the orders, which he did not specify, were of “doubtful
    legality.”

- en: Where McDermott took the PEADs review process after October 1962 remains to
    be learned but reviewing and updating occurred during the Carter administration.
    One of the characteristics of Jimmy Carter's Presidency was his significant interest
    in crisis planning, including the problem of emergency relocation and continuity
    of government arrangements in the event of nuclear war. This was a period when
    perceived [vulnerabilities](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb403/) made
    government and military officials more and more apprehensive about the security
    of command and control systems. Moreover, as recent biographers have pointed out,
    compared to many of his predecessors, Jimmy Carter was personally secure enough
    to give Vice President Walter Mondale a significant role in national security
    policy because he recognized that in a dire emergency the Vice President had to
    be ready to assume the presidency.  Accordingly, Mondale was assigned a Football
    and one was eventually deployed to his official residence.[[6]](#_edn6)

- en: In keeping with the strong interest in emergency planning, White House officials
    worried about the status of the PEADs. Not only was Zbigniew Brzezinski’s military
    assistant, William Odom, troubled over the “legality” of some of them, President
    Carter’s second cousin, Hugh Carter, Jr., who played a key role in White House
    emergency planning, had become “concerned that the entire PEADs series is obsolete
    given the total devastation which could be expected from a thermonuclear attack
    on the US.” Those concerns necessitated “an updated approach to reconstituting
    order and organization at the local, state and federal levels of the Government.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What exactly Hugh Carter’s worries meant for the updating of the PEADs is not
    clear, but the review had been completed by May 1980, and the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency (FEMA) turned over the updated documents to the White House
    so they could be included in the Football. What happened to the order concerning
    habeas corpus is not known. However, it is clear that some legal issues had not
    been entirely resolved. In one case, FEMA director John Macy said it was inappropriate
    to seek OMB and DOJ clearance for a PEAD on national resources mobilization that
    was initially approved by President Richard Nixon in 1970 “because of its reliance
    on the ‘implied’ powers of the President and in the absence of a definitive legal
    basis for the PEAD.”

    the role of the PEADs in federal emergency planning and their evolution during
    the decades of the Cold War. In particular, long-pending declassification requests
    now before the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel may someday lead
    to the release of more details on the Football arrangements during the 1960s.
