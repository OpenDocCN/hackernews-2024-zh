- en: The first time Tony Ford played Dungeons & Dragons, he was a wiry Black kid
    who had never seen the inside of a prison. His mother, a police officer in Detroit,
    had quit the force and moved the family to West Texas. To Ford, it seemed like
    a different world. Strangers talked funny, and El Paso was half desert. But he
    could skateboard in all that open space, and he eventually befriended a nerdy
    White kid with a passion for Dungeons & Dragons. Ford fell in love with the role-playing
    game right away; it was complex and cerebral, a saga you could lose yourself in.
    And in the 1980s, [everyone seemed to be playing it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/us/when-dungeons-dragons-set-off-a-moral-panic.html)

    game known for its miniature figurines and 20-sided dice. Players were entranced
    by the way it combined a choose-your-own-adventure structure with group performance.
    In D&D, participants create their own characters — often magical creatures like
    elves and wizards — to go on quests in fantasy worlds. A narrator and referee,
    [known as the Dungeon Master](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/books/dungeons-dragons.html),
    guides players through each twist and turn of the plot. There’s an element of
    chance: The roll of the die can determine if a blow is strong enough to take down
    a monster or whether a stranger will help you. The game has since become one of
    the [most popular in the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/21/style/dungeons-and-dragons.html),

    girls, cars and friends who sold drugs and ran with gangs. Ford started doing
    those things, too. He didn’t get into serious trouble until Dec. 18, 1991\. Sometime
    before 9 p.m., two Black men knocked on the door of a small home on Dale Douglas
    Drive in southeast El Paso, asking for “the man of the house.” The woman who answered,
    Myra Murillo, refused to let them in. A few minutes later, they returned, breaking
    down the door and demanding money and jewelry. One opened fire, killing Murillo’s
    18-year-old son, Armando.

    car the whole time. There was no physical evidence clearly connecting him to the
    crime. He was so confident that a jury would believe him that he rejected a plea

  zh: 那天晚上在殡仪馆，沃德洛在自由世界的女友——长期的笔友和反死刑活动家——第一次触摸到他，她哭泣着抚摸着他的脸，当他躺在棺材里时。她事后给我发消息，问我是否想要他的游戏用品的硬纸板盒。盒子里，一张老旧的纸让我屏住了呼吸：那是1997年写给卡尔·科尔的手写道歉信。折叠起来，它藏在数百页角色草图、游戏图表和手绘地图之间，这些是巫师和兽人的幻想世界的遗迹。沃德洛的律师最近说，那封信从未寄出，但沃德洛在被处决后又写了一封信给科尔家人。

    things that he once enjoyed. “This place, it does something to you,” he told me
    during one of our visits.

  zh: 自从沃德洛去世后，福特阅读和做曾经喜欢的小事情变得更加困难。“这个地方会改变你，”他在其中一次拜访时告诉我。
- en: Ford watched other friends and fellow players face execution dates, and he began
    to worry about when the state would set his. In the meantime, a team of lawyers
    asked him to be a lead plaintiff in a [lawsuit aimed at changing the isolating
    conditions of death row](https://www.hoganlovells.com/-/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/2023-pdfs/2023_01_26_robertsoncomplaintfiledversion.pdf).
    They filed the case this January, and it is still pending. If they win, the men
    at Polunsky might be able to play D&D together again, sitting around a table for
    the first time in two decades. Wardlow, of course, won’t be there. “As long as
    we have D&D,” Ford told me, “we’re keeping his legacy alive.”

  zh: 福特目睹其他朋友和队友面对执行日期，他开始担心州政府何时会安排他的。与此同时，一队律师要求他成为[旨在改变死囚隔离条件的诉讼](https://www.hoganlovells.com/-/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/2023-pdfs/2023_01_26_robertsoncomplaintfiledversion.pdf)的首席原告。他们在今年一月提起了诉讼，目前仍在等待中。如果他们赢了，Polunsky
    的这些人也许能够再次一起玩D&D，在长达20年后第一次围坐在一张桌子旁。当然，沃德洛不会在那里了。“只要我们玩D&D，”福特告诉我，“我们就在活着维护他的遗产。”
