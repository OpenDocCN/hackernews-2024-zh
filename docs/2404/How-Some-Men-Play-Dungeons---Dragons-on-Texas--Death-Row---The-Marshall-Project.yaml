    who had never seen the inside of a prison. His mother, a police officer in Detroit,
    had quit the force and moved the family to West Texas. To Ford, it seemed like
    a different world. Strangers talked funny, and El Paso was half desert. But he
    could skateboard in all that open space, and he eventually befriended a nerdy
    White kid with a passion for Dungeons & Dragons. Ford fell in love with the role-playing
    game right away; it was complex and cerebral, a saga you could lose yourself in.
    And in the 1980s, [everyone seemed to be playing it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/us/when-dungeons-dragons-set-off-a-moral-panic.html)

    game known for its miniature figurines and 20-sided dice. Players were entranced
    by the way it combined a choose-your-own-adventure structure with group performance.
    In D&D, participants create their own characters — often magical creatures like
    elves and wizards — to go on quests in fantasy worlds. A narrator and referee,
    [known as the Dungeon Master](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/books/dungeons-dragons.html),
    guides players through each twist and turn of the plot. There’s an element of
    chance: The roll of the die can determine if a blow is strong enough to take down
    a monster or whether a stranger will help you. The game has since become one of
    the [most popular in the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/21/style/dungeons-and-dragons.html),

    girls, cars and friends who sold drugs and ran with gangs. Ford started doing
    those things, too. He didn’t get into serious trouble until Dec. 18, 1991\. Sometime
    before 9 p.m., two Black men knocked on the door of a small home on Dale Douglas
    Drive in southeast El Paso, asking for “the man of the house.” The woman who answered,
    Myra Murillo, refused to let them in. A few minutes later, they returned, breaking
    down the door and demanding money and jewelry. One opened fire, killing Murillo’s
    18-year-old son, Armando.

    else. Just as in the free world, each gaming session can last for hours and is
    part of a larger campaign that often stretches on for months or years. But in
    prison, players can’t just look up the game rules online. The hard-bound manuals
    that detail settings, characters and spells are expensive and can be difficult
    to get past mailroom censors. [Some states ban books](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state)
    about the game altogether, while others prohibit anything with a hard cover. Books

    have had two, but his parents’ second child died at 6 months. His mother, Wardlow

    to him, even when it was just a one-way conversation through the rec-cage fence.
    At first, Wardlow just mused aloud about whatever was on his mind, his voice calming
    and hypnotic. As he kept talking, Ford started to open up, too, crying as he recounted
    memories of his mother. He remembered the pride she took in her work as a police
    officer, and how much she taught him about computers when she worked in an Atari
    warehouse years later. He remembered how she showed him the basics of chess. At
    one point, Wardlow sent over some jelly beans — he knew Ford loved them, especially
    the black ones.

    told me two years ago during one of our first in-person interviews. “I’m just
    talking about her.” A few weeks later, he jumped back in the game.

    how the players were facing a potentially world-ending threat. Wardlow knew he
    had to join the game to save the story. “I’m in,” Wardlow said. And so Arthaxx,
    his character, opened his eyes.

    new invention when a green fog swept in, rolling down from the palaces. Arthaxx
    saw it coming and fired a spell, but the magic clashed with the mist and his spell
    came to life, attacking its creator. Arthaxx fell unconscious.

    years had passed, and the world he knew was in ruins. By that point, an evil moon
    called Atropus had begun orbiting the planet, bringing down a foul rain that made
    the dead rise from their graves.

    locked away in an hourglass prison. Without them, good magic no longer worked.

    came at a heavy price. Half the adventurers died, and the survivors soon realized
    they still needed to free the gods. To do that, Arthaxx cast a spell to turn himself
    into a more powerful being. It was potentially a winning move, but it was risky,
    too: The being had a tendency to explode, especially if he suffered a serious
    blow.'

    to prevail when the crew faced off against a horde of villains — the outcome came
    down to chance. “One of the things of D&D is that it’s the roll of the dice,”
    Ford told me, leaning toward the glass between us during one of my visits. “And
    if you make a roll of the dice and your dice roll is too low to be able to save
    you,” he said, “then, you know, you bite the bullet.”

    realized they were trapped in a story line they were powerless to imagine their
    way out of. “You have this certain reality,” Ford told me. “Not only are they
    telling you that one of your best friends that you consider your brother is going
    to die on this particular day, but that you pretty much have nothing that you
    can do about it.”

    campaign that he created for a few of his friends, involving a mythical city and
    a quest to save a magic sword. “I’m sure you’ve seen those Final Episodes of your
    favorite shows,” Wardlow wrote to me in his last letter on June 24, 2020, which
    he composed on his prison typewriter. “That’s what this is like. Although I hope
    this isn’t the Final Episode.” Two weeks later, the state executed him.

    — a longtime pen pal and anti-death-penalty activist — touched him for the first
    time, sobbing and caressing his face as he lay in his coffin. She messaged me
    afterward to ask if I wanted his cardboard box of gaming supplies. Inside, an
    aging piece of paper made me catch my breath: It was a handwritten apology to
    Carl Cole’s son, dated 1997\. Folded in half, it sat tucked among hundreds of
    pages of character sketches, game charts and hand-drawn maps, the remnants of
    a fantasy world of wizards and orcs. That letter was never mailed, Wardlow’s lawyer
    said recently, but Wardlow wrote another one to the Cole family that was sent
    after he was executed.'

    to worry about when the state would set his. In the meantime, a team of lawyers
    asked him to be a lead plaintiff in a [lawsuit aimed at changing the isolating
    conditions of death row](https://www.hoganlovells.com/-/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/2023-pdfs/2023_01_26_robertsoncomplaintfiledversion.pdf).
    They filed the case this January, and it is still pending. If they win, the men
    at Polunsky might be able to play D&D together again, sitting around a table for
    the first time in two decades. Wardlow, of course, won’t be there. “As long as
    we have D&D,” Ford told me, “we’re keeping his legacy alive.”
