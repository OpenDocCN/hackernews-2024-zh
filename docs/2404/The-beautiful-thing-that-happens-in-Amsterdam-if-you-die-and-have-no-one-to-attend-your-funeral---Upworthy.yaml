    to make compromises on ingredient quality when shopping for meals. A recent study
    published by [Supermarket News](https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/families-are-buying-lower-quality-food-deal-inflation-report)
    found that 41% of families with children were more likely to switch to lower-quality
    groceries to deal with inflation.
