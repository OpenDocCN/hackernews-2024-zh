    it hasn’t been part of our lives for a decade: a way to look up a phone number
    that just called you, right from your recent calls screen. X user AssembleDebug
    [tipped off *PiunikaWeb*](https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/05/google-pixel-phone-app-lookup-feature/)
    to a new “Lookup” button in the beta version of the Google Phone app that, when
    tapped, brings up a Google Search with the number already entered for you.'
  prefs: []

- en: Although the Google Phone app is the default for Pixel phones, other Android
    owners can download it. The new Lookup button lives with other options, like “Block”
    and “History,” that you see when you tap on a recent call in the Phone app. In
    an age where so much spam comes from [spoofed phone numbers](https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing)
    made to look like local calls, it almost feels like the feature is about five
    years too late.

    process of copying unknown numbers that pester me and pasting them into a Google
    search. These days, I only do it after I see the same number more than once, but
    that happens often enough that I would love to stop messing with the clunky smartphone
    copy / paste song and dance.

    that Google is working on adding Gemini email summaries to the Android version
    of the Gmail app. As you can see in the screenshot above, the feature exists as
    a button just under the subject line of an email. Tap it, and it will give you
    a summary. At least, that’s the presumed idea. [*PiunikaWeb* writes that](https://piunikaweb.com/2024/04/05/gmail-summarize-this-email-android/)
    the button doesn’t do anything quite yet, but that there is also a new Gemini
    menu option in Gmail’s three dots menu.'

- en: In the meantime, the Android Gemini app can summarize emails for you (provided
    you have a Google Workspace account). It would obviously be a lot nicer to have
    Gemini do this in Gmail directly, which is [already how it works on the web](/2023/9/19/23878999/google-bard-ai-chatbot-gmail-docs-drive-extensions).
