    in 4K blocks, matching the [default](https://sqlite.org/pgszchng2016.html) SQLite

- en: Adiantum is a cipher composition for disk encryption. The standard threat model
    for disk encryption considers an adversary that can read multiple snapshots of
    a disk. The only security property that disk encryption provides is that all information
    such an adversary can obtain is whether the data in a sector has or has not changed
    over time.

    backups) of a database file can learn precisely: which blocks changed, which ones
    didn''t, which got reverted.'

- en: This is slightly weaker than other forms of SQLite encryption that include *some*
    nondeterminism; with limited nondeterminism, an adversary can't distinguish between
    blocks that actually changed, and blocks that got reverted.

    `"adiantum"` encrypted backups of your database, and want to protect against forgery,
    you should sign your backups, and verify signatures before restoring them.

    [MACs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code). Block-level
    MACs can protect against forging individual blocks, but can't prevent them from
    being reverted to former versions of themselves.
