    But the man himself remains in the shadows, a name less well known than some of
    the other personalities in Chanel’s circle: Stravinsky, Diaghilev & Nijinsky of
    the Ballets Russes, and Winston Churchill, to name a few.**'

    by two marriages. His parents were French expatriates and the children grew up
    to speak French and Russian fluently.

    in the industry. Beaux was not a Grassois but he was almost as lucky. His brother
    Édouard, who was eighteen years older than him, worked at Rallet – a large perfume
    and soap maker in Moscow. Rallet was a prestigious company that supplied toiletries
    to the Tsar and other European royals, and so was an ideal springboard for a young
    perfumer.

    so young Beaux’ path to the top was assured. Rallet was then owned by Chiris,
    the perfume supplier from Grasse, so, unlike François Coty, who had to travel
    to Grasse to learn his trade, Grasse came to Beaux. Ernest started at Rallet in
    the soap division, and he finished as director of perfumery.

    as being intransigent. She writes how, once he rose to authority, Ernest became
    so hated by his workers they talked about throwing him in a vat of boiling soap.
    Luckily, Édouard was a diplomatic soul and would smooth things over when his brother
    got into trouble.

    as an artillery officer. His unit of Breton gunners was posted to Russia, possibly
    the Kola peninsula, which is near the lakes of Murmansk in the Arctic circle.
    The time he spent there was a foundational experience for Beaux, one that he would
    draw on later in his career.

    of setting up a chemical weapons factory. One day there was an explosion in the
    production facility and Beaux was exposed to Cloropicrin, a poison gas. He was
    immediately rushed to hospital where he remained for two months. When he recovered,
    he could have accepted a medical discharge but he volunteered to go back, and
    returned to the fighting in Russia.

    and laid siege to Kiev. In December of that year Beaux was given another special
    assignment, this time of a secret nature. His job was to enter the Ukrainian capital
    and remove all sensitive materials from the British and French embassies. This
    was not armed conflict but was nonetheless extremely dangerous. Nathalie Beaux
    writes that Ernest's car was hit by bullets on his way to the capital, but he
    and a colleague still managed to reach their destination where their task was
    to burn the embassies' documents, bury the caches of weapons, and organise the
    removal of White Russians and western agents from the encircled city.

    put a bounty on the head of this French 'liaison officer'. As a consequence he
    had to work in disguise, frequently changing residence and assuming different
    identities. It was surely thanks to his fluent Russian that Beaux managed to remain
    undetected for three months, and, after completing his mission, he escaped Kiev
    and reported back to French Military Intelligence.

    who was eighteen at the time. Nathalie comments that 'besides a magnetic attraction
    – one for the other – they had nothing in common'. Beaux was refined and urbane,
    an art lover who enjoyed the ballet and concerts. By contrast, Ida was out of
    her depths in polite society, and – especially after the birth of their son Mitya
    – preferred to stay at home. If it wasn't already a dysfunctional union, when
    her beloved 'Nestia' returned from the war – damaged psychologically by what he
    had seen and done – it became evident to both parties there was no future for
    them together, and they began to drift apart.

    Bolsheviks, and when Ida went there looking for him, she found the locks changed
    and someone else living there. She stayed long enough to gather up some documents
    and family photos, and then left – never to return. Because he and Ida had lost
    touch, when Ernest arrived in Moscow he was unaware of the situation with his
    apartment and was shocked to be told by the new occupants that he had no rights
    to his property, and he should leave before they called the commissar.

    raiding party. They were sent up-river on a commando-style mission to seize an
    outpost of the Red army, which they achieved after several days of skirmishing.
    Going through captured documents, Beaux realised a large force of Red Guards had
    been alerted and would soon arrive, so he ordered a hasty withdrawal and he and
    his unit returned to Allied lines with valuable intelligence.

    White Russian government, and the British Military Cross. More significantly,
    he was transferred to a new role, this time in Archangel, the port city on the
    Arctic coast. He was assigned to Mudyug Island, where the so called Interventionist
    Forces of the Western Allies operated a prison camp for captured suspects.

    or revolutionary sympathisers, and who were White loyalists or merely innocents
    caught up in the chaos. Some 'ordinary' prisoners were given their freedom – in
    return for serving in a White Russian battalion, but those thought to be partisans
    had a much worse fate. The authorities had at their disposal open air Ice Cells,
    where recalcitrant prisoners would be held until they either talked, or succumbed
    to the cold.

- en: N°5 is not only the most famous perfume in the world but is still one of its
    best sellers. This is not without reason. It has benefited from highly successful
    marketing but it is, without doubt, a wonderful perfume; audacious, but lush and
    perfectly composed, rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It would be hard to overestimate
    its influence on the history of western perfumery. Although it wasn't the first
    aldehydic bouquet – that was Quelques Fleurs, which Beaux had studied closely
    – N°5 is often thought to be the founding work of the genre. For many people it
    is *the* aldehydic, in the sense that Shalimar is the Mother of all Ambers (the
    genre once known as Oriental).
  id: totrans-split-22

- en: There is an apocryphal story that Chanel N°5 was the result of a compounding
    error; an assistant used pure aldehydes rather than the 10% prescribed. But Beaux
    insisted the overdose was intentional and it was inspired by the Arctic, where
    – according to an article in Perfumer & Flavorist – the midnight sun releases
    ‘an extremely fresh scent from the lakes’.

    – create his perfume based on the odours [of] the High North'. But more than that,
    his perfume was charged with memories of Ida – and her ‘palest of blue eyes’.
    For Beaux, creating perfume was 'a way to make sense of the years of separation,
    of violence and death, and above all the terrible silence’ that he experienced
    in Siberia.

    using new materials which 'could come from nature, *or* from science'. As it turned

    like variations of his most famous work. What is less well known however, is he
    also worked for another brand.

    and perfume house Bourjois, Beaux became head perfumer for both companies. During
    this time he created Bourjois' best known work Soir de Paris (1928). Unfortunately,
    this has been reformulated and has little to do with the work of Beaux. There
    still exist other Bourjois perfumes by him though, of which one is Flamme (1932).
    It opens with an unusual green bergamot and hyacinth, and possibly violet leaf,
    but underneath it’s a woody aldehydic and soft-rose bouquet; rather like a budget
    N°5.

    the profit she received from Parfums Chanel and as a result she decided to release
    her own perfumes under the brand name Mademoiselle Chanel. It's not clear if this
    was a serious venture, or just a bargaining chip to use against her business partners,
    but the existence of a perfume called Mademoiselle Chanel N°1 is not in doubt.
    Examples of N°1 still exist, but they are very rare indeed.

    all, who better to create a concourant of N°5 than the perfumer behind the original?

    expressly forbidden by Chanel's contract with the Wertheimer's – who were his
    employers after all. Friends of Chanel called it ‘Super N°5’. History doesn’t
    recall what the Wertheimers said...

    in 2007 the results of a GCMS of the juice were published in an article by Perfumer
    & Flavorist. Excerpts of this are quoted on the website perfumeprojects.com where
    it states that MC No 1 was 'similar in concept to Rallet No1' which is known to
    be the work of Beaux.

- en: The article goes on to note that the aldehyde cocktail in N°5 was replaced by
    a whopping 25% of *a*-n-methyl ionone, and so, Mademoiselle Chanel N°1 becomes
    'a violet – orris modification of the Chanel N°5 theme'. The main difference being
    the aldehydes are replaced by another synthetic molecule.

    [were] in the 1910''s''; an innovation which is in keeping with Beaux’ stated
    enthusiasm for new materials. Even though a 25% overdose was an audacious and
    highly unusual practice at the time, as we know from No5, it was not foreign to
    the work of Beaux.'
  id: totrans-split-33

- en: Another argument to support the idea that MC N°1 was the work of Beaux is the
    assertion that *a*-n-methyl ionone – at the time an unusual and hard to find molecule
    – would have been available to him in the form of Raldeine A, a captive of Givaudan,
    which was owned by Beaux’ old friend Leon Givaudan.

    the use of an overdose of a novel material ... bear Beaux' signature’. In the
    light of this, Perfumeprojects.com concludes; Mademoiselle Chanel N°1 is ‘difficult
    to attribute to anyone but Ernest Beaux’. However, it still can’t be proved that
    Beaux was behind Chanel's pirate perfume – neither he nor anyone else would talk.
