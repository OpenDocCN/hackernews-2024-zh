    But the man himself remains in the shadows, a name less well known than some of

  zh: '**欧内斯特·博因香奈儿5号而闻名于世，这是世界上最著名的香水。但他本人仍然默默无闻，名气不如香奈儿内的其他一些名人：斯特拉文斯基、迪亚吉列夫和尼金斯基等。**'
- en: Beaux was born in Moscow on the seventh of December 1881, one of eight children
    by two marriages. His parents were French expatriates and the children grew up
    to speak French and Russian fluently.

  zh: 博于1881年12月7日出生在莫斯科，是两次婚姻中的八个孩子之一。他的父母是法国侨民，孩子们从小就能流利地讲法语和俄语。
- en: At that time, perfumers often came from Grasse – where their family had contacts
    in the industry. Beaux was not a Grassois but he was almost as lucky. His brother
    Édouard, who was eighteen years older than him, worked at Rallet – a large perfume
    and soap maker in Moscow. Rallet was a prestigious company that supplied toiletries
    to the Tsar and other European royals, and so was an ideal springboard for a young
    perfumer.

  zh: 当时，香水制造商通常来自格拉斯（Grasse），他们的家族在这个行业有联系。博是个例外，但他几乎同样幸运。他的哥哥埃德华比他大18岁，在莫斯科的Rallet工作，这是一家大型香水和肥皂制造商。Rallet是一家供应洗浴用品给沙皇和其他欧洲皇室的著名公司，因此对年轻的香水制造商来说是一个理想的跳板。
- en: Édouard had already become managing director by the time Ernest joined the company
    so young Beaux’ path to the top was assured. Rallet was then owned by Chiris,
    the perfume supplier from Grasse, so, unlike François Coty, who had to travel
    to Grasse to learn his trade, Grasse came to Beaux. Ernest started at Rallet in
    the soap division, and he finished as director of perfumery.

  zh: 埃德华在欧内斯特加入公司时已经成为总经理，所以年轻的博的成功之路可以说是一帆风顺。当时，Rallet属于格拉斯的香水供应商Chiris，因此，不像弗朗索瓦·科蒂（François
    Coty）那样不得不前往格拉斯学习他的手艺，格拉斯却来到了博身边。欧内斯特从事肥皂部门的工作开始，最终成为香水部门的主任。
- en: In the book Son Parfum by his grand daughter Nathalie Beaux, Ernest is described
    as being intransigent. She writes how, once he rose to authority, Ernest became
    so hated by his workers they talked about throwing him in a vat of boiling soap.
    Luckily, Édouard was a diplomatic soul and would smooth things over when his brother
    got into trouble.

- en: When the First World War broke out in 1914, Beaux went to France and enlisted
    as an artillery officer. His unit of Breton gunners was posted to Russia, possibly
    the Kola peninsula, which is near the lakes of Murmansk in the Arctic circle.
    The time he spent there was a foundational experience for Beaux, one that he would
    draw on later in his career.

  zh: 第一次世界大战爆发时，博前往法国并作为炮兵军官参战。他所在的勃列塔尼炮兵部队被派往俄国，可能是科拉半岛，靠近位于北极圈的摩尔曼斯克湖。他在那里度过的时光成为了博后来职业生涯中的基础经验。
- en: Being a trained chemist, Beaux was soon recalled to France and given the mission
    of setting up a chemical weapons factory. One day there was an explosion in the
    production facility and Beaux was exposed to Cloropicrin, a poison gas. He was
    immediately rushed to hospital where he remained for two months. When he recovered,
    he could have accepted a medical discharge but he volunteered to go back, and
    returned to the fighting in Russia.

- en: After the Communist revolution of 1917, a Bolshevik army was mustered in Ukraine
    and laid siege to Kiev. In December of that year Beaux was given another special
    assignment, this time of a secret nature. His job was to enter the Ukrainian capital
    and remove all sensitive materials from the British and French embassies. This
    was not armed conflict but was nonetheless extremely dangerous. Nathalie Beaux
    writes that Ernest's car was hit by bullets on his way to the capital, but he
    and a colleague still managed to reach their destination where their task was
    to burn the embassies' documents, bury the caches of weapons, and organise the
    removal of White Russians and western agents from the encircled city.

  zh: 在1917年的共产主义革命后，一支布尔什维克军队在乌克兰集结并围攻了基辅。在那年的12月，博克斯被交予另一个秘密任务，这次是一项特别的任务。他的工作是进入乌克兰首都，从英国和法国大使馆中移除所有敏感材料。虽然这不是武装冲突，但仍然极其危险。娜塔莉·博克斯写道，欧内斯特的汽车在前往首都的途中被子弹击中，但他和一位同事仍然成功抵达目的地，他们的任务是烧毁大使馆的文件，埋藏武器的储藏处，并组织白俄和西方特工离开被围困的城市。
- en: Russian counter intelligence soon became aware of Beaux' presence in Kiev and
    put a bounty on the head of this French 'liaison officer'. As a consequence he
    had to work in disguise, frequently changing residence and assuming different
    identities. It was surely thanks to his fluent Russian that Beaux managed to remain
    undetected for three months, and, after completing his mission, he escaped Kiev
    and reported back to French Military Intelligence.

- en: When Beaux was thirty he married a Russian of German extraction, Ida Schönaich,
    who was eighteen at the time. Nathalie comments that 'besides a magnetic attraction
    – one for the other – they had nothing in common'. Beaux was refined and urbane,
    an art lover who enjoyed the ballet and concerts. By contrast, Ida was out of
    her depths in polite society, and – especially after the birth of their son Mitya
    – preferred to stay at home. If it wasn't already a dysfunctional union, when
    her beloved 'Nestia' returned from the war – damaged psychologically by what he
    had seen and done – it became evident to both parties there was no future for
    them together, and they began to drift apart.

  zh: 博克斯三十岁时娶了一位德国裔俄罗斯女子伊达·舒奈希，当时她只有十八岁。娜塔莉评论道：“除了一种磁性吸引力，他们俩一无所有共同点。” 博克斯文雅且城市化，是一位艺术爱好者，喜欢芭蕾舞和音乐会。相比之下，伊达在上流社会中显得不自在，特别是在他们的儿子米特亚出生后，更愿意呆在家里。如果说这本来就是一段不和谐的关系，那么当她心爱的“内斯蒂亚”因战争看到和经历的事情而心理受创后，双方都明白他们在一起没有未来，他们开始渐行渐远。
- en: While Beaux was in Ukraine, his Moscow apartment had been requisitioned by the
    Bolsheviks, and when Ida went there looking for him, she found the locks changed
    and someone else living there. She stayed long enough to gather up some documents
    and family photos, and then left – never to return. Because he and Ida had lost
    touch, when Ernest arrived in Moscow he was unaware of the situation with his
    apartment and was shocked to be told by the new occupants that he had no rights
    to his property, and he should leave before they called the commissar.

- en: Back on active service in Russia, Beaux was put in charge of a multinational
    raiding party. They were sent up-river on a commando-style mission to seize an
    outpost of the Red army, which they achieved after several days of skirmishing.
    Going through captured documents, Beaux realised a large force of Red Guards had
    been alerted and would soon arrive, so he ordered a hasty withdrawal and he and
    his unit returned to Allied lines with valuable intelligence.

- en: For his actions Beaux was decorated with the Cross of Saint Vladimir by the
    White Russian government, and the British Military Cross. More significantly,
    he was transferred to a new role, this time in Archangel, the port city on the
    Arctic coast. He was assigned to Mudyug Island, where the so called Interventionist

- en: Beaux’ role was to interrogate the prisoners and determine who were Bolshevik
    or revolutionary sympathisers, and who were White loyalists or merely innocents
    caught up in the chaos. Some 'ordinary' prisoners were given their freedom – in
    return for serving in a White Russian battalion, but those thought to be partisans
    had a much worse fate. The authorities had at their disposal open air Ice Cells,

    best sellers. This is not without reason. It has benefited from highly successful
    marketing but it is, without doubt, a wonderful perfume; audacious, but lush and
    perfectly composed, rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It would be hard to overestimate
    its influence on the history of western perfumery. Although it wasn't the first
    aldehydic bouquet – that was Quelques Fleurs, which Beaux had studied closely
    – N°5 is often thought to be the founding work of the genre. For many people it
    is *the* aldehydic, in the sense that Shalimar is the Mother of all Ambers (the
    genre once known as Oriental).

  zh: N°5不仅是世界上最著名的香水之一，而且仍然是最畅销的香水之一。这并非没有原因。它得益于极其成功的营销，但毫无疑问，它是一款美妙的香水；大胆而丰富，完美而协调，被公认为杰作。难以估量它对西方香水历史的影响。虽然它不是第一个醛花香调的香水——那个是Beaux密切研究过的Quelques
    Fleurs——但N°5通常被认为是这一流派的奠基作品。对许多人来说，它是*那个*醛花香调，就像Shalimar是所有琥珀香调（曾被称为东方调）的鼻祖一样。
- en: There is an apocryphal story that Chanel N°5 was the result of a compounding
    error; an assistant used pure aldehydes rather than the 10% prescribed. But Beaux
    insisted the overdose was intentional and it was inspired by the Arctic, where
    – according to an article in Perfumer & Flavorist – the midnight sun releases
    ‘an extremely fresh scent from the lakes’.

  zh: 有一个流传不实的故事称香奈儿N°5是化合物错误的结果；一位助手使用了纯度高的醛类而非预定的10%。但Beaux坚称这种过量是有意的，灵感来自北极，根据《Perfumer
    & Flavorist》上的一篇文章，午夜太阳释放了“湖泊中极其清新的香气”。
- en: In Son Parfum, his grand daughter wrote how Ernest felt 'he could – and must
    – create his perfume based on the odours [of] the High North'. But more than that,
    his perfume was charged with memories of Ida – and her ‘palest of blue eyes’.
    For Beaux, creating perfume was 'a way to make sense of the years of separation,
    of violence and death, and above all the terrible silence’ that he experienced
    in Siberia.

- en: She also says that Beaux – who was a keen experimenter – wanted to make a perfume
    using new materials which 'could come from nature, *or* from science'. As it turned

- en: When Parfums Chanel was sold to the Wertheimer brothers – who owned the cosmetics
    and perfume house Bourjois, Beaux became head perfumer for both companies. During
    this time he created Bourjois' best known work Soir de Paris (1928). Unfortunately,
    this has been reformulated and has little to do with the work of Beaux. There
    still exist other Bourjois perfumes by him though, of which one is Flamme (1932).
    It opens with an unusual green bergamot and hyacinth, and possibly violet leaf,
    but underneath it’s a woody aldehydic and soft-rose bouquet; rather like a budget
    N°5.

    de Paris（1928年）。不幸的是，这款香水已经进行了重新配方，与贝乌斯的作品关系不大。然而，仍然存在其他他为Bourjois设计的香水，其中之一是Flamme（1932年）。它以不寻常的绿色佛手柑、风信子和可能的紫罗兰叶开头，但其下层则是木质醛类和柔和的玫瑰花香；有点像一个廉价的N°5。
- en: By the 1940's, Coco Chanel was becoming more and more unhappy with the 10% of
    the profit she received from Parfums Chanel and as a result she decided to release
    her own perfumes under the brand name Mademoiselle Chanel. It's not clear if this
    was a serious venture, or just a bargaining chip to use against her business partners,

- en: One way to find out who was behind MC N°1 would be by chemical analysis, and
    in 2007 the results of a GCMS of the juice were published in an article by Perfumer

- en: The article goes on to note that the aldehyde cocktail in N°5 was replaced by
    a whopping 25% of *a*-n-methyl ionone, and so, Mademoiselle Chanel N°1 becomes
    'a violet – orris modification of the Chanel N°5 theme'. The main difference being
    the aldehydes are replaced by another synthetic molecule.

- en: '*a*-n-methyl ionone was ''a novel material in the 1940''s, just as the aldehydes
    [were] in the 1910''s''; an innovation which is in keeping with Beaux’ stated
    enthusiasm for new materials. Even though a 25% overdose was an audacious and

- en: Another argument to support the idea that MC N°1 was the work of Beaux is the
    assertion that *a*-n-methyl ionone – at the time an unusual and hard to find molecule
    – would have been available to him in the form of Raldeine A, a captive of Givaudan,

    the use of an overdose of a novel material ... bear Beaux' signature’. In the
    light of this, Perfumeprojects.com concludes; Mademoiselle Chanel N°1 is ‘difficult
