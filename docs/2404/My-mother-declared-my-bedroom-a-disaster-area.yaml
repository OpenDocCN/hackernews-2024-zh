    Reprinted by kind permission of the Reagan Library. The picture of Ronald Reagan
    peering into a child’s messy bedroom—which I’m now realising, as I type, is mildly
    sinister?—is in fact, believe it or not, two photos mashed together. Both are
    from Getty who I’m sure won’t mind.*'

    each month during his presidency; a mailbag so voluminous, in fact, that a gang
    of patient volunteers were tasked with opening them all on his behalf and passing
    him approximately 30 each week to read and respond to. Letters arrived from all
    over the world, written by a diverse group of people: men, women, fans, critics,
    average Joes, celebrities, world leaders, and, marking a moment in history, a
    letter from a 13-year-old boy from South Carolina named Andy Smith, written exactly
    40 years ago on 18 April 1984\.'

    federal funds to hire a crew to clean up my room. I am prepared to provide the
    initial funds if you will provide matching funds for this project.

    one technical problem: the authority declaring the disaster is supposed to make
    the request. In this case, your mother.'

    funds. This has been a year of disasters: 539 hurricanes as of May 4th and several
    more since, numerous floods, forest fires, drought in Texas and a number of earthquakes.
    What I’m getting at is that funds are dangerously low.'

    done many things that could better be done by volunteers at the local level, has
    sponsored a Private Sector Initiative Program, calling upon people to practice
    voluntarism in the solving of a number of local problems.

    in proclaiming your room a disaster. Therefore, you are in an excellent position
    to launch another volunteer program to go along with the more than 3000 already
    underway in our nation. Congratulations.
