    in the wake of devastating wars fought over religion. It was catalysed by powerful
    arguments from thinkers such as John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Pierre Bayle and Voltaire.
    These philosophers and political theorists responded to the brutality of the religious

    et Critique* (1697), Bayle pointed out that if one religion claimed to be the
    only true faith, it by implication possessed the right to persecute all the others,
    and all other faiths possessed an equal right to make such a claim. Showing the
    inherent volatility, for society, of such religious-truth claims, Bayle also argued
    that if people turned out to be mistaken about their religion, they could hardly
    be guilty of sin for nonetheless trying, in their sincerity, to observe its dictates.

    还论证说，如果人们对他们的宗教持错误观念，那么尽管在诚意中尝试遵守其教义，他们也不应该因此而被定罪。

    recently completed the book *Persecution and Toleration* (2018), in which we show

    ability of states to create and enforce rules – to make religious freedom in the
    West possible and appealing. It wasn’t the ideas of Bayle or Spinoza or Locke
    driving the rise of state power, it was the need to raise resources for governing

    and jurisdictions. These were not ‘states’ in the modern sense. Rulers were expected
    only to enforce existing ‘laws of the land’, not to pass new laws. Usually, no
    taxes were raised – in normal times, rulers lived off the proceeds of their own
    lands. Armies were not permanent but rather raised in an ad hoc manner as needed.

    religious freedom. In his early works, such as the *Open Letter to the Christian
    Nobility* (1520), he acknowledged the right of any believer to his own private
    judgment, and argued against the compulsion of religious belief. But Luther’s
    position changed. The Peasants War of 1524-25 was the proximate cause of this
    change. He opposed religious freedom for Anabaptists, and then condemned the followers
    of his fellow reformer Huldrych Zwingli in Switzerland. Luther’s internal battles
    over religious freedom and those of his contemporaries suggest that powerful forces
    were at work that seemed to necessitate religious compulsion. He came to believe

    full equality, but represented a radical change in the way in which Jews had been
    treated. The impetus towards emancipation came less from commitment to the principle
    of religious equality than from a recognition that maintaining the old reliance
    on identity rules imposed considerable economic and political costs. Joseph II
    was persuaded by the writings of Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, who had argued that
    the existing regulations hemmed in Jewish life, making Jewish people unproductive
    as citizens and as workers. Freeing the Jews from discriminatory laws, he argued,
    would bolster the economy.

  zh: 犹太人解放案例提供了一个重要的例子，说明历史上宗教自由是如何实现的。1782年，哈布斯堡皇帝约瑟夫二世发布了大陆欧洲犹太人宽容法令之一。该法案在条件为将犹太人作为活跃公民与其他人口整合的前提下，授予了犹太人某些公民权利。尽管未能完全提供犹太人平等的待遇，但却代表了对犹太人待遇方式的激进改变。解放的推动力量来自于对宗教平等原则的承诺较少，而更多地来自于意识到维持旧有身份规则会带来相当的经济和政治成本的认识。约瑟夫二世被克里斯蒂安·威廉·冯·多姆的著作所说服，后者认为现行法规限制了犹太人的生活，使其作为公民和工作者缺乏生产力。他认为，解除歧视性法律对经济会有所促进。
- en: Joseph’s reforms were controversial. But Revolutionary France adopted a similar
    policy, and soon exported it to much of the rest of Europe. The results of this
    transformation were dramatic. Previously, Jews had been excluded from most industries
    and professions; they were barred from the universities, from law, and from guild
    membership. As a result, Jews had been largely confined to trades such as moneylending
    and peddling, and the majority of central European Jews lived in ghettos, and
    were poor and impoverished. After emancipation, this changed within a generation.
    Jews entered higher education, industry and commerce on a large scale.

  zh: 约瑟夫的改革引起了争议。但是，法国大革命采纳了类似的政策，并很快将其输出到欧洲的大部分地区。这一转变的结果是显著的。以前，犹太人被排除在大多数行业和职业之外；他们不能进入大学、从事法律工作或加入行业组织。因此，大多数中欧犹太人生活在贫困的贫民窟中，生活困苦。解放后，这种情况在一代人之内发生了变化。犹太人大规模进入高等教育、工业和商业。
- en: This increase in religious freedom also transformed Europe’s cultural and intellectual
    life. Between the Middle Ages and the modern era, Jewish intellectual culture
    had in many ways fallen behind that of Christian Europe – notwithstanding the
    occasional exceptional genius such as Spinoza or Moses Mendelssohn. The emancipation
    of Europe’s Jewish community gave rise to a tremendous flourishing of intellectual
    and artistic achievement among Jews that greatly enriched European society.

  zh: 宗教自由的增加也转变了欧洲的文化和知识生活。在中世纪和现代之间，犹太人的知识文化在许多方面落后于基督教欧洲——尽管有时会出现斯宾诺莎或莫西斯·门德尔松等个别卓越天才。欧洲犹太社区的解放引发了犹太人在智力和艺术成就方面的巨大蓬勃发展，极大丰富了欧洲社会。

- en: Economic changes complemented the rise of religious freedom, most notably the
    onset of modern economic growth. As in the Jewish example, greater freedom allowed
    religious minorities to flourish. French Protestants expelled by Louis XIV brought
    with them advanced skills and industrial expertise to England, the Netherlands
    and Prussia. In Industrial Revolution Britain, Quakers and other religious dissenters
    were overrepresented among businessmen, entrepreneurs and innovators.

  zh: 经济变革与宗教自由的崛起相辅相成，尤其是现代经济增长的开始。就像犹太人的例子一样，更大的自由使宗教少数群体得以蓬勃发展。被路易十四驱逐的法国新教徒将先进技术和工业专业知识带到了英格兰、荷兰和普鲁士。在工业革命的英国，贵格会教徒和其他宗教异议者在商人、企业家和创新者中所占比例较高。
- en: The indirect consequences of moving from identity rules to general rules were
    even more important. Identity rules had limited the scope of trade and the division
    of labour. As these identity rules were removed – as guilds lost authority, and
    cities and lords lost their ability to charge internal tariffs – trade and commerce
    expanded.

  zh: 从身份规则转向普遍规则的间接后果更为重要。身份规则限制了贸易和劳动分工的范围。随着这些身份规则的废除——如行会失去权威，城市和领主失去征收内部关税的能力——贸易和商业得以扩展。
- en: The growth of trade, in turn, reinforced the trend towards liberalism. Trade,
    as Enlightenment thinkers such as Montesquieu argued, encouraged individuals to
    see the world through the positive-sum lens of mutual beneficial interaction rather
    than through the zero-sum lens of conflict. Religious freedom began to seem less
    like a recipe for social disorder and civil war, and more like a win-win proposition.

  zh: 贸易的增长反过来又加强了自由主义的趋势。正如启蒙时代的思想家们如孟德斯鸠所主张的那样，贸易鼓励个人通过互利的积极和解争的零和视角来看待世界。宗教自由开始看起来不再像是社会紊乱和内战的导火索，而更像是一个双赢的建议。
- en: What implications does our argument have for the modern world? Most important
    perhaps is the need to recognise that liberal ideas were not necessarily responsible
    for the emergence of liberal societies. Instead, the rise of a new type of political
    organisation, the modern state, led, for its own reasons, to rulers enforcing
    general rules of behaviour – rules incompatible with religious discrimination.

  zh: 我们的论点对现代世界有什么影响？也许最重要的是需要认识到，自由主义思想并不一定是自由主义社会出现的原因。相反，现代国家这种新型政治组织的兴起，出于其自身的原因，导致统治者强制执行行为的普遍规则——这些规则与宗教歧视不相容。
- en: Protestants often see the Reformation as explaining the origins of religious
    freedom. But the example of Calvin and Castellio suggests that Protestantism itself
    did not point the way to religious freedom. American national mythology often
    attributes the origins of religious freedom to the Puritans who fled persecution
    in England and settled in New England. But the Puritans believed in religious
    freedom only for Puritans; they were stricter enforcers of religious conformity
    than many European states. The actual adoption of any meaningful practice of religious
    freedom followed neither from the arguments of philosophers, nor from the nature
    of Protestant belief, but from the political impossibility of achieving conformity
    after 1600 as Protestantism grew more and more sectarian.

  zh: 抗议者通常将宗教改革视为解释宗教自由起源的依据。但卡尔文和卡斯泰利奥的例子表明，新教本身并没有指向宗教自由的方向。美国的国家神话常常将宗教自由的起源归因于逃离英格兰迫害并在新英格兰定居的清教徒。但清教徒只为清教徒主张宗教自由；他们比许多欧洲国家更严格地强制宗教一致性。任何有意义的宗教自由实践的实际采纳既不是哲学家的论点的结果，也不是新教信仰的本质，而是1600年后新教分裂愈加深入，达成一致的政治不可能性的结果。
- en: Finally, the history of how religious freedom came to be is a reminder that
    commitment to liberal values alone is not enough for liberalism to flourish. It
    requires a suitable political and economic foundation. As the experience of 1930s
    Germany suggests, religious persecution can quickly re-emerge. We cannot rely
    on liberal ideas alone to be effective. If we value religious freedom, and other
    achievements of liberalism, we must look to the vitality of their institutional
    foundations.

  zh: 最后，宗教自由如何形成的历史提醒我们，单靠对自由主义价值的承诺是不足以让自由主义蓬勃发展的。它需要适当的政治和经济基础。正如1930年代德国的经验表明，宗教迫害可以迅速再次出现。如果我们重视宗教自由和自由主义的其他成就，我们必须关注其制度基础的活力。
