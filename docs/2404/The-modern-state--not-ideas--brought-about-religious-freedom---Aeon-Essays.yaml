    and championed by politicians and thinkers across the political spectrum, it is

    in the wake of devastating wars fought over religion. It was catalysed by powerful
    arguments from thinkers such as John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Pierre Bayle and Voltaire.
    These philosophers and political theorists responded to the brutality of the religious
    wars with support for radical notions of toleration and religious freedom. Their
    liberal ideals then became embedded in the political institutions of the West,
    following the American and French Revolutions.

    et Critique* (1697), Bayle pointed out that if one religion claimed to be the
    only true faith, it by implication possessed the right to persecute all the others,
    and all other faiths possessed an equal right to make such a claim. Showing the
    inherent volatility, for society, of such religious-truth claims, Bayle also argued
    that if people turned out to be mistaken about their religion, they could hardly
    be guilty of sin for nonetheless trying, in their sincerity, to observe its dictates.

    and institutional changes – specifically, the growth and strengthening of the
    ability of states to create and enforce rules – to make religious freedom in the
    West possible and appealing. It wasn’t the ideas of Bayle or Spinoza or Locke
    driving the rise of state power, it was the need to raise resources for governing

    lands. Armies were not permanent but rather raised in an ad hoc manner as needed.

    Nobility* (1520), he acknowledged the right of any believer to his own private
    judgment, and argued against the compulsion of religious belief. But Luther’s
    position changed. The Peasants War of 1524-25 was the proximate cause of this
    change. He opposed religious freedom for Anabaptists, and then condemned the followers
    of his fellow reformer Huldrych Zwingli in Switzerland. Luther’s internal battles
    over religious freedom and those of his contemporaries suggest that powerful forces
    were at work that seemed to necessitate religious compulsion. He came to believe

    granted certain civic rights to Jews on the proviso that they be integrated with
    the rest of the population as active citizens. It stopped short of offering Jews
    full equality, but represented a radical change in the way in which Jews had been
    treated. The impetus towards emancipation came less from commitment to the principle
    of religious equality than from a recognition that maintaining the old reliance
    on identity rules imposed considerable economic and political costs. Joseph II
    was persuaded by the writings of Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, who had argued that
    the existing regulations hemmed in Jewish life, making Jewish people unproductive
    as citizens and as workers. Freeing the Jews from discriminatory laws, he argued,
    would bolster the economy.
