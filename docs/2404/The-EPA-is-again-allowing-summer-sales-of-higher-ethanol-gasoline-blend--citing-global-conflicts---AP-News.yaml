- en: OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency cleared the way Friday
    for a [higher blend of ethanol](https://apnews.com/article/ethanol-e15-gas-midwest-ba37597f6d1880e31d94180a13299e35)
    to be sold nationwide for the third summer in a row, citing global conflicts that
    it says are putting pressure on the world’s fuel supply.

    15% ethanol from an existing [summertime ban](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-business-smog-environment-4a877e9afc2837609c4a0aee72a042bc).
    Gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold nationwide, but the higher blend has
    been prohibited in the summer because of concerns it could worsen smog during
    warm weather.

    unjustified, unprovoked, and unconscionable war against Ukraine” and the ongoing
    conflict in the Middle East, which he said are putting pressure on the global
    fuel supply. He said the diminished U.S. refining capacity is also a factor.

    is produced from corn praised the EPA’s decision. They have portrayed ethanol
    as a product that helps farmers, reduces prices at the pump and lessens greenhouse
    gases because the fuel burns more cleanly than gasoline.

    can increase carbon releases because it results in more corn production, leading
    to increased use of fertilizer and greater releases of nitrate. Synthetic and
    natural fertilizers also are a leading source of water pollution.
