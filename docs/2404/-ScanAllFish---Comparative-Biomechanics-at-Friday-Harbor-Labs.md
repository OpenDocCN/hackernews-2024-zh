### CT scanner

This project uses a mini CT-scanner, which is different than the full-size donut scanners used in hospitals. By creating a "fish burrito", we can scan many fish at the same time, and it will only take only a few years to scan all the fishes in the world at our current rate thanks to our novel approach to scanning.
