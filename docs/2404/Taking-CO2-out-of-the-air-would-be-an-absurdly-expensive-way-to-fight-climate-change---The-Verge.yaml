    impact on climate change would require hundreds of billions of dollars in government
    spending, according to a new [report](https://rhg.com/research/carbon-dioxide-removal-us-policy/).

    called carbon dioxide removal, or CDR. It’s still [risky and astronomically expensive](https://www.eli.org/sites/default/files/files-pdf/Dont%20Bet%20on%20Carbon%20Removal.pdf).
    But there’s been [growing chatter](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/31/climate/climate-change-carbon-capture-ccs.html?ref=oembed)
    about it, particularly as the US continues producing record amounts of [oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545#:~:text=Crude%20oil%20production%20in%20the,%2Fd%2C%20set%20in%202019.)

    spend roughly $100 billion a year on CDR in order to scale up to a level that
    would help the country meet its climate goals. A majority of that needs to come
    in the form of supportive policies like tax credits and procurement programs.

    incentives — the nation’s largest climate investment to date. So $100 billion
    of government spending annually, as the report recommends, is a lot to spend on
    novel technologies that have yet to prove themselves at scale and potentially
    still not enough to make this strategy effective. It’s a big gamble, with the
    livability of our planet as we know it on the line.

    Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/)
    — is to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 2050\. That’s what’s
    needed to stop global average temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius higher
    than they were before the Industrial Revolution.

    perhaps surpassing humans’ ability to adapt to these changes in the most vulnerable
    parts of the world. That 1.5-degree target was set in the Paris agreement nearly
    a decade ago in 2015 — but [greenhouse gas emissions are still climbing](https://research.noaa.gov/2024/04/05/no-sign-of-greenhouse-gases-increases-slowing-in-2023/).

    the only way to stop climate change and meet goals set under the Paris agreement
    is to stop depending on fossil fuels. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes
    $3.5 billion to build new [carbon removal hubs](/2023/8/14/23831268/carbon-removal-climate-change-biden-funding-energy-department)

    net-zero goals, the report says. It’s an enormous amount of carbon dioxide to
    capture, equivalent to roughly 20 percent of the nation’s carbon footprint. The
    country’s capacity to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere is tiny in comparison
    now — in the low single-digit megatons so far.

    of the atmosphere: natural methods that rely on plants, soil, and the ocean to
    absorb CO2; building machines that capture carbon dioxide; and hybrid technologies
    that employ both natural and engineered processes. All three strategies pose their
    own challenges.'

    The trees often don’t survive long enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric
    CO2, for example, and then there’s double counting when more than one group claims
    the carbon credits.'

    be better at keeping track of the amount of CO2 they trap. But the enormous amount
    of energy they use makes these devices inefficient and exorbitantly expensive.
    It costs upward of $600 to filter a ton of CO2 out of the air. Multiply that by
    a gigaton (a billion metric tons) and you get to hundreds of billions of dollars
    of spending.

    these technologies could cost, according to Joseph Romm, senior research fellow

    ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

    and stopping putting more CO2 into the air,” he says. Once that’s happening, then
    it could be worth it to stretch resources toward carbon dioxide removal that tackles
    our historic emissions. But why put a Band-Aid on the problem if we aren’t stopping
    the bleeding?
