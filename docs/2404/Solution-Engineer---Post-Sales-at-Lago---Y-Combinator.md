### Our Values

*   Ambition: we aim big, because otherwise, where is the fun?
*   Progress: we care more about the grit, the steep learning curve, the resilience and creativity muscles, than the current status or where you come from.
*   Humble confidence: we know our strengths and always strive for excellence, but we also know there‚Äôs so much we don‚Äôt know yet
*   Pay it forward: we‚Äôve all started somewhere, people gave us a hand when we needed one, we don‚Äôt forget this, and reinforce this positive cycle
*   Not taking ourselves too seriously: we are ambitious, restless learners and hustlers, but at the end of the day, our health (physical and mental), and our loved ones are what matter the most.
