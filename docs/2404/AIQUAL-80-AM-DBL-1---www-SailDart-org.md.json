There are a number of different\ndimensions along which we could divide up the material.  The attempt in\nthe earlier version to establish a thorough categorization has been\nreplaced this year with a less formal, more realistic organization.  We\nhave listed a number of \"topics\" with a short paragraph describing the\nnecessary reading for each.  These topics overlap in various ways, and\nreflect idiosyncratic views of how things divide up without any attempt to\nprovide a consistent classification. Hopefully the set of references\nincluded with each item will make it possible for students to select a\nreasonable number of readings which will fill any knowledge gaps.  The\nlong reading list is intended as a source of details on individual\nreferences, not as a necessary set of things to read.  It includes a rough\nindication of what sort of understanding is most important for each\nreference -- whether there is a general perspective, one or more specific\nconcepts, and/or a body of detail with which students are expected to be\nfluent.  These indications are of course based on the prejudices and\npeculiarities of the committee making up the syllabus, and should not be\ntaken as representing the views of anyone else (including the members of\nindividual exam committees).\n\nPlease send any comments or suggestions on the syllabus to\nDoug Lenat (LENAT@SUMEX).\nWe are hoping to get lots of feedback, and continue building toward\na syllabus which really describes what there is to know [and what\nis important to know] about AI, to be built on year after year.\n.sec |Mechanics of the Examination|\n\nThe examination will be an individually-scheduled oral, before a\ncommittee consisting of three members, chosen from the faculty,\nadjunct faculty, senior research staff, and possibly appropriate\nsenior researchers from AI facilities in the area like SRI and Xerox\nPARC.  Each committee will include at least one faculty member and at\nleast one person in a potential area of specialization of the\ncandidate.  The candidate can request a particular person in his or\nher area, but the Qual committee has final choice of examining\ncommittees.   We plan to hold the examinations during the first\ntwo weeks of June.  If there are special reasons why someone cannot\ntake it at that time, we will try to make other arrangements.\n\nAt least two weeks before a student's examination, he or she will be \ngiven either:  (i) a problem to be worked on an open-book basis; or (ii)\na research paper on which he or she will write a critique.\nThose students who prepared papers for the qual last year, but\ndid not pass the oral exam can use the same papers as the basis\nfor this year's exam if they wish.  The papers are to be\nhanded in to the qual committee (Doug Lenat or Terry Winograd)\nno later than one week before the exam.  The members of the individual exam\ncommittee will be given copies of the solution or paper, and the first section\nof the exam (up to an hour) will center around issues raised by the\nwork done.  The rest of the exam will be on any\nquestions the examiners consider appropriate. \nThe purpose of the exam is to demonstrate that the student has done\nsufficient reading and thinking to fit his or her individual research\ninto a perspective of other work in AI.  This includes detailed\nknowledge of some other existing work, both in the sub-area in which\nthe student intends to do research, and in other sub-areas.  The\ncommittee should be satisfied that the student already has a\nsufficient grasp of both the general issues and of a reasonable\namount of technical detail.\nIt would be unwise to assume that it is only necessary to know\na subset of the topics listed below by matching them to the\nindividual examiners.  The purpose of the exam is to look for bredth,\nnot for conformity to the particular committee, and questions from\nall areas are fair game.\nThe exam is not intended as a device to\ndecide who will and will not be able to continue in the program, but\nrather a way of focussing effort on a comprehensive study of AI, and a way of\nproviding students with specific diagnostics for gaps in their\nknowledge or understanding.  The possible outcomes of the exam are:\n\n.crown (5,10,5)\nPass unconditionally: The student has a satisfactory knowledge of all\nareas.\n\nPass conditionally: The student has some lacks which can be made up\nby directed work, such as the completion of specific course(s) or\nspecific research project(s).  The committee will set both the scope\nof the work and a time period in which it must be completed in order\nfor the examination to count as passed. \n\nContinuation of the examination: The student has a lack which demands\na moderate amount of further study in one or more areas, and a second\noral examination (with the same committee) will be scheduled within\nthe next two quarters. \n\nDefer: The student has significant gaps in knowledge which cannot be\nmade up by limited correctives.  Candidate is required to take the\nexam another time it is offered, under whatever system is in effect\nthen. \n.endcrown\n\n.ss |Topics to be studied|\n\nAs mentioned above, this is not intended as a complete or structured\nclassification.  It is a list of answers to the vague question \"What\nkinds of things should AI students know about?\".  There is no significance\nto the ordering.\n.stoptext\n\n\tGeneral Perspective\n\tWeak Methods\n\tEpistemological problems of AI and the use of formal logic\n\tKnowledge Engineering - Expert Systems\n\tKnowledge Representation Formalisms\n\tGame Playing\n\tPlanning and Common-sense Reasoning\n\tMathematical theorem proving and discovery\n\tNatural Language\n\tSpeech understanding\n\tVision\n\tPhysical manipulation\n\tAutomatic Programming and Program Verification\n\tLearning and Inductive Inference\n\tPsychological Models\n\tAutomata and Formal Language Theory\n\tProgramming Languages for AI\n\tPhilosophical Implications\n\tPolitical and Social Implications\n\tHistory and politics of the field\n.starttext\n.SS |General Perspective|\n\nThere are several recent books on AI which attempt to provide an\noverview.   Of these, [Boden AI] and [Winston AI] are the best\nstarting point. One recent book ([McCorduck AI]) detailes the early history \nand sociology of the field.\nShorter articles which provide long-term perspective\nare [Minsky STEPS], [Feigenbaum IFIP], [Lenat UBIQ], and [Nilsson OVERVIEW].\nIn addition, the AI handbook will provide an overview of lots\nof AI issues. [Nilsson AI2] is now available, and its novel organization cuts\nacross most of the categories on our list above.\n\n.SS |Weak Methods|\n\nClassicaly, AI has been associated with a set of methods for \nproblem solving and search which have been called \"weak methods\".\nThese include early work such as GPS [Newell, Shaw, and Simon],\nnotions of heuristic search as described in [Nilsson\nAI] and [Handbook SEARCH], and more theoretical ideas abot\nproblem spaces discussed in [Newell ILL] and at length in\n[Newell & Simon HPS].  Students are expected to be familiar enough\nwith the technical details to demonstrate how the techniques\noperate, but will not be asked to prove theorems or remember complex\nresults.\n\n.SS |Epistemological problems of AI and the use of formal logic|\n\nThe problem of describing facts about the world including the effects\nof actions has been studied apart from specific problem solving\nprograms.  This work has used first order logic to express facts\nabout the world.  These issues are discussed in [McCarthy and Hayes]\nand in [Hayes DEFENCE].  Many current issues are discussed in [McCarthy\n5IJCAI].  A new approach is described in [Weyrauch PROLEGOMENA].\nTruth maintenance is covered by de Kleer, Doyle, and others in\n[Winston & Brown].  The relevance of theorem proving to problem\nsolving is discussed in [Green TP], and the techniques of\nresolution theorem proving are described in [Nilsson AI].  As\nwith weak methods, students are expected to be familiar with\nthe basic mechanisms (e.g. be able to demonstrate a simple proof\nby resolution, or explain the issues in unification) but\nwill not be required to know sophisticated technical results\n(e.g. prove the completeness of resolution with the X heuristic).\nA tutorial on some of the relevant mathematics is in [Manna MTC].\n\n.SS |Knowledge Engineering - Expert Systems|\n\nMuch of current AI work is being subsumed under the heading of \"knowledge\nengineering\".  [Bernstein KBS] is a general survey of knowledge based\nsystems.  [Winston AI] gives a general idea of systems of this kind done\nat MIT, and [Feigenbaum IJCAI5] describes the general approach.  A number\nof expert systems have been built in the past few years.  Students should\nbe familiar with the general capabilities and design.  \n[Handbook APPLICATIONS] provides some details (and many pointers) for most\nof the recent efforts.  Applications to Music [Moorer][Zaripov] and Art\n[Gips][Cohen IJCAI6] should also be looked over.  The MIT perspective is\ncovered in [Winston & Brown], V.1, Sec.1.\n\n.ss |Knowledge Representation Formalisms|\n\nA number of current AI research projects are centered around the\ndevelopment of knowledge representation languages.  Some of the early\nissues in representation are discussed in [Amarel ACTIONS] and [Bobrow\nDIMENSIONS].  More recent discussions include [Winograd FRAME], [Hayes\nDEFENCE], and [Winograd EXTENDED].  Students should be familiar with at\nleast the following general approaches: Procedural Embedding,\nSemantic Networks, Conceptual Dependency, Frames (Scripts, etc.),\nProduction Systems,  and Description Languages.\nThese are treated well in [Handbook REPRESENTATION].\n\n.ss |Game Playing|\n\nOne of the earliest and most publicized areas of AI research has been game\nplaying programs, such as those for checkers [Samuel in C&T] and Chess\n[Greenblatt FJCC].  Students should be familiar with the basic techniques\n(e.g. Minimax and alpha-beta) and some of the more subtle problems (e.g.\nthe horizon effect [Berliner IJCAI3] and the use of patterns [Simon\n1973]).  Berliner's articles in IJCAI5 and IJCAI6 also merit attention.\nBasic techniques are taught in [Nilsson AI] and [Slagle AI].\n\n.ss |Planning and Common-sense Reasoning|\n\nMuch of the AI work related to robotics dealt with the planning of action\nsequences.  GPS [Newell, Shaw and Simon] was the early classic, and other\nwell known systems are STRIPS [Fikes, Hart, Nilsson] and NOAH [Sacerdoti\nNONLINEAR].  An early discussion of the problems is in [McCarthy\nADVICE-TAKER].\n\n.ss |Mathematical theorem proving and discovery|\n\nMathematics has always been an important domain for AI.  The Geometry\ntheorem prover [Gelernter] was an early program.  More recent efforts in\nmathematical theorem proving are discussed in [Bledsoe MAN-MACHINE].  The\nmechanization of mathematical discovery is discussed in [Lenat IJCAI5].\nNon-Computer Science treatments of some interest are [Polya] and [Lakatos].\n\n.ss |Natural Language|\n\nMuch of the research on natural language is summarized in the handbook\narticles [Handbook NL] and the drafts of [Winograd LANGUAGE].  Students\nshould be aware of the general content of these and familiar with the\nissues which arise in parsing and reasoning with natural language.  This\nincludes a level of understanding of parsing techniques (CFG, ATN, TG,\netc.) similar to that of heuristic search and theorem proving discussed in\nsections above.  Early work in NL is described in [Simmons SURVEY 1965]\n[Simmons SURVEY 1970], [Minsky SIP (browse)], and [Weizenbaum ELIZA].\n[Handbook NL] gives a summary of work in Machine Translation.  Many papers\nreflecting current research interests are found in [TINLAP] 1 and 2.\n\n.ss |Speech understanding|\n\nWork in Speech systems is well summarized in [Handbook SPEECH].\n\n.ss |Vision|\n\n[Winston VISION] contains a good introduction to some areas of scene analysis.\n[Winston & Brown], V2, Sec1, present more recent MIT vision efforts,\nnotably Marr's work on representation.\n[Waltz] presents work on analysis of line drawings.\n[Thomas and Binford] give an early comparison of machine perception and natural\nperception.\n[Nevatia and Binford] describe recognition of complex objects.\n[Moravec], [Gennery], and [Marr and Poggio] deal with stereo vision.\n[Brooks, Greiner, and Binford] present a model-based vision system.\n[Barrow & Tenenbaum] describe their efforts at SRI.\n[Land] describes color visual perception.\n\n.ss |Physical manipulation|\n\nStanford AI films make a good introduction to robotics.  \n[Bolles and Paul] describe the first computer-controlled assembly.\n[Finkel, Bolles, and Taylor] present AL, the Stanford language\nfor mechanical assembly.  [Lieberman] gives a description of a\nvery high level language for robotics.\n[Binford et al] give an overview of robotics at Stanford.\n[IJCAI6] contains many brief articles which give a picture of current\nJapanese projects and achievements (unfortuanately, said picture could\nstand some image enhancement, and we refrain from recommending any\nparticular articles.)\n\n.ss |Automatic Programming and Program Verification|\n\nThere has been work in AI devoted to automating the process of\nwriting programs.  Some surveys of the field are given in [Biermann APPROACHES]\n[Green-INFORMAL], and in the last section of [Manna and Waldinger DREAMS].\nAlso see [Handbook AP] for a detailed, up-to-date survey.\nApproaches range from formal theorem-proving techniques [Manna and\nWaldinger DEDUCTIVE] to knowledge-based systems [Green IJCAI5] to systems \nthat attempt to simulate human reasoning [Lenat BEINGS], \n[Shrobe MONOLOGUE].  Students should\nbe familiar with these approaches, but do not need to know the details of\nany particular system.\n\nA closely related area is program verification -- ascertaining that a\nprogram does, indeed, do what it is supposed to. Some perspectives on\ncurrent verification research and discussion of opportunities for\nextension are found in [Gerhart-1980s].  Other surveys of the field of\nverification are [Luckham PV & VOP] and [London PERSPECTIVES].\n\n.ss |Learning and Inductive Inference|\n\nMuch of the work in AI can be view as an effort to get a program to\n'learn' -- typically, to view a set of examples, and induce the common\nconcept uniting them.  An excellent survey of this work is in [Smith et al\nIJCAI5].  Winston [STRUCTURAL] provided a seminal contribution,\nemphasizing both the necessity for adequate description, and the use of\nnegative examples to more precisely circumscribe the concept desired.\nStudents should be familiar with these papers, and with the issues\ninvolved.  They should also understand the application of learning\ntechniques to various domains (e.g., [Buchanan THEORY-FORMATION], [Fikes\net al GENERALIZED], [Sussman SKILL]), but need not know the technical\ndetails of all these cases.\n\n.ss |Psychological Models and Human Problem Solving|\n\nMany AI programs have been intended as models of human information\nprocessing.  Information processing psychology in general is described in\n[Newell and Simon HPS (Sections 1 and 5 especially)].  An early program\nwhich modelled human verbal behavior was [Feigenbaum EPAM].  More recent\nmodels are found in [Anderson & Bower HAM (chapters 4 and 7)],\n[Norman & Rumelhart EXPLORATIONS], and [Collins & Quillian USER].  A\nfamous early program which took one form of intelligence tests was [Evans\nANALOGY], and a controversial model of paranoia is described in [Colby\nSIMULATIONS].  Relevant classics from psychology include [Bartlett\nREMEMBERING] and [Miller MAGICAL].  Some good books on human problem solving\nare those by Wickelgren, Polya, and Lakatos; see also [Sloman AIJ].  Students\nshould be familiar with (at least) the first and last chapters of\n[Newell&Simon HPS].\n\n.ss |Automata and Formal Language Theory|\n\nAlthough this is not AI per se, it forms an important part of the\nbackground. Relevant work is in [Minsky COMPUTATION], [Manna MTC] and the\nmaterial on perceptrons in [Hunt AI] (extra detail in [Minsky & Papert\nPERCEPTRONS]).\n\n.ss |Programming Languages for AI|\n.stoptext\n\n\tList Processing -- LISP\n\tString processing -- SNOBOL\n\tAssociative mechanisms -- LEAP/SAIL\n\tActive data structures -- SIMULA/SMALLTALK/ACTORS\n\tPattern Matching\t\t[Bobrow & Raphael]\n\tData Structures\t\t\t[Knuth Vol.I]\n\tPLANNER, CONNIVER, QA4, etc.\t[Bobrow & Raphael]\n\tProduction Systems\t\t[Davis & King OVERVIEW]\n\n.starttext\n\nThe candidate is expected to be familiar enough with some AI language (e.g.\nLISP or SAIL) to demonstrate the ability to write simple programs.  He or she\nshould also know enough about the features of the more specialized languages\n(MicroPlanner, QA4, the LEAP and multiple process features in SAIL)\nto discuss\nthe kinds of problems for which they are useful, and the limitations they\nforce the programmer into.  It is not necessary\nto know syntactic details of these features.\n\n.ss |Note:|\n\nLast year there was some controversy about including the following topics\non the reading list.  McCarthy stated,\n\"I think the syllabus should downplay philosophical and social issues,\nbecause the we certainly don't want to grade students on their own\nviews, and the field is fluffy enough as it is without letting or\nrequiring students to be able to regurgitate various people's views\non the issues.  If the faculty wants students to have exposure to\nthese issues it should require attendance at a seminar or lecture\nseries and take attendance but not examine.\"\nWinograd said, \"The purpose of the qualifying examinations is to ensure\nthat students graduating from our department have a sufficient background\nto work as qualified researchers and teachers in the field.  I believe that\na perspctive on what we are doing and why is a critical part of the needed\nbackground, and that it would be irresponsible for us as a teaching institution\nto leave it out.  Since our general philosophy is to judge competence in all\nareas by exams rather than required courses, this is no different.  Indeed\nnobody is expected to endorse or regurgitate anyone's views, but (as in\nall areas) to demonstrate that they are aware of the important issues and have\nthought about them.\"\n\n.ss |Philosophical Implications|\n\nThere has been a continuing discussion about the philosophical implications\nof intelligent machines.  The original paper often cited is\n[Turing TEST].  The classical book criticizing AI from a philsophical\npoint of view is [Dreyfus CAN'T].  Many of the general\nissues are discussed in the fascinating [Anderson MINDS] and\nin [Dennett BRAINSTORMS].  There is an accessible discussion of the issue in\n[Boden AI].  A recent controversy dealing with AI and the philosophy\nof science is in [Dresher & Hornstein SUPPOSED], [Winograd CONTESTED],\nand [Dresher and Hornstein RESPONSE].  [Sloman REVOLUTION] is a new \nimportant reference (JMC has a copy and the library\nhas one).  [Hofstater GODEL] is bizarre, whimsical, at times provocative, and\nat times informative.\n\n.ss |Political and Social Implications|\n\nOne of the pioneers in the field discussed these issues in [Weiner HUMAN],\nand more recently there has been a discussion raised by [Weizenbaum\nREASON], and responses like [Buchanan, Lederberg, and McCarthy REVIEWS].\n[Boden AI] also discusses some\nof the important questions.  [Firschein & Coles IJCAI3 survey] attempts to\npredict some of the future applications of AI.  An important controversy\nin British support for AI is in [Lighthill AI] and responses in the same\nbooklet and in [McCarthy LIGHTHILL].\n\n.ss |History and Politics of the Field|\n\nA critical part of being able to do and evaluate research in a field\nis having some perspective on what things have been done and why --\nin particular, what lessons have been learned and how can they\nbe applied to keep from repeating mistakes.  In addition, students\nneed to know where and how things are published in the field if\nthey hope to keep up with current work.  It is difficult to give specific\nreferences, but the general books on AI [e.g. Boden, Winston, McCorduck,\nRaphael] each give some perspective.  It is also critical to look at\nsome of the early collections of papers, including a\ncareful reading of most of [Feigenbaum & Feldman].\n\nStudents should have some familiarity with the early\nhistory of AI -- its connections to cybernetics and machine translation in\nthe 50's.  It is interesting to note some of the early optimistic attempts\nat \"self-organizing systems\" and work on perceptrons and neural nets.\nToday, there is much discussion about the emergence of a discipline called\n\"cognitive science\" which includes work now considered artificial\nintelligence, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy.  Students should\nhave done some thinking about the relationships between these disciplines,\nespecially where they adopt differing methodologies in looking at the same\nphenomena.  \n\nThe following journals (and conferences) present material relevant to \nAI, and it is useful to have a general idea of what kinds of things each \nof them contains. Given a paper, you should be able to discuss where it \nought (not) to be submitted.\n.stoptext\n\n\tJournal of AI\n\tSIGART \n\tSIGCAS \n\tMachine Intelligence (1 - 9)\n\tIJCAI proceedings (1 - 6)\n\tTINLAP proceedings (1 - 2)\n\tCACM \n\tJACM \n\tCognitive Psychology \n\tAmerican Journal of Computational Linguistics\n\tCognitive Science Journal\n\tCognitive Science Society\n\tThe Behavioral & Brain Sciences\n\tAAAI\n\tAISB\n\tSpecial interest conferences: cybernetics, natural language, \n\t\trobotics\n\n.starttext\n\n.sec |Readings|\n.ss |Explanation:|\n\nThe following list is NOT a list of required readings, but a\nguide to interesting, available materials in each subfield.\nSome of the papers are not yet published but will be made\navailable.\n\nA simple annotation system has been used to give some feeling for the\nlevel and importance (measured idiosyncratically by the syllabus\npreparers) of each paper.  The level is indicated as:\n\n.stoptext\n\n\tESS:  An essay giving general perspective and discussion of basic \n\t        issues\n\tSURV: A survey of research work in some area\n\tSUM:  A summary at a non-detailed level of a specific piece of \n\t        research\n\tDR:   A detailed research report\n\tTEXT: A textbook\n\n.starttext\n\nThe importance is based on whether the paper is important for\nunderstanding a general perspective (P), whether it has one or\nmore specific important ideas (I), or whether it gives a set of\ndetails over which students are expected to have fluent command (D).\nWe repeat: these are opinions, hastily arrived at! \n\nA basic background can be acquired via the books marked \"@@\"; gaps\nmay be filled with those papers marked \"@\".  These together can\nbe thought of as an initial reading list.\n\nMany of the references below point to more specialized sources for those\nhighly interested; it is expected that each candidate will be highly \ninterested in some areas (hint).  We also hope that each student will \nhave  only a few gaps (at study-time, not at exam-time) and it will be \npossible to glance over the outline, choosing to read in those areas \nwhere the references pointed to are not familiar.\n\n.ss |References|\n.crown (3,0,0)\n.skip 1\n\nAdams, J. <<Conceptual Blockbusting>, W.H.Freeman.\n\n@Agin, G. and Binford, T.
