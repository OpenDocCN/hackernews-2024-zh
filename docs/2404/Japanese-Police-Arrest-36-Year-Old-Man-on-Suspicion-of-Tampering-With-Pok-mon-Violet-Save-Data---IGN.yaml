    Freak’s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon card
    heist saw one desperate man [attempt to descend from a six-story building in order
    to steal a treasure trove of trading cards](/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist?_gl=1*17zenfa*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg2MzE0MTUzOC4xNzEyODUwNTk0*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxMjg1MDU5My4xLjAuMTcxMjg1MDU5My4wLjAuMA..)

    high-value Pokemon burglaries, [including one instance in which theives made off
    with a haul of cards worth over $60,000](/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan).
    Its worth noting that the raw last for Pokemon — and the trouble it can land you
    in — is felt well beyond the criminal fraternity. As a case in point January 2022
    saw two Los Angeles police officers fired [after they ignored a call to attend
    a burglary in order to chase down a Snorlax](/articles/lapd-officers-fired-for-chasing-snorlax-in-pokemon-go-instead-of-robbers)
