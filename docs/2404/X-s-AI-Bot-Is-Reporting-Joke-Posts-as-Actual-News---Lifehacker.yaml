    AI bot. Part of that privilege includes access to a trending news feed in the
    Explore tab powered by the company's artificial intelligence. The only issue?
    It's garbage.

- en: 'Here''s how Grok''s trending news feed seems to work: The bot pulls together
    the "top" posts concerning any given news story, then generates a summary of the
    news from those posts. Simple enough, and something that we''ve seen generative
    AI do before. But before you fire your human writers and editors and put Grok
    in charge of the news, you might want to see *how* exactly it''s reporting works.'

    answer as genuine news. You can see that from [this post shared by X user BrettRedacted](https://x.com/BrettRedacted/status/1776323701148930404
    "(opens in a new window)") following the [earthquake that shook much of the New
    York City metro area](https://mashable.com/article/nj-ny-earthquake-april-5-reactions
    "(opens in a new window)"). The bot generated the headline: "Adams vs. Earthquake:
    50,000 Cops in Subway Showdown," then reports how New York City Mayor Eric Adams
    is deploying the NYPD to "prevent further earthquakes," considering using "robo
    cops," and has ordered "every cop in the city" to "shoot the damn earthquake before
    it strikes again."'

    Grok's summary of the news was accurate. If you somehow couldn't decide for yourself,
    you could take a look at the top posts fueling that news summary, which in this
    case, are all joke tweets about the mayor's response to the earthquake.

    of the site would have been *the* place to be to follow both legitimate updates
    on breaking news like the NYC earthquake, and laugh at the jokes about the situation.
    Now, the site treats the jokes as news. You get what you pay for, I guess.

- en: It doesn't take much foresight to imagine how this situation goes from sad but
    humorous to simply dangerous. What happens when Grok decides to "report" on something
    that seems at first glance legitimate, but is based on the [rampant misinformation
    spreading across the site](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/us/politics/elon-musk-election-misinformation-x-twitter.html
    "(opens in a new window)")? An X user may check into the Explore page to see that
    their city is being bombed, or that a candidate in their election did something
    illegal, when neither "story" is actually true.

    agree to not treat Grok, or any generate AI for that matter, as a legitimate news
    source, or an accurate summarizer of the day's top stories.
