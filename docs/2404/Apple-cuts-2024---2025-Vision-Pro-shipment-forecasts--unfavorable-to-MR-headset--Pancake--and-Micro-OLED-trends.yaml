    of 700–800k units or more).

- en: Apple cut orders before launching Vision Pro in non-US markets, which means
    that demand in the US market has fallen sharply beyond expectations, making Apple
    take a conservative view of demand in non-US markets.

- en: Apple is reviewing and adjusting its head-mounted display (HMD) product roadmap,
    so there may be no new Vision Pro model in 2025 (the previous expectation was
    that there would be a new model in 2H25/4Q25). Apple now expects Vision Pro shipments
    to decline YoY in 2025.

- en: '**MR headset devices.** The challenge for Vision Pro is to address the lack
    of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through
    user experience. In contrast, VR is also a niche market, but at least there are
    proven successful applications (games), and trend visibility is better than MR.'

- en: '**Pancake.** As the upgrade of optical specifications for smartphones has slowed
    down for several years, investors expect Pancake, which has a significantly higher
    unit price than lenses, to become a new growth driver for the optical sector.
    Weaker-than-expected shipments of Vision Pro will lower Pancake’s contribution
    to the optical industry in the foreseeable future than investors’ expectations.'

- en: '**Micro OLED.** Vision Pro/MR headset is the most critical application of Micro
    OLED. With key applications not growing as expected, the timeframe of mass production
    and adoption of Micro OLEDs in other small-sized consumer electronics devices
    will be delayed.'
