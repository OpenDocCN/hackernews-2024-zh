    that demand in the US market has fallen sharply beyond expectations, making Apple
    take a conservative view of demand in non-US markets.

- en: Apple is reviewing and adjusting its head-mounted display (HMD) product roadmap,
    so there may be no new Vision Pro model in 2025 (the previous expectation was
    that there would be a new model in 2H25/4Q25). Apple now expects Vision Pro shipments
    to decline YoY in 2025.

    of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through
    user experience. In contrast, VR is also a niche market, but at least there are
    proven successful applications (games), and trend visibility is better than MR.'

    down for several years, investors expect Pancake, which has a significantly higher
    unit price than lenses, to become a new growth driver for the optical sector.
    Weaker-than-expected shipments of Vision Pro will lower Pancake’s contribution
    to the optical industry in the foreseeable future than investors’ expectations.'

    OLED. With key applications not growing as expected, the timeframe of mass production
    and adoption of Micro OLEDs in other small-sized consumer electronics devices
    will be delayed.'
