    the bourbon. Bourbon's mash bill, as noted above, must be at least 51% corn, although
    in practice, bourbons are made from 60–86% corn. The other grains used in bourbon
    are generally rye, wheat, and barley. Most distillers use only two of those three—either
    rye and barley, or wheat and barley.

    but others include **W.L. Weller** and **Old Fitzgerald**. I doubt I'm the only
    one who started drinking bourbon by drinking wheaters, before moving on to more
    rye-forward bottlings. (A whiskey such as **Bernheim Wheat Whiskey**, incidentally,
    is a different beast; Bernheim is 51% wheat, with the remaining grains a mix of
    corn and barley. In other words, it ain't bourbon.)

    in most bourbons, a bit of mash from a previous distillation is added, to form
    a sour mash. (More on this in a bit.) New yeast is added, and the mixture is then
    fermented, before being moved off to a column still, also known as a continuous
    still or a Coffey still. Bourbon by law can't be distilled higher than 160 proof
    (80% ABV) but in practice, most bourbon is distilled out to between 130 and 160

    character of the spirit. Climate plays a major role; as temperatures increase,
    whiskey expands, and the staves of the oak barrels absorb some of that volume;
    cold weather causes whiskey to contract back out of the staves. This movement
    of whiskey into and out of the staves gives whiskey tannins, an amber color, and
    a woody flavor. In warmer years, the whiskey will spend more time absorbed into
    the staves and pick up more tannins, color, and oak flavor; bourbon therefore
    ages faster in warmer years.

    ages. Because hot air rises, temperatures on the top floor are generally higher

  id: totrans-split-41

    of previously used mash and adding it to a fresh batch. This makes the mash taste
    a bit sour, hence the name, but it doesn't make the resulting whiskey taste sour.
  id: totrans-split-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantages of this process are twofold, and they're all about the yeast.
    First, the sour-mash process creates a consistent environment for yeast from batch
    to batch, which means each new batch of whiskey is consistent with the last. This
    is one reason your favorite bourbon tastes the same from bottle to bottle. It
    also lowers the pH of the batch, which helps the yeasts in the batch ferment the
    mash more efficiently, boosting a higher yield of alcohol.
  id: totrans-split-43
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few distilleries (**Woodford Reserve**, for example) have experimented with
    a similar process, called **sweet mash**. The difference here is that only fresh
    yeast is added to the mash; no "sour" yeasts are added from a previous batch.
    This may seem a minor difference, but the higher pH in the mash means that the
    mash ferments differently than in a sour mash, creating congeners you don't find
    in sour mash, meaning the resulting whiskey simply tastes different than a sour
    mash bourbon. Woodford's sweet mash, for example, is said to have more berry flavors
    than its sour-mash cousin.

    and settlers starting in 1750, nearly 40 years earlier than the Hooch Uprising.

    was a vital need for western expansion. The whiskey-making settlement of Kentucky

    aged in charred oak barrels. Kentucky's settlers already knew how to distill.
    The practice was used for both rum and rye in the colonies, and settlers brought
    the technology with them into Kentucky. The practice of aging spirits in charred
    oak was also well known in the 19th century, when bourbon first arose, so using
    charred barrels was a logical choice. Using corn was also logical; it was simply
    the most abundant grain in the area, and farmers found it more efficient and lucrative
    to haul whiskey to market rather than raw corn. So if you have knowledge of distillation
    and aging, and you have ample supplies of raw grain, bourbon whiskey almost invents
    itself. Who created bourbon? It really could have been anyone.

    are in a bind here: on the one hand, European consumers demand the use of non-GMO
    ingredients; on the other, non-GMO farming in this country is dwindling fast,
    vastly reducing the amount of non-GMO corn available on the market.'

    article offers two organic, non-GMO choices, and to my palate at least, both are
    excellent-tasting options: **Four Roses** and **Wild Turkey**. But even the master
    distillers at those brands express pessimism that they''ll be able to hew to the
    non-GMO standard in the future.'
