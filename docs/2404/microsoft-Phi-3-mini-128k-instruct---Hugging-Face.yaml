- en: The Phi-3-Mini-128K-Instruct is a 3.8 billion-parameter, lightweight, state-of-the-art
    open model trained using the Phi-3 datasets. This dataset includes both synthetic
    data and filtered publicly available website data, with an emphasis on high-quality
    and reasoning-dense properties. The model belongs to the Phi-3 family with the
    Mini version in two variants [4K](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct)
    and [128K](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct) which is
    the context length (in tokens) that it can support.

    supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to enhance its ability
    to follow instructions and adhere to safety measures. When evaluated against benchmarks
    that test common sense, language understanding, mathematics, coding, long-term
    context, and logical reasoning, the Phi-3 Mini-128K-Instruct demonstrated robust
    and state-of-the-art performance among models with fewer than 13 billion parameters.
