- en: The [Interop project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop#the-interop-project)
    is a benchmark and test suite that tracks the interoperability of web features
    across different browsers. However, Interop is more than tests; it is a joint
    initiative among browser vendors to identify important features that would benefit
    from consistency across browsers and drive development toward them over a calendar
    year.

- en: Over the last three years, developers have worked together to increase overall
    Interop benchmark scores. Like previous years, the [Interop 2024](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024)
    dashboard shows the features that browser vendors have agreed to work on collectively
    and the progress in web feature compatibility scores across different browsers.

    web experiences for everyone, regardless of their browser choice. When developers
    can build upon a consistent web platform, everyone who uses the web benefits from
    it in their daily online activities.

- en: A key benefit of the web platform is that it's defined by standards, rather
    than by the code of a single implementation. This creates a shared platform that
    isn't tied to specific hardware, a company, or a business model. - [Interop 2022
