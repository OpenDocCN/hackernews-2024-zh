- en: A few months into the third millennium, a group called the International Geosphere-Biosphere
    Programme (I.G.B.P.) held a meeting in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Among the researchers
    in attendance was Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist best known for his research
    on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons. For this work, Crutzen,
    a Dutchman living in Germany, had received a Nobel Prize, in 1995\. In his Nobel
    lecture, he noted that, given humanity’s heedlessness, it had got off lightly.
    Millions of pounds of CFCs had been released into the air before anyone had considered
    the possible consequences. As a result of the chemicals’ behavior in the stratosphere,
    a “hole” had opened up in the ozone layer over Antarctica. But, if CFCs had turned
    out to behave just slightly differently, the hole would have stretched from pole
    to pole before scientists had even had the tools to measure it.

    His colleagues kept referring to the Holocene, the geological epoch that began
    at the close of the last ice age, about twelve thousand years ago. At the dawn
    of the Holocene, the global population was maybe four million—barely enough to
    fill a city like Sydney or St. Petersburg. By the time of the meeting in Mexico,
    there were more than six billion people on the planet, and human activity was
    fundamentally altering such basic Earth processes as the carbon cycle.

  zh: 在墨西哥Cuernavaca的IGBP会议上，克鲁岑发现自己变得焦躁不安。他的同事们一直在提到全新世，这是在大约一万二千年前最后一次冰河时代结束时开始的地质时期。在全新世曙光初现时，全球人口可能只有四百万，勉强足够填满悉尼或圣彼得堡这样的城市。到墨西哥会议时，地球上的人口已经超过六十亿，并且人类活动正根本性地改变碳循环等基本地球过程。
- en: “Stop using the word ‘Holocene,’ ” Crutzen blurted out. “We’re not in the Holocene
    any more. We’re in the . . . ” He paused, searching for the right word. “We’re
    in the Anthropocene!” During the next coffee break, Crutzen’s neologism was the
    main topic of conversation. Someone suggested that he copyright the term.

  zh: “停止使用‘全新世’这个词，” 克鲁岑突然说道。“我们已经不在全新世了。我们进入了……”他停顿了一下，寻找合适的词。“我们进入了人类世！”在接下来的咖啡休息时间里，克鲁岑的新词成为了主要讨论话题。有人建议他注册该术语的版权。
- en: As it turned out, the Anthropocene wasn’t Crutzen’s to claim. Eugene Stoermer,
    a biologist at the University of Michigan, had coined the word back in the nineteen-eighties,
    out of much the same frustration. Crutzen got in touch with Stoermer, and the
    two wrote an essay for the I.G.B.P. newsletter, laying out their case for a new
    age. Human activities, the pair argued, were altering the planet faster and more
    dramatically than the geological forces that had shaped it for most of its history.

  zh: 后来事实证明，人类世并不是克鲁岑可以宣称的。密歇根大学的生物学家尤金·斯托默在八十年代早些时候就创造了这个词，出于几乎相同的沮丧。克鲁岑与斯托默联系并共同为IGBP通讯撰写了一篇文章，阐述了他们提出新时代的论点。他们认为，人类活动正在比大部分地质力量更快速和更显著地改变地球。
- en: '“It seems to us more than appropriate to emphasize the central role of mankind”
    by using “the term ‘anthropocene’ for the current geological epoch,” the pair
    wrote. Not many people read the I.G.B.P. newsletter, so in 2002 Crutzen refashioned
    the essay for the journal *Nature*. He listed some of the ways that humans were
    altering the planet: chopping down rain forests, messing with the climate, and
    manufacturing novel chemicals, such as CFCs. Once again, Crutzen stressed how
    fortunate humanity had been so far. Had the ozone layer sustained more damage,
    large parts of the world could have been rendered uninhabitable. “More by luck
    than by wisdom, this catastrophic situation did not develop,” he observed.'

  zh: “通过使用‘人类世’这个术语来强调人类的中心作用，似乎对我们来说更加合适”，他们写道。没有多少人读过I.G.B.P.的通讯，因此克鲁岑在2002年为《自然》杂志重新撰写了这篇文章。他列举了人类改变地球的几种方式：砍伐热带雨林，干扰气候，并制造新的化学物质，如CFC。克鲁岑再次强调到目前为止人类多么幸运。如果臭氧层受到更多破坏，世界上的大部分地区可能已经变得不适宜居住。“这种灾难性的情况未能发展，更多的是依靠运气而非智慧”，他观察到。
- en: Many researchers found Crutzen and Stoermer’s term useful. Soon the word “Anthropocene”
    began popping up in scientific papers. This, in turn, piqued the interest of stratigraphers—the
    subset of geologists who maintain the planet’s official timetable, the International
    Chronostratigraphic Chart. Had the Earth really entered a new epoch, in the stratigraphic
    sense of the term? And, if so, when? The International Commission on Stratigraphy
    (I.C.S.) set up the Anthropocene Working Group (A.W.G.) to look into the matter.
    It was still working away last month, when, in a vote that one group member described
    to me as “Putinesque,” a subcommittee of the I.C.S. decided against adding the
    Anthropocene to the timetable. The vote might have marked the end of the story,
    were it not that it was probably just the beginning. As another geologist put
    it to me, “Voting down the Anthropocene is a bit like trying to vote down plate
    tectonics. It’s real, it’s there, and we are going to have to deal with it.”

  zh: 许多研究人员发现克鲁岑和斯托默的术语很有用。不久，"人类世"一词开始出现在科学论文中。这反过来引起了地层学家的兴趣——这是地质学家的一个子集，他们维护地球的官方时间表，即国际年代地层图。地球是否真的进入了一个新的世代，从地层学的角度来看？如果是这样，是在什么时候？国际地层委员会（I.C.S.）成立了人类世工作组（A.W.G.）来研究这个问题。上个月仍在继续工作时，国际地层委员会的一个小组委员会在一次投票中决定不将人类世列入时间表中，其中一名小组成员将这次投票形容为“普京式的”。这次投票可能标志着故事的结束，但这可能只是开始。正如另一位地质学家对我说的：“否决人类世有点像试图否决板块构造论。它是真实存在的，我们必须面对它。”
- en: Stratigraphers are used to thinking in vast stretches of time. The International
    Chronostratigraphic Chart starts with the Hadean eon, which began with the birth
    of the planet, 4.5 billion years ago. The Hadean lasted five hundred million years
    and was succeeded by the Archean eon, which went on (and on and on) for 1.5 billion
    years. The Permian period spanned nearly fifty million years, the Cretaceous period
    eighty million. Within these periods there were many sub-periods—technically known
    as epochs—which also lasted a long time. The Cisuralian epoch of the Permian,
    for example, stretched over twenty-six million years.

  zh: 地层学家习惯于以漫长的时间跨度进行思考。国际年代地层图始于哈迪安宙，即地球诞生的45亿年前。哈迪安宙长达5亿年，随后是始太古宙，持续了15亿年（还在继续）。二叠纪时期长达近五千万年，白垩纪则长达八千万年。在这些时期内，还有许多子时期，技术上称为世，同样时间漫长。例如，二叠纪的石炭世时期延续了2600万年。
- en: But, the closer the chart gets to the present, the narrower the divisions become.
    The second most recent geological period, the Neogene, lasted just twenty million
    years. The current period, the Quaternary, began with the start of the ice ages,
    a mere 2.58 million years ago. The Quaternary is further divided into two epochs—the
    Pleistocene, which spanned 2.57 million years, and the Holocene, which, for now,
    is still ongoing.

  zh: 但是，地层图越接近现在，划分就越细。倒数第二个地质时期新近纪只持续了两千万年。当前时期第四纪始于冰河时代的开始，仅有258万年前。第四纪进一步分为两个世代——更新世持续了257万年，全新世则目前仍在进行中。
- en: To mark the boundaries between the various epochs and periods, the I.C.S. relies
    on what are formally called “global boundary stratotype sections and points” and
    informally known as “golden spikes.” For the most part, golden spikes are layers
    of rock that contain evidence of some notable shift in Earth’s history—a reversal
    of the planet’s magnetic poles, say, or the disappearance of a fossilized species.
    The golden spike for the start of the Triassic period, for example, is a layer
    of rock found in Meishan, China, and the shift it records is a mass extinction
    that killed off something like ninety per cent of all species on Earth. (The Chinese
    have set up a park in Meishan, where visitors can view the two-hundred-and-fifty-million-year-old
    rock layer in an exposed cliffside.) With golden spikes, again, the closer you
    get to the present, the more the present intrudes. In the case of the Holocene,
    the golden spike is a layer in an ice core from Greenland that’s stored in a freezer
    in Copenhagen. The layer consists of the compressed remains of snow that fell
    eleven thousand seven hundred years ago, which corresponds to the end of a cold
    snap known as the Younger Dryas.

  zh: 为了标志各个地质时代和地质年代之间的界限，国际地层委员会依赖于正式称为“全球界线地层型和地点”的东西，通俗称为“黄金尖峰”。大多数情况下，黄金尖峰是包含了地球历史上某些显著变化证据的岩石层，比如地球磁极的反转，或化石物种的消失。例如，三叠纪开始的黄金尖峰是在中国的梅山发现的一层岩石，它记录了一次灭绝事件，导致地球上大约90%的物种灭绝。（中国已在梅山建立了一个公园，游客可以在露出的悬崖上观看两亿五千万年前的岩层。）再次强调，越接近现在，现在就越显著。就全新世而言，黄金尖峰是格陵兰岛的冰芯中的一层，存放在哥本哈根的冰箱里。这一层由一万一千七百年前下落的雪的压缩遗骸组成，这段时间对应于被称为幼发拉底冷期的寒冷时段的结束。
- en: With the exception of the Holocene, the start dates for geological ages have
    been determined millions of years after the fact. This means that whatever signal
    is being used to set them has withstood the test of time. The rocks of the Anthropocene,
    of course, do not yet exist. When the Anthropocene Working Group was formed, in
    2009, its first task was to decide whether human impacts on the planet would still
    be discernible millions of years from now.

- en: After several years of study, the group decided that the answer was yes. The
    carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels will leave a permanent signature in
    the rocks of the future, as will the fallout from nuclear testing. Novel ecosystems
    that people have created by moving plants and animals around the world will produce
    novel fossil assemblages. Meanwhile, traces of some of the trillions of tons of
    stuff humans have generated, from transistors to tanker ships, will be preserved,
    meaning that a whole new class of fossils will appear in the record—so-called
    technofossils. Before aluminum smelting was invented, in the nineteenth century,
    aluminum existed on Earth only in combination with other elements. Future geologists
    will thus be able to distinguish the current epoch via the remains of beer cans—the
    Bud Light layer.

    rejected it. In the decades following the Second World War, resource consumption
    skyrocketed—a development that’s become known as the Great Acceleration. The fantastic
    growth in the production of new materials such as aluminum and plastic, the group
    decided, made a date closer to 1950 a more logical starting point for the new
    epoch.

    as meromictic, which means that its top and bottom waters don’t mix. As a result
    of this and other unusual qualities, everything that falls into the lake, from
    pollen grains to radioactive particles, gets preserved in layers of sediment that
    can be very precisely dated. The idea was to designate the base of the Anthropocene
    as the layer of Crawford Lake sediment laid down in 1952—and, more specifically,
    as the 1952 layer preserved in one particular core kept in a freezer in Quebec.
    (The United States conducted the first H-bomb tests in 1952, and the fallout from
    these clearly shows up in the lake bed as a spike in plutonium.) The working group
    announced its choice of the Crawford Lake core while stratigraphers from around
    the world were gathered for a conference in Lille, France. But, in a sign of things
    to come, the group was barred from making the announcement at the conference hall
    and had to rent a room in a nearby hotel.
