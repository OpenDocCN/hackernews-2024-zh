- en: A few months into the third millennium, a group called the International Geosphere-Biosphere
    Programme (I.G.B.P.) held a meeting in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Among the researchers
    in attendance was Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist best known for his research
    on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons. For this work, Crutzen,
    a Dutchman living in Germany, had received a Nobel Prize, in 1995\. In his Nobel
    lecture, he noted that, given humanity’s heedlessness, it had got off lightly.
    Millions of pounds of CFCs had been released into the air before anyone had considered
    the possible consequences. As a result of the chemicals’ behavior in the stratosphere,
    a “hole” had opened up in the ozone layer over Antarctica. But, if CFCs had turned
    out to behave just slightly differently, the hole would have stretched from pole
    to pole before scientists had even had the tools to measure it.

    His colleagues kept referring to the Holocene, the geological epoch that began
    at the close of the last ice age, about twelve thousand years ago. At the dawn
    of the Holocene, the global population was maybe four million—barely enough to
    fill a city like Sydney or St. Petersburg. By the time of the meeting in Mexico,
    there were more than six billion people on the planet, and human activity was
    fundamentally altering such basic Earth processes as the carbon cycle.

    any more. We’re in the . . . ” He paused, searching for the right word. “We’re
    in the Anthropocene!” During the next coffee break, Crutzen’s neologism was the
    main topic of conversation. Someone suggested that he copyright the term.

- en: As it turned out, the Anthropocene wasn’t Crutzen’s to claim. Eugene Stoermer,
    a biologist at the University of Michigan, had coined the word back in the nineteen-eighties,
    out of much the same frustration. Crutzen got in touch with Stoermer, and the
    two wrote an essay for the I.G.B.P. newsletter, laying out their case for a new
    age. Human activities, the pair argued, were altering the planet faster and more
    dramatically than the geological forces that had shaped it for most of its history.

    by using “the term ‘anthropocene’ for the current geological epoch,” the pair
    wrote. Not many people read the I.G.B.P. newsletter, so in 2002 Crutzen refashioned
    the essay for the journal *Nature*. He listed some of the ways that humans were
    altering the planet: chopping down rain forests, messing with the climate, and
    manufacturing novel chemicals, such as CFCs. Once again, Crutzen stressed how
    fortunate humanity had been so far. Had the ozone layer sustained more damage,
    large parts of the world could have been rendered uninhabitable. “More by luck
    than by wisdom, this catastrophic situation did not develop,” he observed.'

- en: Many researchers found Crutzen and Stoermer’s term useful. Soon the word “Anthropocene”
    began popping up in scientific papers. This, in turn, piqued the interest of stratigraphers—the
    subset of geologists who maintain the planet’s official timetable, the International
    Chronostratigraphic Chart. Had the Earth really entered a new epoch, in the stratigraphic
    sense of the term? And, if so, when? The International Commission on Stratigraphy
    (I.C.S.) set up the Anthropocene Working Group (A.W.G.) to look into the matter.
    It was still working away last month, when, in a vote that one group member described
    to me as “Putinesque,” a subcommittee of the I.C.S. decided against adding the
    Anthropocene to the timetable. The vote might have marked the end of the story,
    were it not that it was probably just the beginning. As another geologist put
    it to me, “Voting down the Anthropocene is a bit like trying to vote down plate
    tectonics. It’s real, it’s there, and we are going to have to deal with it.”

    Chronostratigraphic Chart starts with the Hadean eon, which began with the birth
    of the planet, 4.5 billion years ago. The Hadean lasted five hundred million years
    and was succeeded by the Archean eon, which went on (and on and on) for 1.5 billion
    years. The Permian period spanned nearly fifty million years, the Cretaceous period
    eighty million. Within these periods there were many sub-periods—technically known
    as epochs—which also lasted a long time. The Cisuralian epoch of the Permian,
    for example, stretched over twenty-six million years.

    The second most recent geological period, the Neogene, lasted just twenty million
    years. The current period, the Quaternary, began with the start of the ice ages,
    a mere 2.58 million years ago. The Quaternary is further divided into two epochs—the
    Pleistocene, which spanned 2.57 million years, and the Holocene, which, for now,
    is still ongoing.

- en: To mark the boundaries between the various epochs and periods, the I.C.S. relies
    on what are formally called “global boundary stratotype sections and points” and
    informally known as “golden spikes.” For the most part, golden spikes are layers
    of rock that contain evidence of some notable shift in Earth’s history—a reversal
    of the planet’s magnetic poles, say, or the disappearance of a fossilized species.
    The golden spike for the start of the Triassic period, for example, is a layer
    of rock found in Meishan, China, and the shift it records is a mass extinction
    that killed off something like ninety per cent of all species on Earth. (The Chinese
    have set up a park in Meishan, where visitors can view the two-hundred-and-fifty-million-year-old
    rock layer in an exposed cliffside.) With golden spikes, again, the closer you
    get to the present, the more the present intrudes. In the case of the Holocene,
    the golden spike is a layer in an ice core from Greenland that’s stored in a freezer
    in Copenhagen. The layer consists of the compressed remains of snow that fell
    eleven thousand seven hundred years ago, which corresponds to the end of a cold
    snap known as the Younger Dryas.

    been determined millions of years after the fact. This means that whatever signal
    is being used to set them has withstood the test of time. The rocks of the Anthropocene,
    of course, do not yet exist. When the Anthropocene Working Group was formed, in
    2009, its first task was to decide whether human impacts on the planet would still
    be discernible millions of years from now.

- en: After several years of study, the group decided that the answer was yes. The
    carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels will leave a permanent signature in
    the rocks of the future, as will the fallout from nuclear testing. Novel ecosystems
    that people have created by moving plants and animals around the world will produce
    novel fossil assemblages. Meanwhile, traces of some of the trillions of tons of
    stuff humans have generated, from transistors to tanker ships, will be preserved,
    meaning that a whole new class of fossils will appear in the record—so-called
    technofossils. Before aluminum smelting was invented, in the nineteenth century,
    aluminum existed on Earth only in combination with other elements. Future geologists
    will thus be able to distinguish the current epoch via the remains of beer cans—the
    Bud Light layer.

    the formalization of the Anthropocene as a stratigraphic entity,” members of the
    A.W.G. noted in a paper that appeared in *Science* in 2016.

- en: When Crutzen and Stoermer initially proposed the Anthropocene, they suggested
    that it had begun with the first stirrings of the Industrial Revolution, in the
    late eighteenth century. The A.W.G. considered this possibility, but ultimately
    rejected it. In the decades following the Second World War, resource consumption
    skyrocketed—a development that’s become known as the Great Acceleration. The fantastic
    growth in the production of new materials such as aluminum and plastic, the group
    decided, made a date closer to 1950 a more logical starting point for the new
    epoch.

- en: Last summer, under pressure from the International Commission on Stratigraphy
    to finish its work, the A.W.G. announced its proposal for a golden spike. It chose
    a marker similar to the one used for the base of the Holocene, although, in this
    case, the core came not from an ice sheet but from a lake bottom.

- en: Crawford Lake, which is about thirty miles southwest of Toronto, is what’s known
    as meromictic, which means that its top and bottom waters don’t mix. As a result
    of this and other unusual qualities, everything that falls into the lake, from
    pollen grains to radioactive particles, gets preserved in layers of sediment that
    can be very precisely dated. The idea was to designate the base of the Anthropocene
    as the layer of Crawford Lake sediment laid down in 1952—and, more specifically,
    as the 1952 layer preserved in one particular core kept in a freezer in Quebec.
    (The United States conducted the first H-bomb tests in 1952, and the fallout from
    these clearly shows up in the lake bed as a spike in plutonium.) The working group
    announced its choice of the Crawford Lake core while stratigraphers from around
    the world were gathered for a conference in Lille, France. But, in a sign of things
    to come, the group was barred from making the announcement at the conference hall
    and had to rent a room in a nearby hotel.
