- en: LXQt 2.0.0 is based on Qt ≥ 6.6\. For supporting styling and LXQt File Dialog
    with Qt5-based apps, `libqtxdg-3.12.0`, `lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1` and `libfm-qt-1.4.0`
    can be installed alongside their Qt6-based versions in LXQt 2.0.0.

- en: PCManFM-Qt’s desktop module, LXQt Runner and LXQt Desktop Notifications are
    completely ready to be used under Wayland compositors which support the “layer
    shell protocol”, like LabWC, Wayfire, kwin_wayland, Hyprland, Sway,…

- en: Wayland will be the main target for LXQt 2.1.0, as Qt6 was for LXQt 2.0.0\.
    The components which are *not* ready for Wayland yet include ScreenGrab, LXQt
    Global Shortcuts, LXQt Panel’s task-bar and keyboard indicator (but LXQt Panel
    can be used under Wayland without those plugins), some input settings, and settings
    of monitor, power button, and screen locker. However, most Wayland compositors
    have tools that can be used instead of them, such that an LXQt-Wayland session
    is already possible for advanced users.

    “All Applications”, and an improved search.

- en: QTerminal is the only app whose Qt6 port will be released separately – complications
    were encountered due to the removal of legacy encodings from Qt6\. Until then,
    its Qt5 version 1.4.0 could be used.

- en: '**NOTE for Distros:** For having Qt5 styling and Qt5 file dialog with LXQt
    2.0.0, the installable packages of Qt5-based `lxqt-build-tools`, `libqtxdg`, `lxqt-qtplugin`
    and `libfm-qt` may need to be renamed, such that they can be installed in parallel
    with their Qt6 versions. Also, the point release of the Qt5-based `lxqt-qtplugin-1.4.1`
    is needed for a correct Qt5 font setting (see its release note).'

- en: The desktop module is completely ready for Wayland, thanks to `layer-shell-qt6`.
    Now, PCManFM-Qt can give you a real desktop not only with desktop-agnostic X11
    windows managers, but also with Wayland compositors which implement “layer shell
    protocol”, like those based on `wlroots` or KWin. Also, see [Using Desktop under
    Wayland](https://github.com/lxqt/pcmanfm-qt/wiki#using-desktop-under-wayland)
    in Wiki.
