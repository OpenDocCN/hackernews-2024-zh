- en: I'm getting worried about bird flu (aka H5N1 avian influenza). Calling it bird
    flu is a bit of a misnomer now, as recent news makes it clear that it is spreading
    widely in mammals, now including cows. This has been happening for a while now,
    but it's getting widespread enough that the mainstream media is picking up on
    it.

    the world since 2020, prompting authorities on multiple continents to kill poultry
    and other birds by the millions. In the United States alone, more than 90 million
    birds have been culled in a futile attempt to deter the virus.

- en: There has been no stopping H5N1\. Avian flu viruses tend to be picky about their
    hosts, typically sticking to one kind of wild bird. But this one has rapidly infiltrated
    an astonishingly wide array of birds and animals, from squirrels and skunks to
    bottlenose dolphins, polar bears and, most recently, dairy cows.

    it easily transmissible among humans, where it has a mortality rate of at least
    33 percent.

- en: Confirmation of H5N1 infected dairy cattle herds in 8 states. But the FDA report
    yesterday of commerical milk PCR positivity strongly supports that the cattle
    spread is far wider than these 8 states. Important to emphasize that (PCR) is
    testing for remnants of virus, not live virus, which would be unlikely with pasteurization.
    Other tests, assessing potential evidence for any live virus (egg viability and
    culture), are to be reported by the FDA going forward. Limited culture tests are
    all negative to date for any live virus in milk.

    that the initial spillover event from birds to cows may have occurred as early
    as December 2023, months before the first known cases were reported by local officials.
    And, coupled with the discovery of H5N1 in store-bought milk, it’s now looking
    likely that outbreaks are much more widespread than currently tallied.

- en: The major worry with avian influenza strains such as H5N1 is that they could
    someday develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to
    spread easily between humans while also causing severe illness in many. So, the
    longer it’s able to remain in cows, the greater the likelihood that some strains
    will adapt and become better at transmitting between mammals, humans included.

  zh: 诸如H5N1这类禽流感毒株的主要担忧是它们可能在某一天发展出适当的突变组合，使病毒能够在人类之间轻松传播，同时引起许多严重疾病。因此，它在奶牛中的存留时间越长，某些毒株适应和在哺乳动物之间传播的可能性就越大，包括人类在内。
- en: I'm not worried about finding genetic material from the virus in milk (pasteurization
    will kill any live virus), but I wouldn't drink unpasteurized milk (never a good
    idea even without the threat of H5N1). And keep a good stock of N95 masks around,
    even if you aren't using them now.

  zh: 我不担心在牛奶中找到病毒的遗传物质（巴氏杀菌会杀死任何活病毒），但我不会喝未经巴氏杀菌的牛奶（即使没有H5N1的威胁，这也从来不是一个好主意）。即使现在没有使用，也要储备一些好的N95口罩。
