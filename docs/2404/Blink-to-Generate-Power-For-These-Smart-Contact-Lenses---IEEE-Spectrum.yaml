    lens on your eye and monitor health metrics like glucose levels; receive targeted
    drug delivery for ocular diseases; experience augmented reality and read news
    updates with displays of information literally in your face.

    nerve densities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5872636/) of any
    human tissue, the cornea is 300 to 600 times as sensitive as our skin. Researchers
    have developed small, flexible chips, but power sources have proved more difficult,
    as big batteries and wires clearly won’t do here. Existing applications offer
    less-than-ideal solutions like overnight induction charging and other designs
    that rely on some type of external battery.'

    the researchers describe how they built the device, combining a flexible silicon
    solar cell with a new device that converts tears to energy. The system can reliably
    supply enough electricity to operate smart contacts and other ocular devices.

    the lens and another in a device that can be only about a centimeter away—a very,
    very tiny gap,” says [Pourshaban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erfan-pourshaban-ph-d-09401a12b/),
    who is now a process-integration engineer at Texas Instruments. “It has to be
    right in your line of vision, which isn’t practical. We felt, if you can’t really
    wear it around, then it doesn’t matter if a smart contact’s actual technology
    is great. We’ve got to build a unit that can stand on its own.”

    open, the harvester is off. Then when the eye starts to blink, the tear electrolytes
    meet the magnesium anode, causing an oxidation reaction and the generation of
    electrons. Finally the tear electrolytes come into contact with both an anode
    and the platinum cathode, creating more energy through further oxidation on the
    surface of the anode and oxygen reduction on the surface of the cathode. The electrodes
    are kept from fouling by the motion of the eyelid and continual refreshing of
