    number of businesses that the US government can force to eavesdrop on Americans

- en: Some of the nation’s top legal experts on [a controversial US spy program](https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-safe-act-compromise/)
    argue that the legislation, known as the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America
    Act (RISAA), would enhance the US government’s spy powers, forcing a variety of
    new businesses to secretly eavesdrop on Americans’ overseas calls, texts, and
    email messages.

- en: The Section 702 program, authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
    Act, or FISA, was established more than a decade ago to legalize the government’s
    practice of forcing major telecommunications companies to eavesdrop on overseas
    calls in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

    target foreign citizens who are physically located abroad; on the other, the government
    has fiercely defended its ability to access wiretaps of Americans' emails and
    phone conversations, often years after the fact and in cases unrelated to the
    reasons the wiretaps were ordered in the first place.

- en: The 702 program works by compelling the cooperation of US businesses defined
    by the government as “electronic communications service providers”—traditionally
    phone and email providers such as AT&T and Google. Members of the House Intelligence
    Committee, whose leaders today largely serve as lobbyists for the US intelligence
    community in Congress, have been working to expand the definition of that term,
    enabling the government to force new categories of businesses to eavesdrop on
    the government’s behalf.

    of Review, [wrote last week](https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/)
    that the RISAA legislation expands the definition of “electronic communications
    service provider” (ECSR) to [include data centers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/fisa-surveillance-bill-program.html)
    and commercial landlords—businesses, he says, that “merely have access to communications
    equipment in their physical space.” According to Zwillinger, RISAA may also ensnare
    anyone “with access to such facilities and equipment, including delivery personnel,
    cleaning contractors, and utilities providers.”

- en: 'Zwillinger noted in response that the need for those exclusions is proof enough
    that the text is overly broad; an exception that merely serves to prove that the
    rule exists: “The breadth of the new definition is obvious from the fact that
    the drafters felt compelled to exclude such ordinary places such as senior centers,
    hotels, and coffee shops,” he wrote. “But for these specific exceptions, the scope
    of the new definition would cover them—and scores of businesses that did not receive
    a specific exemption remain within its purview.”'

  zh: Zwillinger在回应中指出，这些排除的需要足以证明该文本过于宽泛；这些例外仅仅证明了规则的存在：“从起草者感到有必要排除的普通场所，如老年中心、酒店和咖啡店，可以明显看出新定义的广度。”他写道。“但是对于这些具体的例外情况，新定义的范围将覆盖它们——以及许多未获得特定豁免的企业。”
