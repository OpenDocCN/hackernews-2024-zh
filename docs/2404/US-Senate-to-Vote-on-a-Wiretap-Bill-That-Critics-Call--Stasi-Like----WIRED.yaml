    this week that, for the next two years at least, could dramatically expand the
    number of businesses that the US government can force to eavesdrop on Americans
    without a warrant.

- en: Some of the nation’s top legal experts on [a controversial US spy program](https://www.wired.com/story/section-702-safe-act-compromise/)
    argue that the legislation, known as the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America
    Act (RISAA), would enhance the US government’s spy powers, forcing a variety of
    new businesses to secretly eavesdrop on Americans’ overseas calls, texts, and
    email messages.

    Act, or FISA, was established more than a decade ago to legalize the government’s
    practice of forcing major telecommunications companies to eavesdrop on overseas
    calls in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

    target foreign citizens who are physically located abroad; on the other, the government
    has fiercely defended its ability to access wiretaps of Americans' emails and
    phone conversations, often years after the fact and in cases unrelated to the
    reasons the wiretaps were ordered in the first place.

    by the government as “electronic communications service providers”—traditionally
    phone and email providers such as AT&T and Google. Members of the House Intelligence
    Committee, whose leaders today largely serve as lobbyists for the US intelligence
    community in Congress, have been working to expand the definition of that term,
    enabling the government to force new categories of businesses to eavesdrop on
    the government’s behalf.

    of Review, [wrote last week](https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/)
    that the RISAA legislation expands the definition of “electronic communications
    service provider” (ECSR) to [include data centers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/us/fisa-surveillance-bill-program.html)
    and commercial landlords—businesses, he says, that “merely have access to communications
    equipment in their physical space.” According to Zwillinger, RISAA may also ensnare
    anyone “with access to such facilities and equipment, including delivery personnel,
    cleaning contractors, and utilities providers.”

    lawmakers to amend the text to explicitly exclude certain types of businesses,
    including hotels.

- en: 'Zwillinger noted in response that the need for those exclusions is proof enough
    that the text is overly broad; an exception that merely serves to prove that the
    rule exists: “The breadth of the new definition is obvious from the fact that
    the drafters felt compelled to exclude such ordinary places such as senior centers,
    hotels, and coffee shops,” he wrote. “But for these specific exceptions, the scope
    of the new definition would cover them—and scores of businesses that did not receive
    a specific exemption remain within its purview.”'

    staffers and privacy experts quietly dubbing the ECSR language the “Stasi amendment,”
    a reference to the East German secret police force notorious for infiltrating
    industry and forcing German citizens to spy on one another.
