- en: American workers by and large believe they'll retire at 65, the nation's traditional
    retirement age. But real life often gets in the way of those plans, with new research
    finding that the majority actually step back from work far earlier. And for many,
    it's not by choice.

- en: The median retirement age for Americans is actually 62, meaning that the typical
    worker is stepping back from their career three years earlier than expected, according
    to [new research](https://www.ebri.org/retirement/retirement-confidence-survey)
    from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit focused on employee
    benefit programs.

    popular idea, often promoted by lawmakers and [business leaders](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-social-security-crisis-raise-retirement-age-blackrock-larry-fink/),
    is that Americans should work longer so they can better afford their golden years.
    Because millions of workers are woefully [lacking in retirement savings](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-savings-how-much-americans-need-1-46-million/),
    working longer is seen as a way to solve their funding gap. In reality, however,
    many U.S. seniors are forced into retirement before they're ready.

    solve the problems we have in retirement," Craig Copeland, director of wealth
    benefits research at EBRI, told CBS MoneyWatch. "That clearly won''t solve all
    the problems because many people just can''t do it."'

    Overall, about half said they stopped working before they had expected, with the
    majority blaming reasons out of their control. For instance, about one-third cited
    a health issue or disability for their earlier-than-expected retirement.

    troubling outcomes. For instance, workers who plan to retire at 65, but are forced
    to stop working years earlier, might not have enough saved.

    found that only about half of workers have calculated how much money they'll need
    in retirement. Of those who examined their financial retirement goals, about one-third
    believe they'll require at least $1.5 million, EBRI found.

    to retire comfortably.  But in reality, most Americans have far less, with EBRI
    noting that about one-third of workers currently have less than $50,000 in savings
    and investments.

    sure they are realistic in what they need to save to reach that number, and that''s

    in retirement, EBRI found, even as the benefits program is set to face a [funding
    shortfall ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-medicare-trust-funds-financial-challenges-shortfall/)in
    less than a decade. If Social Security isn't shored up by 2033, retirees could
    face an across-the-board benefits cut of more than 20%, a worrying issue for workers
    without much saved for retirement.
