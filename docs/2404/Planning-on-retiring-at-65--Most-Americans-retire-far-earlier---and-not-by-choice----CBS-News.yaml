- en: American workers by and large believe they'll retire at 65, the nation's traditional
    retirement age. But real life often gets in the way of those plans, with new research
    finding that the majority actually step back from work far earlier. And for many,
    it's not by choice.

    worker is stepping back from their career three years earlier than expected, according

  zh: 根据员工福利研究所（EBRI）的[新研究](https://www.ebri.org/retirement/retirement-confidence-survey)，美国人的中位退休年龄实际上是62岁，这意味着典型的工人比预期提前三年退出了他们的职业生涯。
- en: The findings underscore the gap between retirement goals and reality. One increasingly
    popular idea, often promoted by lawmakers and [business leaders](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-social-security-crisis-raise-retirement-age-blackrock-larry-fink/),
    is that Americans should work longer so they can better afford their golden years.
    Because millions of workers are woefully [lacking in retirement savings](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-savings-how-much-americans-need-1-46-million/),
    working longer is seen as a way to solve their funding gap. In reality, however,
    many U.S. seniors are forced into retirement before they're ready.
