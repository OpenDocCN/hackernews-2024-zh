    too many examples of false beliefs that aren’t tempting to them, and they start

    a stronger pathogen like smallpox. The inoculation effect in psychology is when
    a person, upon being presented with several weak arguments against a proposition,
    becomes immune to stronger arguments against the same position.

    argument against their faith. “Oh, atheists. Those are those people who think
    stupid things like Jesus = Mithras. I already figured out they’re not worth taking

    That makes this capacity for real doubt – doubting something even though all your
    family and friends is telling you it’s obviously true and you must be an idiot
    to question it at all – a tremendously important skill. It’s especially important
