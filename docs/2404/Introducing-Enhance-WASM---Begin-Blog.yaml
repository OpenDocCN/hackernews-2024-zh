  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web Components are the browser native way to extend HTML. But as a primarily
    browser based technology they are defined with JavaScript which limits them to
    either rendering solely client side — which has janky performance, poor SEO, and
    is not optimally accessible — or within a server-side JavaScript runtime, which
    isn’t always an option for shops that use other backend runtimes.

    rendering is a key requirement for personalized web applications. Organizations
    that prioritize the stability, performance and accessibility of web standards
    run workloads in a huge variety of backend runtimes. **Now we can build browser
    native web interfaces that cross the runtime chasm.**

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Components are authored exactly per the Web Components specification. Enhance
    WASM also enables a more backend oriented pure functional style and has several
    helper libraries for making common client-side patterns cleaner.

- en: '*Do I need to run client JS to render components?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No. Web Components are completely rendered server-side HTML. You can then optionally
    run client-side upgrades should the element need it. It is worth noting we’ve
    found the majority of elements only need to be server rendered and do not require
    any client javascript at all.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We definitely hear community folk when they say, “just use Lit”, but per the
    Lit documentation their own SSR renderer isn’t production ready today, and even
    then is Node.js only. Lit is ultimately more focused on client-side upgrade than
    server-side usage which is totally cool! Enhance encourages SSR and “HTML first”
    and treats the client-side element upgrade as a progressive enhancement step.
    You can use Enhance to render initial HTML and Lit for client-side interactions
    if that makes sense for your project. We find most elements are not client-side
    interactive anyhow.
