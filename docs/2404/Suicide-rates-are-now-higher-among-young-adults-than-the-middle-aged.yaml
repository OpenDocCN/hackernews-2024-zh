- en: Today, we are reposting an important new essay from Jean Twenge’s Substack,
    *[Generation Tech](https://jeanmtwenge.substack.com/),* which she wrote in response
    to a claim made by some researchers who are skeptical of our efforts to call attention
    to the adolescent mental health crisis and link it to the arrival of the phone-based
    childhood. These skeptics [say](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2023/08/22/social_media_the_moral_panic_149648.html)  [that](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/teenage-suicide-social-media-statistics-20190327.html)
    we are focusing too much on some demographic groups, such as teens, and especially
    younger teen girls, who have comparatively low suicide rates, while we say little
    about other groups, such as middle-aged men, who historically have had the highest
    rates of suicide.

    in pre-teen girls, compared to other groups, but we don’t see that fact as any
    critique of our work because what first caught Jean Twenge’s attention in her
    book [iGen](https://www.jeantwenge.com/igen-book-by-dr-jean-twenge/), was the
    sudden *change* in *so many indicators* of mental health for teens, which began
    right around 2012 or 2013\. As Zach and I joined with Jean to extend this research,
    we have [repeatedly found](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/anglo-teen-suicide)  [that
    the group](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-girls-are-not-alright-responses) with
    the largest relative *change* (or percentage change) is the younger teen girls,
    which we take to be an important clue in addressing the scientific mystery: what
    *changed* in the early 2010s, in the lives of teens?'

    boys and men than for girls and women, which makes suicide prevention among boys
    and men extremely urgent (see Richard Reeves’ [important work](https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/)
    on this at the [American Institute for Boys and Men](https://aibm.org/)). Also,
    all along, we have taken it for granted that the highest rates of suicide are
    found in middle-aged men because that has been true for so long. But as Jean shows
    in this new essay: *That is no longer true*. The rise in suicide among Gen Z in
    the U.S. is so big that it is now *Gen Z males*, ages 20-24, who have the highest
    rates of suicide. This is an important new discovery, and is additional evidence
    against claims that the youth mental health crisis is exaggerated and that we’re
    focusing on the wrong groups.'

    rates are highest among the middle-aged. “Suicide rates highest among middle-aged
    men,” read the headline of a [2017 NBC News article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/it-s-not-just-chris-cornell-suicide-rates-highest-among-n762221).
    The [website](https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/middle-aged-men-suicide/)
    for the advocacy group Samaritans says, “Middle-aged men are more likely to die
    by suicide than any other age group.” In reference to the increasing suicide rate
    for young people, psychologists Chris Ferguson and Patrick Markey [countered that](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/teenage-suicide-social-media-statistics-20190327.html)
    “Suicides are higher among middle-aged adults.”

    rise among younger adults. The end result was the reversal of the long-accepted

    Suicide rates for middle-aged men fell precipitously after 2018 while those for
    younger men rose. Until men reach 75 or older, when suicides rise due to terminal
    illness, the highest suicide rates are now among men in their 20s – not the middle-aged.

    decline among Americans in their 50s in 2020-2021? The most obvious explanation
    is the changes wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, although a decline in suicide
    is exactly opposite to the significant rise in suicide many [predicted](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2764584).
    Perhaps there was a silver lining to the pandemic for those in their 50s, especially
    those who worked from home and spent more time with their families. The pandemic
    may have also created a greater appreciation for life, especially among the middle-aged.
    Only time will tell if the lower suicide rate among those in their 50s was a blip
    due to the pandemic or a longer-standing trend with other causes as well.'

    and young adults is not a moral panic. It is now a mandate.'
