Hi! We’re looking for a founding engineer to join us at Greptile.

**About Greptile:**

Greptile is building an AI expert on any codebase, available as an API so teams can easily build powerful internal AI dev tools.

Devs can point Greptile to any GitHub/Gitlab repo, Greptile indexes it (self-updates on new commits) and lets you query it in natural language. Greptile uses a codebase-optimized version of RAG which mimics how human developers navigate codebases, resulting in much higher performance than naive RAG.

You can try our chat UI for free with 150+ OSS repos [here](https://learnthisrepo.com).

Some examples of internal tools teams can/have built:

1.  **Ticket Enricher:** adds codebase context to the the repo including specific file paths to look at.
2.  **Auto doc updater:** writes a PR to update docs every time new code is pushed.
3.  **PR review bot:** reviews PRs and leaves comments with full codebase context.

[See more.](https://docs.greptile.com/examples)

We’re a team of 3 technical co-founders, based in San Francisco.

 **Requirements:**

*   Strong programming skills, especially in TS/JS.
*   BS/MS degree in Computer Science
*   Work authorization in the US
*   Ability and willingness to relocating to work in-person in San Francisco.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

*   History of contributing to open source.
*   Passionate about developer tooling.
*   Ability to work relatively independently.
*   Strong side projects, ideally using LLMs.
*   Some DevOps experience, ideally with AWS.
*   Some LLM-Ops experience, working with VectorDBs/LLMs.

**Tech stack:**

Most of our codebase is in Typescript. Our backend infra is hosted on AWS, combination of ECS containers and Lambda functions + Postgres and DynamoDB for database. The frontend is NextJS.
