    can have a long and happy career without caring about the differences between
    properties and attributes. But, if you need to dig down into the DOM at a lower
    level, it helps to know. Even if you feel you know the difference, maybe I'll
    touch on a couple of details you hadn't considered. So let's dig in…

    the prop as a property if `propName in element`, otherwise they'll set an attribute.
    Basically, they prefer properties over attributes. Their render-to-string methods
    do the opposite, and ignore things that are property-only.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: This explains why custom elements don't seem to work in React. Since they're
    custom, their properties aren't in React's 'predefined list', so they're set as
    attributes instead. Anything that's property-only on the custom element simply
    won't work. This will be fixed in React 19, where they'll switch to the Preact/VueJS
    model for custom elements.

    what *looks like* an attribute. But, even though you're using the property name
    rather than the attribute name, [React will set the `class` attribute under the
    hood](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/699d03ce1a175442fe3443e1d1bed14f14e9c197/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L388-L389).
