# The Eclipse via Satellite - kieranhealy.org

Yesterday’s eclipse as seen by the [GOES-East](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/) weather satellite. I just grabbed the full-disk geocolor JPGs with `wget` and stitched them together with `ffmpeg`.

BTW, If you’re wondering why the clouds remain in view as night falls to the East, it’s because the geocolor image is a composite of “true color” daytime and a Multispectral Infra-Red image for the night part. GEOS-East and West capture I think sixteen basic wavelength bands that can then be composited into various combination images. You can see them all, plus various composites, at [the GOES Image viewer](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/fulldisk.php?sat=G16)
