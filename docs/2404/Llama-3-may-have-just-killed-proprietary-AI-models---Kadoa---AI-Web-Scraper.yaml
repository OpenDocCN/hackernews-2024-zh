    point when open source models finally closed the gap with proprietary models.
    The initial benchmarks show that Llama-3 70B comes pretty close to GPT-4 in many
    tasks:'

    earth"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth) approach by releasing powerful
    open models to disrupt the competitive landscape and avoid being left behind in
    the AI race.

    up with Meta. Google is also making moves into the open model space and has similar
    capabilities to Meta. It will be interesting to see where they fit in.
