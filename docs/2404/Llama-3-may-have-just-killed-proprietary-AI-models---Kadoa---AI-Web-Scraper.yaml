    point when open source models finally closed the gap with proprietary models.
    The initial benchmarks show that Llama-3 70B comes pretty close to GPT-4 in many
    tasks:'

    to surpass GPT-4 and Opus once released.

- en: Some speculate that Meta's goal from the start was to target OpenAI with a ["scorched
    earth"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth) approach by releasing powerful
    open models to disrupt the competitive landscape and avoid being left behind in
    the AI race.

    a revenue of $134B and profits of $39B in 2023.

    up with Meta. Google is also making moves into the open model space and has similar
    capabilities to Meta. It will be interesting to see where they fit in.

    AI deeply into their products in a very cost-effective and performant way. There
    are already over 800 [llama-3 models variations on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=modified&search=llama3),
    and it looks like everyone will be able to fine-tune for their us-cases, languages,

    of AI, but it's probably too early to declare the death of proprietary models.
    Who knows, maybe GPT-5 will surprise us all and surpass our imaginations of what
    transformer models can do.
