    capable of running your company. In fact you can be sure that we have all the
    faith in you that you‚Äôll probably start your own unicorn at some point. But startups
    are (famously) hard, and it‚Äôs usually good practice to see how a good one is run
    before you start your own. This is truer than ever with the current AI boom, where
    you really want to see what sets a great AI company from a mediocre one.
