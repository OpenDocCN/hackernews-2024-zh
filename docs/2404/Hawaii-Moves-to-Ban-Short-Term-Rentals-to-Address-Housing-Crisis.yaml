    shortages of affordable housing in the country](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/hawaii-s-plan-to-build-more-housing-could-be-national-model?embedded-checkout=true),
    is currently advancing two bills that would authorize county governments to phase
    out short-term rentals, like those found on Airbnb and Vrbo. The bills, HB 1838
    and SB 2919, passed with amendments on Tuesday and will go back to their chambers
    of origin for final votes.

    are elected by voters statewide, testified in March that more than half of all
    short-term rentals (STRs) in Hawaii are owned by people living out-of-state, and
    more than a quarter of STR owners own more than 20 units. The median rent in Hawaii
    is more than $2,200 and the median home price is $839,000, [making it the most
    expensive state to live in the U.S.](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/opinion/2024/04/09/zoning-reform-can-cure-hawaiis-housing-struggles?amp=1)

    not followed through; in March, he said a moratorium on vacation rentals wasn’t
    necessary because enough units had been secured for the more than 3,000 survivors
    still living in hotels. Though the state said in March that dozens of survivors
    of the fires are moving into housing, [thousands remain in hotels](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2024/03/27/hawaii-lahaina-fire-housing-hotels/00d895d6-eca1-11ee-8f2c-380a821c02db_story.html),
