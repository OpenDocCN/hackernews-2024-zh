# In the first Autonomous Racing League race, the struggle was real - The Verge

The first race of the [Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League](https://a2rl.io/) (A2RL) took place on the Yas Marina Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 track today, and I’m pleased to report that a race both began and ended. But the event was not without strife — far from it. During qualifying time trials, the driverless Dallara Super Formula racers outfitted with cameras and software seemed to struggle mightily to complete a full lap.

During the trials, cars randomly juked:

Or just pulled off the track to take a little break:

You get well-acquainted with the interstitial music during these highlights. All praise to the patience and grace of the announcers, who didn’t sigh once that I heard. Instead, they declared things like that these cars are “pushing the boundaries of science.”

When it [came time for the actual race](https://youtu.be/HZPj9iAWz-4?t=56944), the lead racer, Polimove, [spun out](https://youtu.be/HZPj9iAWz-4?t=6848) on the fourth of eight laps. The second car, Tum, passed it safely, but shortly after that, the event’s officials threw up a yellow flag. And since these are good AI drivers who obey the rules, the two behind Polimove stopped, unwilling to pass the spun-out yellow car. Racers aren’t supposed to pass each other during a caution lap, you see.

About an hour after the first lap of A2RL began, the AI racers completed their eight-lap race. If you must know, Tum won.

These are early days for autonomous racing, and surely things will get better eventually — certainly, they’ve come a long way since [Roborace’s first full circuit](/2017/5/24/15684910/roborace-lap-paris-video-self-driving-car) in 2017\. I’m looking forward to the day they’re as good as human racers (if that [ever happens](/24065447/self-driving-car-autonomous-tesla-gm-baidu)). But for right now, we’re very much still in the “congratulate baby for successfully getting most of its food into its mouth” phase of self-driving racers.
