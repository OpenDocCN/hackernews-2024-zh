- en: “What you do on your computer should be your business, and no one else’s,” Cantwell,
    the dot-com millionaireand former U.S. House member, said in a 2000 [campaign
    video](https://youtu.be/JK0aE7t2hfg?t=67) that showed her huddled around a clunky
    white desktop monitor with a group of schoolchildren. The internet, she said,
    should remain “a tool for learning,” not for governments and private companies
    to “invade your privacy.”
