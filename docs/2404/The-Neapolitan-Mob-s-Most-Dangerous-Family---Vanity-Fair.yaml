- en: The thing about being murdered, it usually comes as a surprise. Even in Naples,
    where the criminal clans known collectively as the Camorra are again struggling
    violently for control of the streets, no victim wakes up expecting on that given
    day to die. He shaves carefully, dresses in his beloved clothes, slips on an expensive
    watch, and maybe squeezes his wife before heading out to meet with his friends.
    If he suspected his fate, he might at least kiss his wife good-bye. But the neighborhood
    has been home for generations to everyone he knows who counts. He deals there
    in extortion, protection, narcotics, and counterfeit goods. He abides by alternative
    rules. For this he is respected. He rarely carries a gun. His experience until
    now has been that murder happens only to others. Then someone comes along and
    kills him.

  zh: 被谋杀的事情，通常会让人感到意外。即使在那不勒斯，以卡莫拉为代表的犯罪团伙再次激烈争夺控制街道的时候，也没有受害者会在那一天醒来时期待着死亡。他仔细刮胡子，穿着心爱的衣服，戴上昂贵的手表，也许在离开前还会亲吻妻子。如果他预感到自己的命运，他至少会亲吻妻子告别。但在这个邻里，几代人都是他认识和重要的人。他在这里从事勒索、保护费、毒品和假冒商品的生意。他遵循另类规则。因此，他受到尊重。他很少携带枪支。直到现在，他的经历一直是，谋杀只会发生在别人身上。然后，有人突然出现并杀了他。
- en: It is a strangely final event. There may be a moment of recognition at the end,
    but by then the man can no longer stay alive. Recently, in a northern district
    called Secondigliano, it was obvious that the victim knew his fate for about seven
    seconds before he died. Secondigliano is an old farming town that has been swallowed
    by the city. It has evolved into one of Europe’s largest open-air drug markets
    and a working-class stronghold for the Camorra. The victim was a mid-ranking member
    of one of its clans involved in a typically convoluted struggle, and not known
    to the police before. He was in his mid-30s and beginning to bald. He was immaculately
    dressed and groomed. As was his habit, he had come to a small street-front gambling
    shop to play a bit of one-armed bandit. Surveillance cameras there captured his
    demise. It was broad daylight. As a cautionary measure he had placed three guards
    outside, one of whom was burly, but none of whom was armed. The gambling shop
    was narrow and had space for only six machines against one wall. In the back was
    a closed door. The victim was alone in the room. He sat on a stool to gamble.

  zh: 这是一个异常的终结事件。在最后可能会有一瞬间的认知，但此时此刻，这个人再也无法继续活着了。最近，在一个名为Secondigliano的北部地区，显然，受害者在死亡前大约七秒钟就意识到了自己的命运。Secondigliano曾是一个被城市吞噬的古老农场小镇，如今已发展成为欧洲最大的露天毒品市场之一，也是卡莫拉（Camorra）的工人阶级据点。受害者是其一个团伙的中层成员，卷入了一场典型的错综复杂的斗争，此前警方并不认识他。他三十多岁，开始有秃顶迹象。他穿着整洁，仪表整齐。按照他的习惯，他来到一家小型街边赌博店打一把老虎机。店里的监控摄像头记录了他的死亡。当时正是白天。作为预防措施，他在外面安排了三名保镖，其中一名身材魁梧，但没有人携带武器。赌博店很窄，只能靠墙摆放六台老虎机。后面是一扇关闭的门。受害者独自一人在房间里，坐在凳子上玩赌博游戏。
- en: A street camera caught the killers’ arrival. There were two of them. They pulled
    up fast on a motor scooter, both in full-face helmets with the visors down. From
    the certainty of their movements, they seemed sure that the victim was inside.
    It is not known who had informed them. The clerk who normally tended to the shop
    was nowhere in sight. As soon as the scooter came to a stop, the man on the back
    hopped off and, with a 9-mm. pistol in hand, strode purposefully toward the front
    door. The guards fled before him. Two of them, including the burly one, tumbled
    into the room to raise the alarm. The camera inside showed them bursting in, followed
    closely by the gunman—a slender figure looking bug-like in his full-face armor.
    The victim reacted immediately. He leapt from his stool, dashed to the back door,
    and tugged on it, only to find that it was locked. His heart must have been racing.
    He turned and tried to escape through the front. This took him to within point-blank
    range of the gunman, who had stopped about halfway into the room. With two pistol
    kicks, the gunman shot him in the back as he passed. The victim fell facedown.
    The gunman took two steps forward, leaned over, and finished him with a single
    shot to the head.

  zh: 街头摄像头捕捉到了凶手的到来。他们是两个人。他们快速驶入一辆摩托车，两人戴着全罩头盔，面罩关闭。从他们的动作确定性来看，他们似乎确信受害者在里面。不知道是谁通知了他们。通常负责店铺的职员不见了踪影。摩托车一停下来，后面的人跳下来，手持9毫米手枪，笃定地朝前门走去。两名保安在他面前逃离。其中两名，包括那个魁梧的，跌进房间里发出警报。摄像头显示他们破门而入，持枪者紧随其后——一个细瘦的身影，穿着全罩装甲看起来像一个昆虫。受害者立即做出反应。他从凳子上跳起来，冲向后门，试图拉开，却发现被锁上了。他的心一定在飞速跳动。他转身试图从前门逃走。这使他距离持枪者只有一步之遥，后者已经停在房间中间。持枪者用两枪踢他的背部。受害者面朝下倒下。持枪者向前迈了两步，俯身过去，用一枪结束了他的性命。
- en: 'But the gunman was not cool about the killing. In his rush to get away, he
    tripped over a stool and crashed to the floor, catching himself with his forearms
    and rolling as he rose. The gyration left him facing back toward the room just
    as the burly guard, in his own hurry to escape, made the mistake of barging in
    his direction. The gunman fired twice into the guard’s chest. The guard fell backward
    and lay stretched for a while, repetitively moving his hands to his chest until
    he lowered his hands and died. By then the gunman had already climbed onto the
    motor scooter behind his accomplice outside, and the two had raced away. The scooter
    did not have legible license plates. Shortly afterward a detective told me that
    the police had not been able to identify the assailants, but he assured me that
    the Camorra already had. So take the long view, he said: one way or another, justice
    will probably be done. Furthermore, even the state will eventually figure things
    out if only because in Naples, he said, murder is a language that the police can
    understand. The dead may talk, he implied, more fully than the living can.'

- en: The Camorra is not an organization like the Mafia that can be separated from
    society, disciplined in court, or even quite defined. It is an amorphous grouping
    in Naples and its hinterlands of more than 100 autonomous clans and perhaps 10,000
    immediate associates, along with a much larger population of dependents, clients,
    and friends. It is an understanding, a way of justice, a means of creating wealth
    and spreading it around. It has been a part of life in Naples for centuries—far
    longer than the fragile construct called Italy has even existed. At its strongest
    it has grown in recent years into a complete parallel world and, in many people’s
    minds, an alternative to the Italian government, whatever that term may mean.
    Neapolitans call it “the system” with resignation and pride. The Camorra offers
    them work, lends them money, protects them from the government, and even suppresses
    street crime. The problem is that periodically the Camorra also tries to tear
    itself apart, and when that happens, ordinary Neapolitans need to duck.

- en: Secondigliano is well practiced at this. It currently has one of the highest
    murder rates in Western Europe. Probably one of the highest shooting rates, too.
    I have a friend from there who is an architect. Her father is a retired municipal-bus
    driver. He owns a station wagon that he uses to transport another daughter, who
    requires a wheelchair. One day not long ago two men stole the station wagon, then
    called the family’s apartment and demanded 2,000 euros in cash for the return
    of the car. The thieves were cheap Camorra punks, the lowest sort of clan associates.
    My friend was outraged, but her father paid what he could of the ransom. He did
    this on a street, with the cash in an envelope, while his daughter circled around
    trying to take pictures with her cell phone. None of the pictures worked out.
    My friend accused her father of complicity with the system. He answered that he
    simply could not afford to buy another car. Yes, there was a time when no punk
    from Secondigliano would have dared to steal the car of a local man with a crippled
    child—because the Camorra itself would have intervened. But he did not feel sorry
    for himself. He is a realist. Fighting broke out in the district in 2004, and
    it has continued sporadically ever since, weakening the clans to the point where
    they can no longer control their own. The lowest of them are idiots who know only
    how to shoot. And so what? You learn to duck. In his entire life only once has
    he had to buy back his car. Certainly the government of Italy has cost him more
    in taxes.

    not isolate himself from Naples as a northerner might have. He opened his heart

    Camorra—skirting the narrow streets of the old city center, where the police don’t
    go, grinding uphill past the airport, with all of its associated rackets, stopping
    by a popular drug market in an alley of Secondigliano, and ending in a slum called
    Scampia, a district of dispersed apartment blocks where the Camorra holds sway

- en: Scampia is what poverty looks like when Corbusierian city planners try to impose
    their utopias on people’s lives. The sidewalks are broad but empty. The parks
    are fenced off for safety. There are almost no stores or cafés. Many of the residences
    are falling prematurely into ruin, and some, still inhabited, have been gutted
    by fire. A Catholic billboard reads, if you believe in scampia, you will find
    a sea of love. In the common space of one iconic building, a broken pipe has been
    gushing municipal water into the gutters for five years straight. Nearby there
    are several gloomy apartment blocks that enclose defensible courtyards and have
    fortified stairwells that can be controlled from within. These are the drug bazaars—known
    as piazzas—over which Neapolitans have spilled so much blood. They are among the
    more lucrative retail operations in the world—outlets for low-grade heroin and
    cocaine that function openly but remain largely beyond the reach of the state.
    The logistical details vary, depending on location and customer base, but the
    largest operations run day and night, and deploy dozens of lookouts to cover the
    approaches—some sitting astride motor scooters on the streets, some watching the
    driveways and parking areas from upper-floor windows, others standing in groups
    at the allowed entry points to the courtyards and buildings. Again, there are
    variations, but the ideal is to seal off the outer perimeter of the complex by
    augmenting the existing window bars and steel doors with concertina wire and heavy
    bolts, and then to cut a small portal in the ground-floor wall of a stairwell—whether
    to the courtyard or to the back of the complex—through which cash and narcotics
    can be safely exchanged.

    closed. In any case, they themselves are often involved, whether as lookouts,
    needle vendors, or the recipients of the Camorra’s aid. More fundamentally, the
    Camorra is simply a part of life. One afternoon I walked with a police detective—armed,
    gritty, unshaven, and in sweatshirt and jeans—past a group of Camorra soldiers,
    across a courtyard, and through an open steel door into a stairwell. A couple
    of chairs stood by a portal cut into a wall. The door was equipped with a massive
    locking bolt which the detective demonstrated by sliding it into place. Soon afterward
    a woman appeared from upstairs, accompanied by a young girl. Without a word they
    walked past us to the door, which the mother unbolted to go outside. The girl
    said, “But, Mama, don’t we have to wait for the men to give us permission?” The

    and Secondigliano has been going on for so long that some prosecutors almost regret
    their previous triumphs. In memory there is a golden era when the Camorra was
    strong. The boss then was a recluse named Paolo Di Lauro, a presence rarely seen,
    who is now in prison effectively for life and stands as one of the greatest Camorristi
    of all time. Little is known of his early years except that he was born in Secondigliano
    in 1953, was orphaned young, and was adopted by a family of modest means that
    had a house near the center of the district. The mother was a housewife, the father
    a simple laborer. They were deep Neapolitans who spoke a dialect nearly unintelligible
    elsewhere in Italy. Di Lauro attended a few years of primary school before dropping
    out and getting to work, first as an assistant for a local shopkeeper. By his
    late teens he had moved to the industrial zones of far-off Northern Italy, where
    he worked door-to-door selling underwear and bedsheets to migrant factory workers
    from the South. In local parlance such merchants are known as *magliari,* a word
    that can also mean cheaters. There is no evidence that Di Lauro cheated anyone

  zh: Betrayal? The Camorra murders especially when it is weak. The killing in Scampia
    and Secondigliano has been going on for so long that some prosecutors almost regret
    their previous triumphs. In memory there is a golden era when the Camorra was
    strong. The boss then was a recluse named Paolo Di Lauro, a presence rarely seen,
    who is now in prison effectively for life and stands as one of the greatest Camorristi
    of all time. Little is known of his early years except that he was born in Secondigliano
    in 1953, was orphaned young, and was adopted by a family of modest means that
    had a house near the center of the district. The mother was a housewife, the father
    a simple laborer. They were deep Neapolitans who spoke a dialect nearly unintelligible
    elsewhere in Italy. Di Lauro attended a few years of primary school before dropping
    out and getting to work, first as an assistant for a local shopkeeper. By his
    late teens he had moved to the industrial zones of far-off Northern Italy, where
    he worked door-to-door selling underwear and bedsheets to migrant factory workers
    from the South. In local parlance such merchants are known as *magliari,* a word
    that can also mean cheaters. There is no evidence that Di Lauro cheated anyone
    at the time, but his subsequent history indicates that he might not have hesitated
    if given the chance. He was quiet and unusually ambitious. In the North he made
    a bit of money and developed a taste for card games and gambling. It turned out
    that he was mathematically inclined. Back in Secondigliano he married a local
    girl who in 1973 bore him the first of 11 children—all of them sons. His wife
    was very Catholic, as was he. They loved each other very much.
- en: He was not a fighter. It was his coolness when gambling that brought him to
    the attention of the clan that controlled Secondigliano at the time. The head
    of the clan was a flamboyant Camorrista named Aniello La Monica, who had a clothing
    store named Python, after his preferred weapon, a heavy .357 Magnum revolver.
    La Monica was an aggressive killer—responsible for the deaths of many men, including,
    it is said, one by hands-on decapitation—but he was strangely shy about the drug
    trade, preferring to stick to the traditional pursuits of dealing in black-market
    cigarettes, meddling in public construction, and protecting the neighborhood shopkeepers
    from crime. Around 1975 he engaged Di Lauro to do the clan’s books. The position
    gave Di Lauro a privileged view of the business and convinced him after several
    years—despite the continuing reluctance of La Monica—that far greater profits
    could be made in the as yet unexploited local trade in heroin and cocaine. This
    became all the more evident after the great Neapolitan earthquake of 1980, which
    drove thousands of people from their ruined center-city slums and swelled the
    Scampia public-housing projects with the poor and dispossessed.

  zh: 他并不是一个搏斗者。正是他在赌博时的冷静引起了当时控制Secondigliano的家族的注意。家族的头目是一个名叫阿尼洛·拉莫尼卡的花花公子，他的服装店以他钟爱的武器命名——一支重达.357口径马格南左轮手枪，名叫Python。拉莫尼卡是一个侵略性的杀手——据说负责了许多人的死亡，包括亲手斩首的——但他对毒品交易却异常羞涩，更倾向于坚持传统的非法香烟交易，干预公共建设，并保护邻里店主免受犯罪侵害。约在1975年，他聘请迪劳罗来做家族的账务。这个位置让迪劳罗有了对生意的特权视角，并在几年后说服了他——尽管拉莫尼卡依然不情愿——在尚未开发的本地海洛因和可卡因贸易中能够获得更大的利润。这一点在1980年那不勒斯大地震后变得更加明显，地震迫使成千上万的人们离开他们的市中心贫民窟，使斯坎皮亚的公共住房项目充斥着贫困和无家可归的人群。
- en: In the years that followed, billions of dollars of reconstruction funds infused
    cash into every level of Neapolitan society. Di Lauro stuck to the shadows. He
    spoke little. He listened and observed. He believed that rational people can resolve
    their professional disputes through compromise and negotiation, and that they
    should kill only as a last resort. He was more self-disciplined, however, than
    he was gentle. La Monica, who is said to have been a good judge of men, came to
    fear that Di Lauro was the most ruthless man of all. For his part, Di Lauro concluded
    that La Monica had become an impediment to business, and in 1982 he tried to remove
    him from power by informing key clan members, as the bookkeeper, that La Monica
    had been taking more than his fair share of the proceeds. When La Monica learned
    of Di Lauro’s treachery, he hired two killers from a nearby town to hunt Di Lauro
    down. They arrived by motor scooter, found Di Lauro at a street market, shot at
    him, missed, and chased him around until he escaped.

- en: Afterward there was no room left for compromise, and people within the clan
    faced the prospect of having to choose between the two men. Any uncertainty they
    felt did not last for long. Di Lauro paid an associate to lure La Monica out of
    his house by offering to show him stolen diamonds, and La Monica, much as he recognized
    the risk, walked into the trap so he would not seem to be cowering at home. Once
    on the street he found that the associate had disappeared. Before he could retreat
    into his house, Di Lauro and three others came speeding around a corner in a Fiat
    and smashed into him. The impact did not knock him down. The damage to the Fiat
    is unknown. Di Lauro and his accomplices got out of the car and killed La Monica
    with pistol shots. La Monica was barely 40 years old. Di Lauro was not yet 30\.
    It is rumored that he was a poor marksman. On the advice of his friends, he swore
    never again to handle a gun. It seems that he never did, directly, from then on.

  zh: 后来，妥协的余地已经没有了，家族内部的人面临着必须在这两个人之间选择的前景。他们感到的任何不确定感都没有持续多久。迪劳罗支付一个同伙去引诱拉莫尼卡离开他的房子，以展示偷来的钻石，尽管他意识到风险，但拉莫尼卡还是走进了陷阱，以免显得在家里畏缩不前。一旦走上街头，他发现那个同伙已经消失了。在他能撤退回家之前，迪劳罗和其他三人驾驶着一辆菲亚特车急速转过街角，撞向了他。撞击并没有把他击倒。菲亚特车的损坏程度未知。迪劳罗和他的同伙们下车用手枪将拉莫尼卡射杀。拉莫尼卡年仅40岁。迪劳罗还不到30岁。据传言，他是个射击技术差的人。在朋友的建议下，他发誓再也不碰枪。似乎从那时起，他就再也没有直接动过枪。
- en: 'On the day of La Monica’s funeral, all of Secondigliano mourned, and many shopkeepers
    closed their doors in respect. Di Lauro solemnly attended the burial, then faded
    again into the shadows. He was so averse to standing out that the police knew
    nothing about him for years. They had no idea who had murdered La Monica, because
    no one talked. Soon after the killing, the leaders of an important clan in the
    center of the city asked for a meeting, because they too could not decipher the
    event. Di Lauro attended the meeting with several of his men and explained that
    they wanted to do business in friendship and peace. This was true, at least for
    Di Lauro himself. As luck would have it, the police picked that meeting to raid.
    They detained Di Lauro but then released him without questioning, assuming he
    was a minor thug of no consequence. Di Lauro swore that he would never again attend
    such a meeting. He was a great one for drawing lessons from life. He liked to
    teach lessons, too. For instance: It is better to share profits than to fight
    over them. And: You have to be willing to go to war, but if violence is your only
    skill, you will lose in the end and die. And: Murder is bad because it attracts
    attention. And: If the police search your place, stay calm; do not act cocky;
    do not say more than necessary. Live modestly, dress modestly, drive modestly,
    do not carry a gun. Do not use drugs. If you want to gamble and whore around,
    that’s fine, but do it somewhere far away, like Monaco or Marbella. Go with French
    women or Spanish. Here in Secondigliano, don’t fuck casually with other men’s
    wives and daughters. Here in Secondigliano, the only sound we should hear is the

  zh: 拉莫尼卡的葬礼那天，整个Secondigliano都在哀悼，许多店主也关闭了他们的店铺以示尊敬。迪劳罗郑重地出席了葬礼，然后再次淡出人们的视线。他对于不显眼如此厌恶，以至于警方多年来对他一无所知。他们对谁谋杀了拉莫尼卡毫无头绪，因为没有人说话。杀害发生后不久，城市中心一个重要家族的领袖们要求会面，因为他们也搞不明白这个事件。迪劳罗带着几个手下参加了会议，并解释说他们想要在友谊和平的基础上做生意。至少对于迪劳罗本人来说是真的。不巧的是，警方选择在那个会议上突袭。他们拘留了迪劳罗，但随后没有进行询问，认为他只是一个无足轻重的小混混。迪劳罗发誓他再也不会参加这样的会议。他擅长从生活中汲取教训。他也喜欢教训别人。例如：与其为了利润而争斗，还不如分享利润。还有：你必须愿意开战，但如果暴力是你唯一的技能，最终你会失败并且死去。还有：谋杀是不好的，因为它会引起注意。还有：如果警察搜查你的地方，保持冷静；不要表现得自大；不要多说话。过着朴素的生活，穿着朴素的衣服，开朴素的车，不要带枪。不要吸毒。如果你想赌博和嫖妓，没问题，但要去远离这里的地方，比如摩纳哥或马贝拉。跟法国女人或西班牙女人上床。在Secondigliano，不要随便与别人的妻子和女儿乱搞。在Secondigliano，我们应该听到的唯一声音是现金的咔嚓声。

- en: By 1992, a decade after killing La Monica, Di Lauro was on his way to becoming
    one of the wealthiest men in Italy, with an uncountable fortune in the hundreds
    of millions of dollars. I recently spoke to Vittorio Giaquinto, his former lawyer—a
    large, immaculately dressed man sitting in the splendor of a baroque office—who
    is one of the few people who knew Di Lauro well. He said that Di Lauro was motivated
    less by greed than by operational logic, and by an unwavering determination, as
    an orphan himself, to provide for the long-term security of his family. As a gambler,
    Di Lauro knew that he was playing a loser’s game and would have to diversify into
    legitimate businesses if he was to achieve that aim. He founded a holding company
    through which ultimately he went into textiles, home furnishings, meat and dairy
    products, bottled water, cash-and-carry wholesale markets, prepared-food distribution,
    shopping-mall development, residential real estate, hotels, restaurants, shops
    of all sorts in Secondigliano, and a clothing store in Paris in the 12th Arrondissement.
    People say that he accumulated a fortune in precious stones sufficient to pave
    the autostrada all the way to Rome. And yet, despite his understanding of the
    special risks, he was unwilling to quit dealing in drugs. He kept going, though
    knowing it could ruin him and, worse, destroy the lives of his wife and sons.
    In this endeavor he was a gambler unable to stop.

  zh: 到1992年，在杀死 La Monica 十年后，Di Lauro 正在成为意大利最富有的人之一，他的财富难以计数，达到数亿美元。我最近与他的前律师 Vittorio
    Giaquinto 进行了交谈，他是一个身材魁梧、衣着一丝不苟，坐落在巴洛克风格办公室的人，也是为数不多真正了解 Di Lauro 的人之一。他说，Di Lauro
    的动机不是贪婪，而是出于运营逻辑，以及作为一个孤儿，他有坚定的决心为家人的长期安全提供保障。作为一个赌徒，Di Lauro 知道他在进行的是一个注定会输的游戏，如果他要实现这一目标，他必须进入合法业务领域进行多样化。他通过成立控股公司，最终进入了纺织品、家居用品、肉类和乳制品、瓶装水、现金和自助批发市场、预制食品分销、购物中心开发、住宅地产、酒店、餐厅、Secondigliano
    各类商店以及巴黎第十二区的一家服装店等领域。有人说，他积累了足以铺设整条高速公路通往罗马的宝石财富。然而，尽管他了解到特殊风险，他仍不愿放弃毒品交易。他继续前行，尽管知道这可能毁了他，更糟糕的是，摧毁了他妻子和儿子的生活。在这一努力中，他是一个无法停止的赌徒。
- en: 'For Secondigliano, those were the golden years anyway. Di Lauro tried to guard
    himself against betrayal. His greatest defense was the business structure he built,
    arranged as a pyramid of independent entrepreneurs, acting as franchisees under
    his guidance, and respected by him as largely autonomous associates. There were
    about 20 at that level, each with the exclusive rights to a major drug piazza.
    They bought a minimum of narcotics from Di Lauro each week, and paid a significant
    rent, but beyond that they were free to earn as much from their piazzas as they
    could. This included going to outside vendors for additional supplies if they
    could find them at a better price than Di Lauro offered. He would even finance
    them, and at low interest rates, if they required it. In return, Di Lauro expected
    a certain code of behavior: within the clan, people would be treated fairly, down
    to the lowest level of associates; they would not quarrel stupidly with one another;
    they would recognize Di Lauro as an arbiter in cases where the quarrel was real;
    in other ways, also, they would recognize Di Lauro’s authority at all times; they
    would not take independent action against any other group in the city; and, finally,
    they would never—never!—speak Di Lauro’s name.'

  zh: 对Secondigliano来说，那些无论如何都是黄金岁月。Di Lauro试图防范背叛。他最大的防御是建立的商业结构，安排为一个由独立企业家组成的金字塔，在他的指导下作为特许经营者，并受到他尊敬，基本上是自治的合作伙伴。在那一级大约有20人，每个人拥有一个主要的毒品销售点的独家权利。他们每周从Di
    Lauro那里最少购买一定数量的毒品，并支付显著的租金，但除此之外，他们可以自由地从他们的销售点中赚取尽可能多的利润。这包括如果他们能以比Di Lauro提供的更低的价格找到的话，可以向外部供应商采购额外的商品。他甚至愿意为他们提供低利率的贷款，如果他们需要的话。作为回报，Di
    Lauro期望有一定的行为准则：在家族内部，所有人都会公平对待，即使是最低级别的合作伙伴；他们不会愚蠢地互相争吵；在真正有争端的情况下，他们会把Di Lauro视为仲裁者；在其他方面，他们也会始终承认Di
    Lauro的权威；他们不会对城市内的任何其他集团采取独立行动；最后，他们绝对不会——绝对不会！——提及Di Lauro的名字。

    parked outside a bar. He sent a man inside to investigate. It turned out that
    a beautiful girl was being held until she chose one of her captors as a lover.
    Di Lauro sent word for the party to break up, saying he didn’t want this sort
    of foolishness in his district. He was not much for flirtation or fun. It is said
    that he enjoyed practical jokes, but the only hint is contained in a story which
    may not be true: that he once dressed as a butcher in a butcher shop he owned
    and gave the shoppers 50 euros in change for every 5 euros they spent. The customers
    were embarrassed, one version goes, because they saw right through him, as if
    he were a king playing foolishly at pretend. The customers were so impressed to

    Lauro传达消息让聚会解散，说他不希望他的区域里发生这种愚蠢事情。他并不喜欢调情或者娱乐。据说他喜欢恶作剧，但唯一的线索是一个也许不真实的故事：他曾经在自己拥有的肉铺里打扮成屠夫，给购物者每花费5欧元找零50欧元。顾客尴尬了，一种版本说，因为他们看穿了他，就像一个国王在假装中愚弄众人。另一个版本说，顾客见到他本人印象深刻，甚至排队亲吻他的手。

    would have recognized him if he had. Within the community he was known mythically

    phantom, the unseen power who had transformed the northern districts of Naples
    into Europe’s greatest drug emporium, but also employed many thousands of people
    and had effectively banished street crime from Secondigliano and Scampia. By the
    mid-1990s, rape, robbery, assault, and theft had all but disappeared. You could
    walk anywhere you wanted at any hour. If you had a car or motor scooter, you could
    park it anywhere without worry, except perhaps for the radio (because, after all,
    this was Italy). When the important newspaper *Il Mattino* published an article
    about illicit gambling in the districts, Di Lauro ordered that the gambling stop—and
    it did, permanently, within 48 hours. When he decided that the traditional business
    of extorting protection money from local shopkeepers was causing more trouble
    than it was worth, he ordered not only that it be halted but that his men start
    paying full prices, and even thank the shopkeepers for their services. It was
    strange, but they did. For this and all the favors he gave, he was widely loved—and

    overland by truck or car to Naples. Once in Secondigliano, the drugs were diluted

    elsewhere in Italy, and in Germany and France. Meanwhile, Di Lauro was manufacturing
    counterfeit brand-name goods, which he wholesaled in Western Europe, Brazil, and
    the United States. Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Gucci, Prada—that

    that produced the originals, and were identical down to the stitching; others
    were crude knockoffs. It was a profitable business, and not the sort that would

    bar well stocked with French wines and liqueurs, a bunkroom for the boys, and
    a large, sparsely furnished living room where Di Lauro made decisions. The living
    room had religious icons on the walls. Di Lauro hardly dared to go to church.
    He hardly dared to use the phone. He had a back passage for escape. He eyed people
    closely when he spoke to them, and expressed himself in language so spare that

    remained safely out of sight partly by suppressing the Camorra’s tendency toward
    anarchic violence. He did condone some killings, but these were quiet actions
    within the clan, not public vendettas. For the safety of the group, regrettably,
    a few men had to be made to disappear. The kills were so clean that after 10 years,

    response was disastrous: certain members of Di Lauro’s clan went rogue, and on
    their own authority set out not just to hunt down Ruocco but to exterminate his
    entire family. Ruocco survived by fleeing to Milan, but Di Lauro’s men killed
    his aging mother, killed his uncle, shot his brother (he survived), shot his brother’s
    wife (she died), and tried to kill a sister by locking her in a bathroom and setting
    it on fire (she escaped through a window and left town). Di Lauro was angry about
    these actions. The targeting of innocent family members—and particularly an old
    woman—constituted a serious violation of Camorra norms. Worse, the drama had called
    attention to the northern districts. Di Lauro regained control by having the woman’s
    killers killed in turn, and by ordering a cease-fire, but dangerous questions
    had been raised that would not go away.'

  zh: 然而，同一年，迪劳罗短暂失去了控制权。一位名叫安东尼奥·罗科的前同事——一个在附近小镇领导小集团的人——从监狱释放回来后发现他的地盘被分配给了另一个人。罗科发动战争，经过几次来回的杀戮后，聚集了几名持枪者，在斯坎皮亚的一家酒吧开枪射击，使用突击步枪击毙了迪劳罗的五名亲信，另有九人受伤。如果这已经很糟糕，那么回应就更糟了：迪劳罗家族的某些成员变得叛逆，凭借自己的权威不仅追捕罗科，还打算灭绝他的整个家族。罗科逃到米兰幸存下来，但迪劳罗的手下杀害了他年迈的母亲，杀害了他的叔叔，射伤了他的兄弟（他幸存了下来），射杀了他兄弟的妻子（她去世了），并试图通过将其锁在浴室并纵火（她通过窗户逃脱并离开了城镇）来杀害一个姐妹。迪劳罗对这些行动感到愤怒。针对无辜家庭成员——特别是老妇人——的针对行为构成了对卡莫拉规范的严重违反。更糟的是，这场戏引起了对北部地区的关注。迪劳罗通过将杀害那位妇女的人逐个击毙，以及下令停火来恢复了控制，但危险的问题已经被提出，不会消失。
- en: Three months later, in August 1992, the police found Ruocco in Milan, where
    he had been cowering in fear of Di Lauro’s wrath. He jumped from a third-floor
    window when the police arrived, landed badly, and ended up in prison, where after
    a period of silence he began spilling the Camorra’s secrets, including the story
    of La Monica’s murder. It was the state’s first break, but a lousy one. After
    much confusion and fuss, all that came of Ruocco’s cooperation was his own conviction
    for conspiracy. By 1994 the ruckus had died down. According to Simone Di Meo,
    this was the moment when the Italian press first identified Di Lauro and his clan.
    If so, the police weren’t reading the papers, because the detectives who later
    ran the seven-year investigation that ultimately brought Di Lauro down told me
    that at the start, in 1995, they had never heard of the man by name.

- en: 'Unbeknownst to the police, Di Lauro had trouble again, in 1997, when some of
    his men killed a Licciardi nephew in what began as a quarrel over a woman in a
    bar, and the Licciardis responded by nailing a death list of 17 Di Lauro associates
    to a church door. It is said that Di Lauro himself ordered some of those on the
    list to be killed to show his good faith, but it seems more likely that he simply
    acquiesced in their fates. The list stayed on the door until a priest took it
    down. Most of the named 17 survived. For whatever reason, the two groups veered
    away from war and continued their wary coexistence as before. There was a lot
    of money being made. By now the police knew of a man named Di Lauro who was a
    local Camorrista, but they had no photographs of him and did not understand his
    role. They thought he was at most a mere captain, and in the Licciardi clan. A
    few detectives worked the case full-time. They kept tapping phones and trying
    to piece together the puzzle. Rarely could they understand what was being said:
    the communications were not merely guarded but illiterate and insular, like an
    entire micro-language that had to be learned. By plotting the connections, they
    eventually realized they were dealing with a pyramidal structure. They heard frequent
    references to someone named Pasquale. Sometimes he was called “the Rabbit Man.”
    This may have meant that he had a large family or that he was fast. It seemed
    that he was the boss.'

- en: The break in the case was an accident. In 1998 at an elementary school in the
    center of Secondigliano, a teacher shouted at a young Di Lauro cousin for misbehaving
    in class, and one of Di Lauro’s sons—a 10-year-old named Antonio—took his cousin’s
    defense by standing up and shouting back. The teacher reacted by giving Antonio
    a slap. Word of the incident traveled fast. It is said that when the boy got home
    Di Lauro scolded him for misbehaving. Others in the clan, however, felt that the
    family had been insulted. Three of them went to the school, sought out the teacher,
    and slapped him as he had slapped Di Lauro’s son—or perhaps a little more. It
    is obvious that Di Lauro would never have sent them, but when the teacher filed
    an official complaint, the police took the occasion to summon Di Lauro to the
    district station for a conversation. He entered the station peacefully, leaving
    some associates outside, and was whisked to police headquarters in central Naples,
    where he denied any knowledge of the assault and claimed to be a shopkeeper. The
    police had to release him, but not before they took some mug shots—face forward
    and in profile—which now count among the few Di Lauro pictures that exist. Here
    he is in an open-necked blue shirt at age 45, emerging unwillingly from the shadows—balding,
    a bit fat, clean-shaven, impressively self-contained. He is a stoic at the height
    of his power. There is something in his composure—with the hint of a smile that
    is not a smile, and eyes subtly diverted from the camera—that conveys an unwavering
    autonomy. He sometimes insisted that he did not oppose the government, but it
    is clear in these pictures why the government should have feared him.

    Lauro因其调皮而斥责他。然而，家族中其他人认为他们家受到了侮辱。其中三人前往学校寻找老师，对他施加了和他对待Di Lauro儿子一样的耳光——或许稍微更重。显而易见，Di
    Lauro本人绝不会派他们去，但是当老师正式投诉时，警方趁机召集Di Lauro到地区警察局进行交谈。他平静地走进警局，留下几个同伴在外，然后被带到那不勒斯市中心的警察总部，在那里他否认知道袭击事件，并声称自己是一名店主。警方不得不释放他，但在此之前他们拍了些照片——正面和侧面——这些如今被视为极为罕见的Di
    Lauro图片之一。在这里，他穿着敞领的蓝色衬衫，年龄45岁，不情愿地从阴影中走出来——头发稀少，有些胖，干净-shaven，令人印象深刻地自我控制。他是一位站在权力巅峰的坚忍者。他的镇定中有着一种不是微笑的微笑的暗示，以及眼睛微妙地转向摄像机——这表达了他坚定不移的自主性。他有时坚称自己不反对政府，但在这些照片中很明显，政府为何应对他感到恐惧。

    Lauro’s station visit, it suddenly became clear that Pasquale and Di Lauro were
    the same man, and therefore that Di Lauro, who was formerly seen as a minor character,
    was in fact a king. Di Lauro had long expected this disaster to strike. As a student
    of life he could not have been surprised that it was over an incident as minor
    as a spat with a teacher at school. Now that he could no longer hide in plain
    view, he withdrew even more deeply into his private world and began a peripatetic
    existence, moving between barren apartments in the district and only occasionally
    sleeping at home. Sometimes he traveled abroad to make deals and to gamble. When
    he returned he never mentioned where he had been or what he had done. No one cared
    so long as he remained in charge. He was sharing his wealth throughout Secondigliano
    and beyond. Many people believed that the state was too weak to touch him. Di

- en: The problem for the police was that no witnesses came forward to speak against
    the clan. This left the investigators to proceed in the most tedious manner—by
    continuing to tap the clan’s phone calls (finally 7,990 conversations in all)
    and entering the evidence piecemeal into thick files for later review by a prosecuting
    judge. They had to meet the standards of Italian anti-Mafia laws similar to the
    American RICO statutes, which target direct association with criminal syndicates
    and allow for murder prosecutions based on command responsibility. Building the
    case took a full four years after the teacher-slapping incident, but in October
    2002 orders were finally issued for the arrest of Paolo Di Lauro and 61 members
    of the clan. Within months, many of these people were picked up and jailed. Some
    of them were very close to Di Lauro, including Di Lauro’s second-oldest son. As
    for Di Lauro himself, he was nowhere to be found. For several years he was on
    the run. People claimed to have spotted him in Marseilles, Athens, London, and
    Milan. Some newspapers reported that he had died. But his lawyer told me that
    not only was he alive but he had remained in Secondigliano the entire time. When
    I asked his lawyer why, he spread his hands as if to say, It’s obvious. He said,
    “He loved his family.” In fact, it was during his years as a fugitive that he
    and his wife conceived their 11th and final child. The lawyer told me he had wondered
    aloud if the child would perhaps at last be a girl, and Di Lauro answered that
    he could not even mention this to his wife because she might take the question
    as a criticism for not yet having provided him with a daughter. He was that in
    love with her, still. He cared for nothing if he did not care for his family.

    事实上，正是在他作为逃犯的几年中，他和妻子怀了他们的第十一个也是最后一个孩子。律师告诉我，他曾经大声猜想这个孩子可能最终会是个女孩，迪劳罗回答说，他甚至不能向他的妻子提起这个问题，因为她可能会把这个问题看作是对她还没有生下女儿的批评。他对她依旧如此深爱。如果不是为了他的家人，他什么都不在乎。
- en: In May 2004 one of his sons was killed in a motor-scooter accident. He was a
    passenger on the back, riding without a helmet. Di Lauro was devastated and became
    ineffectual for a while. This may help to explain why at around this time he made
    the greatest error of his life, when he decided to hand over power to a child
    he loved beyond reason, Cosimo, his firstborn son. Cosimo, aged 30, was a full-blown
    psychopath known for brutality. He wore long, stringy hair and black clothes in
    imitation of a gothic fantasy character from the movie *The Crow.* He kept a Lamborghini
    in Paris. He was a heartthrob for lower-class girls, who were thrilled by his
    aggression and his style. For much the same reason he was surrounded by a crew
    of young gunmen full of swagger. Cosimo had been involved in Camorra business
    since his teenage years and had recently concluded that the clan’s principal associates,
    the long-honored franchisees, had grown too independent and greedy, and that his
    father—a mere accountant, after all—had lacked the courage to take them on. All
    that was going to change, now that he was in charge. Henceforward all drug supplies
    would be purchased exclusively from the Di Lauro family, and associates would
    essentially become its employees, to be paid as Cosimo saw fit, and under his
    control. Any who objected would be replaced—one way or another. It was obvious
    that the old-timers were not going to accept these terms, nor, for that matter,
    could they accept the authority of such an immature leader. Through an intermediary,
    Di Lauro ordered his son to desist. The intermediary said, “I bring a message
    from your father. Do not do this war.” It was too late. Cosimo answered, “Papa
    doesn’t count anymore.”

    name. The fighting broke out in late 2004\. In Secondigliano and Scampia that
    fall and winter at least 54 people were killed, sometimes several in a day. Paolo
    Di Lauro must have looked on in disgust and dismay. On one occasion, the former
    girlfriend of a Secessionist was captured by Cosimo’s men, who tortured her (in
    vain) to get her to divulge her boyfriend’s location, then murdered her and burned
    her body in a car. People were outraged even within the clan and they talked:
    this was Cosimo’s doing. The police issued orders for Cosimo’s arrest. He went
    into hiding in Secondigliano but sent so many text messages to various girlfriends
    that he was tracked down within a few weeks. When the police broke in, he was
    not armed. He went to a mirror to comb his hair back, and he put on a black leather
    coat to complement his black sweater and jeans. It was a January afternoon in
    2005\. By the time the police got him downstairs, several hundred neighborhood
    women had converged on the site and begun to riot. They dropped a toilet on the
    police from an upper-floor window, threw all manner of objects at them, and burned
    two police cars. Cosimo emerged into this scene, flanked by policemen, and stared
    directly into the cameras of the press. He was like a rock star playing to the

    the Secessionists who had fled their apartments could return at no risk to live
    in Secondigliano again. Three: Paolo Di Lauro would admit that his family had

    between the Secessionists and the Di Lauro clan—now headed by another son—and
    seven people were murdered. The dynamics of the violence were extremely complex.
    It is believed that some of the dead may have been killed by the Licciardi to
    incite fighting by the two other sides. In the summer of 2007 it happened again,
    and 11 high-ranking Di Lauro associates were killed. That same year a group of
    loyalists who had stuck with the clan through the worst of the troubles finally
    broke off in disgust and assumed independent control of the central alley in Secondigliano,

    of the Camorra in Naples, as it has always been. There are periods of chaos, followed
    by peaceful times when men like Di Lauro rise, followed by chaos again when men
    like Di Lauro fall. The remnants of his clan are headed now by a son named Marco,
    a fugitive from the law, who is widely disrespected for being foolish and weak.
    Somewhere in Naples, in some other family, the next great leader in all likelihood
    has already been born, but until he emerges onto the scene demonstrating particular
    strength and wisdom he cannot be identified. Meanwhile, for those in the game
    in Secondigliano and Scampia, there are so many different ways to die, and every
    one of them is a surprise.

  zh: 这是那不勒斯的卡莫拉模式，一直如此。有混乱的时期，然后是像迪劳罗这样的人物崛起，再然后是再次的混乱，当像迪劳罗这样的人物倒台。他的残余势力现在由一个名叫马可的儿子领导，他是法律的逃犯，因为愚蠢和软弱而广受轻视。在那不勒斯某处，很可能已经有下一个伟大领袖出生了，但在他展示特殊力量和智慧之前，他不能被确认。与此同时，在Secondigliano和Scampia参与游戏的人们，有很多种不同的死法，每一种都是一个惊喜。
- en: The government wanders this terrain on its own uncertain missions. You have
    to wonder what it is trying to achieve when, for instance, it stops some people
    for questioning on the streets, or throws others in prison forever. In a place
    like Italy—where the recent prime minister condones tax evasion as a natural right
    and publicly impugns the courts—it becomes hard to believe that police actions
    are sincerely about law and order, or that officials still believe that law and
    order matter. As warfare raged within the Camorra, Italy itself was teetering
    on the edge of economic collapse and threatening to drag the rest of Europe with
    it—and largely because of mismanagement by a succession of corrupt and cynical
    governments. One day in Naples I was told of a police raid under way against what
    was left of the Di Lauro clan in Secondigliano. I rushed to Rioni dei Fiori and
    came upon an opera, with a helicopter thumping overhead and the streets guarded
    by uniformed officers for blocks around. At the center of the operation stood
    the piazza itself, a typically filthy apartment complex built around a central
    square littered with trash and stained with at least one large smear of human
    excrement. The clan had obviously heard about the raid in advance and had quietly
    shut its operations for the day. As a result, there were no drugs to be found,
    no arrests to be made. Firemen broke down a steel door and removed some fortifications
    that the clan had installed at the two access gates to the courtyard. Then the
    raid was over. The man in charge was a detective. I asked him what purpose the
    raid had served. “It was a show of state power,” he said. “Of making the dealers
    flee like rats. It was a public humiliation. That was the purpose. But we are
    not stupid. We know they will come back to take over the piazza and control the
    gates again. Probably by tomorrow. Look, we can squeeze the Camorra, but we know
    we can’t stop it.”

  zh: 政府在这片领土上孤军奋战，其行动充满不确定性。当他们在街头拦截某些人进行询问，或者无限期关押其他人时，你不禁要问，他们究竟想达到什么目的。在意大利这样的地方——最近的总理竟然认为逃税是一种天然权利，并公开质疑法院——人们很难相信警察的行动是真心为了维护法律和秩序，或者官员们还相信法律和秩序的重要性。当卡莫拉内部的战争激烈进行之际，意大利本身正处在经济崩溃的边缘，威胁着拖累整个欧洲，而这很大程度上是由一连串腐败和愤世嫉俗的政府管理不善所致。有一天，在那不勒斯，我听说第二利亚诺地区还剩下的迪劳罗家族正在接受警察的突袭。我赶到了费奥里街区，看到一场大戏正在上演，直升飞机在头顶嗡嗡作响，街道上每隔几个街区就有穿着制服的警官把守。整个行动的中心是广场本身，一个典型的肮脏公寓群，围绕着一个中央广场，到处都是垃圾，至少有一个大的人类粪便污迹。家族显然已经提前听到了突袭的消息，并悄悄地关闭了当天的活动。因此，没有发现毒品，也没有逮捕行动。消防队员撬开了一扇钢门，并拆除了家族在两个通道门口安装的一些防御设施。然后突袭就此结束。负责的是一位侦探。我问他突袭的目的是什么。“这是国家权力的一次展示”，他说，“是让贩毒者像老鼠一样逃跑的公开羞辱。这就是目的。但我们不傻。我们知道他们会回来重新控制广场和大门。可能明天就会回来。看，我们可以挤压卡莫拉，但我们知道我们不能阻止它。”
- en: 'And maybe that doesn’t matter. People may wring their hands about the horror
    of it all, but this is Naples, one of the great alternatives to modern life. It
    is possible that the world should no more root out the Camorra than make Neapolitans
    operate on time. And then there is the practical side. An anti-Mafia judge told
    me that some of the police—even those who have not been corrupted—would rather
    not see the government prevail, because they fear the even greater disorder that
    would result. Another judge pointed out to me that the government needs the Camorra
    for social control. He said, “For a political leader, it’s easier to speak to
    a Camorra boss than to 100,000 people to get a message across.” More than that,
    he said: the Camorra sets standards, enforces laws, keeps police power itself
    in check, fends off aggressive tax collectors, employs a huge percentage of the
    population, creates and distributes wealth more efficiently than any other sector
    of society, and stands in to keep things going, especially in times like these,
    when the national economy has failed and the currency itself is at risk.'

  zh: 或许这并不重要。人们可能会为这一切的恐怖而揪心，但这是那不勒斯，是现代生活的一个伟大替代方案。可能世界不应该根除卡莫拉，就像不应该让那不勒斯人按时运行一样。然后还有实际的一面。一位反黑帮法官告诉我，一些警察甚至那些没有被腐败的警察宁愿不看到政府胜利，因为他们担心更大的混乱将会发生。另一位法官向我指出，政府需要卡莫拉来进行社会控制。他说，“对于政治领导人来说，与一个卡莫拉老大交谈比向10万人传达信息更容易。”他还说：卡莫拉制定了标准，执行法律，使警察力量自我检查，抵御侵略性的税收征收者，雇佣了人口的大部分，比社会的任何其他部门更有效地创造和分配财富，并且在像这样的时候，特别是在国家经济失败和货币本身处于风险之时，卡莫拉起着维持事务运转的作用。
- en: It’s hardly the system you would dream up in a civics class. Nonetheless the
    Camorra serves society best when it is strong. The judges I spoke to all recognized
    this truth, and yet these were the same people who had taken Di Lauro down. I
    asked them if they believed in the superiority of the Italian state, and all but
    one replied no. That one said, to paraphrase, “We have no choice. The Camorra
    has created an anti-state whose very existence threatens the legitimacy of the
    Italian state. If the courts did not act, they would not be real. If the courts
    are not real, Italy will not endure. Our role is not to prevail over the Camorra
    but to go through the motions of trying.” I mentioned this to a Camorra defense
    lawyer. She knew the judge in question. She said, “The anti-state is the state
    itself. It is the state, not the Camorra, that is strangling Italy.” She seemed
    to prefer the criminals to the officials. Most Neapolitans would agree. They demonstrate
    daily the extent to which they can live without Italy. And if Di Lauro ever came
    back, their celebrations would shut down the city.

  zh: 这绝非你在公民课上梦想的体制。尽管如此，卡莫拉在其强大时为社会服务最好。我与的法官们都承认了这一事实，然而这些人也是将迪劳罗击败的人。我问他们是否相信意大利国家的优越性，除了一个人回答“否”外，其他人都回答“否”。那个人说，换句话说，“我们别无选择。卡莫拉已经创造了一个反国家，其存在本身就威胁着意大利国家的合法性。如果法院不采取行动，它们就不会是真实的。如果法院不真实，意大利将无法持久。我们的角色不是要战胜卡莫拉，而是要假装试图努力。”我把这件事告诉了一个卡莫拉辩护律师。她认识涉及的法官。她说，“反国家本身就是国家。是国家，而不是卡莫拉，正在扼杀意大利。”她似乎更喜欢罪犯而不是官员。大多数那不勒斯人会同意。他们每天展示出他们可以无视意大利的程度。如果迪劳罗回来，他们的庆祝活动将关闭这个城市。
- en: That will probably never happen. Di Lauro will turn 59 this year in a maximum-security
    prison 40 miles northwest of Rome in the town of Viterbo. He is being held there
    under a prison regime called 41-bis—a program of severe and indefinite isolation
    by which Mafia leaders can be kept under 24-hour surveillance, cut off from contact
    even with guards, denied access to national or regional news, and allowed visits
    only from their lawyers and, for one hour a month—behind plate glass, by monitored
    phone—a designated member of their immediate family accompanied only by those
    children who are minors. The primary intent is to separate Mafia leaders from
    their organizations, and to prevent them from directing operations from within
    the prisons. The resulting conditions, however, are so extreme that in 2007 the
    European Court of Human Rights held that certain aspects are in violation of the
    European Convention on Human Rights, and that same year a U.S. judge refused to
    extradite a heroin trafficker to Italy because of concerns that 41-bis would be
    applied to him and might constitute torture. Indeed, the regime, which is easily
    lifted when the government chooses, has repeatedly served a coercive purpose,
    ultimately persuading a line of hardened men to give evidence to the courts in
    return for relief from the promise of eternal solitude.

  zh: 这种情况可能永远不会发生。迪劳罗今年将在罗马西北40英里外的维泰博镇的一所最高安全监狱度过他的59岁生日。他被关押在那里，受到了称为41-bis的监狱制度的限制——这是一种严厉且无限期的孤立措施，使黑手党领袖可以全天候受到监视，与卫兵甚至都不能接触，被拒绝接触国家或地区新闻，只能接见他们的律师，每个月只能通过监控电话与其家庭中特定成员进行一小时的会面——在钢化玻璃后面，只能陪同未成年子女。其主要目的是将黑手党领导人与其组织分开，并防止他们从监狱内指挥操作。然而，由此产生的条件极端到2007年欧洲人权法院认定某些方面违反了欧洲人权公约，同年，美国法官因担心41-bis会被应用于他而拒绝将一个海洛因走私犯引渡到意大利，认为这可能构成酷刑。事实上，这种制度在政府选择时很容易被取消，但一再起到强制作用，最终说服了一系列坚强的人向法院提供证据，以换取免于永远孤立的承诺。
- en: But Di Lauro is not one of them. It is not clear whether he has anything to
    read. I have been told that he spends his time in contemplation, chain-smoking
    cigarettes. It is an extraordinarily disciplined response. He knows that he can
    end the suffering if he begins to talk, but this he refuses to do. Instead, he
    has chosen the opposite course, an even greater extreme than 41-bis imposes, and
    has begun refusing not only any further contact with lawyers, but also the monthly
    conversation he is allowed with his wife. He must still love her, but he is the
    master of silence. Trapped by the state, he remains the master of himself.

  zh: 但迪劳罗不是其中之一。目前尚不清楚他是否有什么可以阅读的东西。有人告诉我，他抽着烟沉思。这是一种非常有纪律的反应。他知道如果开始讲话就能结束痛苦，但他拒绝这样做。相反，他选择了与41-bis规定的极端相反的道路，并开始不仅拒绝与律师的进一步接触，还拒绝了每月与妻子的允许的交流。他仍然必定爱着她，但他是沉默的主人。被国家困住，他仍然是自己的主人。
