    mansion](https://www.businessinsider.com/see-inside-investor-marc-andreessens-33-million-house-for-sale-2024-3)
    in Atherton, California, which has seven fireplaces, up for sale for $33.75 million.
    This was done to [spend more time](https://traded.co/deals/california/single-family-residence/sale/27724-pacific-coast-highway/),
    one supposes, at the $177 million home he owns in Paradise Cove, California; or
    the $34 million one he bought beside it; or the $44.5 million one in a place called
    Escondido Beach. Upon reading this, I realized it was time to stop procrastinating
    and tell you all a story I’ve been meaning to set down for a long time now about
    the time I visited that house (the cheap $33.75 million one, I mean). Strictly
    on a need-to-know basis. Because you *really* need to know how deeply twisted
    some of these plutocrats who run our society truly are.

    with his book club, which also happened to be Marc Andreessen’s book club. They
    offered a free flight and hotel; I accepted. We met in that house. I was vaguely
    aware of Andreessen as the guy who invented the first web browser, a socially
    useful accomplishment by any measure and a story I had long kept in the back of
    my mind as an outstanding proof text that useful invention often flourishes best
    when government subsidizes it, socialism-style—given that Andreessen had [created
    it while a student at a public institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator),
    the University of Illinois. Then I boned up on what he was up to now, courtesy
    of a gargantuan 13,000-word [profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man)

    with beliefs” and is “afire to reorder life as we know it.” His enthusiasms included
    replacing money with cryptocurrency; replacing cooked food with a scheme called,
    yes, “Soylent,” and boosting the now-invisible Oculus virtual reality headset.

    a major stockholder in Facebook and a member of the civilian board that helped
    oversee the Central Intelligence Agency. Much later, it was in a tweet of his

    achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential.”
    (The residents of Nagasaki and Hiroshima might once have wished to disagree.)
    “For hundreds of years, we properly glorified this—until recently.” (Really? I
    only wish I could escape the glorification for one goddamned day.) “We believe
    everything good is downstream of growth.” (*Everything*?) And “there is no material

    fellow who began scooping up commercial real estate in the bedraggled lands around
    Stanford University that became Silicon Valley, becoming its pre-eminent landowner,
    which is kind of how aristocracies start in the dim mists of time. I reflected,

    an Agnes Martin! … A Claes Oldenburg maquette! He’s one of my favorites!” And

    the “cultural desert” of Silicon Valley—the “[pop-up gallery](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22pace+gallery%22+tesla+Arrillaga-Andreessen)”
    she organized with a Manhattan powerhouse art dealer at her father’s Tesla dealership
    was covered in the art press as something like a philanthropic venture. But progress
    was apparently sluggish; Arrillaga-Andreessen seemed absurdly grateful to finally
    have a guest who knew who these artists were. Quietly, I reflected upon how odd
    it is that people who claim to love art, and sharing it with the world, would
    lock masterpieces away for only themselves and their guests to enjoy. Among aristocrats,
    I suppose, it has ever been thus.
