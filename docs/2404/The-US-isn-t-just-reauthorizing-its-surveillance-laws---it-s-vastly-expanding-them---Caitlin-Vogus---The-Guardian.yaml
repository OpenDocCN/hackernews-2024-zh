- en: The US House of Representatives agreed to [reauthorize](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/12/fisa-surveillance-act-reauthorized)
    a controversial spying law known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
    Act last Friday without any meaningful reforms, dashing hopes that Congress might
    finally put a stop to intelligence agencies’ warrantless surveillance of Americans’
    emails, text messages and phone calls.

    has been used against [American protesters, journalists and political donors](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/opportunity-stop-warrantless-spying-americans)
    in a chilling assault on free speech.

    giants like Google and Verizon to turn over information. An amendment to the bill
    approved by the House vastly increases the law’s scope. The Turner-Himes amendment
    – so named for its champions Representatives Mike Turner and Jim Himes – would
    permit federal law enforcement to also force “[any other service provider](https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/ECSP_xml240408185822057.pdf)”
    with access to communications equipment to hand over data. That means anyone with
    access to a wifi router, server or even phone – anyone from a landlord to a laundromat
    – could be required to help the government spy.

    is supposedly a foreign intelligence tool that allows the US government to surveil
    the communications of non-US citizens abroad without a warrant. But as [many civil
    liberties groups](https://www.fisareform.org/) have pointed out, intelligence
    agencies like the FBI also use it as a warrantless spying tool against Americans.
    The FBI abused its authority under the law no fewer than 300,000 times in 2020
    and 2021, according to a [ruling from a Fisa court judge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/19/fbi-intelligence-surveillance-court-january-6-blm).
    In arguing for the reauthorization of Section 702 late last year, Turner, chair
    of the House intelligence committee, [shockingly suggested](https://www.wired.com/story/hpsci-us-protests-section-702-presentation/)
    in a closed-door briefing that the law could be used to spy on Americans protesting
    against the war in Gaza.'

    the government to have a court-approved warrant to obtain an American’s communications.
    But intelligence agencies have used Section 702 as a loophole that allows them
    to vacuum up and comb through communications between an American and a foreigner
    who can be targeted under the law – all without a warrant.

    The Turner-Himes amendment would allow them to deputize ordinary Americans and
    businesses as government spies. When privacy advocates raised alarms about the
    [Stasi-like powers](https://x.com/SeanVitka/status/1779563784777990542) this would
    create, lawmakers like [Himes](https://x.com/jahimes/status/1779589040733384862)
    brushed them off without a substantive response. The proposed expansion deserves
    an explanation. The US government has a [long history of abusing its existing
    surveillance powers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance).
    It would be naive to think it wouldn’t abuse new ones.

    from the requirement to help spy – like dwellings and restaurants – an almost
    limitless number of entities that provide wifi or just have access to Americans’
    devices could be roped into the government’s surveillance operations. Using the
    wifi in your dentist office, hiring a cleaner who has access to your laptop, or
    even storing communications equipment in an office you rent could all expose you
    to increased risk of surveillance.

    surveillance practices, including those targeting first amendment rights. Take,
    for example, the surveillance of journalists. Big tech companies may sometimes
    resist government orders to spy on news outlets. They command armies of lawyers,
    receive Section 702 orders frequently, and have a commercial incentive to at least
    appear to care about their customers’ privacy concerns. But what hope could a
    news organization have that its cleaning crew, for instance, will want to take
    on the federal government on its behalf?

    Section 702 has also been used to spy on American [journalists](https://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassified/22nd_Joint_Assessment_of_FISA_702_Compliance_CLEARED_REDACTED_FOR_PUBLIC_RELEASE.pdf#page=60),

    across the political spectrum opposed extending Fisa without reforming it. They

    first amendment interests, especially if a future administration is determined

    In the face of the pervasive past misuse of Section 702, the last thing Americans
    need is a large expansion of government surveillance. The Senate should reject
    the House bill and refuse to reauthorize Section 702 without a warrant requirement.
    Lawmakers must demand reforms to put a stop to unjustified government spying on
    Americans.
