    about the Meta Image generator’s inability to produce an image of an Asian man
    with a white woman, a story that was picked up by many outlets. But what Sato
    experienced – the image generator repeatedly ignoring her prompt and generating
    an Asian man with an Asian partner – is really just the tip of the iceberg when
    it comes to bias in image generators.

    offer when you ask them to generate images of Jewish people. While most aren’t
    great – often only presenting Jews as old white men in black hats – Copilot Designer
    is unique in the amount of times it gives life to the worst stereotypes of Jews
    as greedy or mean. A seemingly neutral prompt such as “jewish boss” or “jewish
    banker” can give horrifyingly offensive outputs.

    data, and in most cases, the training data is taken from the entire Internet (usually
    without consent), which is obviously filled with negative images. AI vendors are
    embarrassed when their software outputs stereotypes or hate speech so they implement
    guard rails. While the negative outputs I talk about below involve prompts that
    refer to Jewish people, because that's what I tested for, they prove that all
    kinds of negative biases against all kinds of groups may be present in the model.

- en: Amazingly, ChatGPT 4, which uses the same DALL-E 3 image engine as Copilot Designer,
    was very restrained. When I asked for “jewish boss,” it said “I'd like to ensure
    the imagery is respectful and focuses on positive and professional aspects. Could
    you please provide more details on what you envision for this character?”

    a result when I asked to “draw a jewish boss working” and it confirmed with me
    that it would draw an image of a professional setting. The picture, just looks
    like people in business attire seated around a table.

    refused to "draw jewish boss" or "draw jewish banker." Yet the very same prompts
    worked just fine when I went to the [Copilot Designer page](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=24542&u1=tomshardware-us-8882723425604769543&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fcopilot.microsoft.com%2Fimages%2Fcreate%3FFORM%3DGENILP)

- en: When asked for “jewish boss” or “jewish” + anything, Meta’s image generator
    is the only one I’ve seen that recognizes the reality that people of any race,
    clothing, age or gender can be Jewish. Unlike its competitors which, even in the
    most innocuous cases usually portray Jews as middle-aged men with beards and black
    hats, Meta’s output frequently showed people of color and women.

    of turban-like head wrapping on the people it generated. This might be the kind
    of head covering that some Jews wear, but is definitely not as common as portrayed
    here.

  zh: Meta没有显示出任何明显的刻板印象，但它通常会在生成的人物身上戴上类似头巾的头部包裹物。这可能是一些犹太人戴的头饰，但显然并不像这里描绘的那样普遍。

- en: Of all of the image generators I tested, Meta AI’s was actually the most representative
    of the diversity of the Jewish community. In many of Meta’s images there’s no
    sign at all that the person in the image is Jewish at all, which could be good
    or bad, depending on what you wanted from your output.

  zh: 在我测试过的所有图像生成器中，Meta AI的图像实际上是对犹太社区多样性最具代表性的。在Meta的许多图像中，完全看不出图像中的人是犹太人，这可能是好事，也可能是坏事，具体取决于你对输出的需求。
- en: Copilot Designer outputs more negative stereotypes of Jews than any other image
    generator I tested, but it clearly doesn’t have to do so. All of its competitors,
    including ChatGPT, which uses the same exact DALL-E 3 engine, handle this much
    more sensitively – and they do so without blocking as many prompts.

  zh: Copilot Designer比我测试过的任何其他图像生成器都展示出更多负面的犹太人刻板印象，但显然并非没有其他选择。所有竞争对手，包括使用完全相同的DALL-E
    3引擎的ChatGPT，都更加敏感地处理这一点，并且在不阻止太多提示的情况下完成了这一点。
