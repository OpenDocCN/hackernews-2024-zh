- en: Memory makers have halted disclosing contract prices of DRAM in Q2 2024, following
    a [major earthquake in Taiwan](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/taiwan-earthquake-causes-estimated-dollar62-million-damage-and-disruption-for-tsmc-euv-equipment-reported-to-be-safe-and-sound-report),
    which may point to potential price hikes. The earthquake disrupted wafer fab operations,
    impacting supply as Micron, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix are among those
    affected, reports [DigiTimes](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240403PD224.html).
    This situation may lead to sharper price increases than anticipated, as the industry
    was already aiming for higher prices before the quake, in a bid to recoup losses
    memory makers incurred in the previous years.

  zh: 在2024年第二季度，由于[台湾发生的重大地震](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/taiwan-earthquake-causes-estimated-dollar62-million-damage-and-disruption-for-tsmc-euv-equipment-reported-to-be-safe-and-sound-report)，记忆体制造商已停止披露DRAM的合约价格，这可能预示着价格上涨。地震中断了晶圆工厂的运作，影响了供应，Micron、三星电子和SK海力士等公司受到影响，据[DigiTimes](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240403PD224.html)报道。由于行业在地震前已在努力争取在之前年份遭受损失后提高价格，这种情况可能导致价格上涨超出预期。
- en: Micron ceased offering product quotes for the second quarter, shortly after
    the earthquake, with its Korean rivals quickly following suit. Industry insiders
    revealed that these leading memory chip manufacturers had already initiated measures
    to maintain a rising trend in their product prices before the April 3 quake. Now,
    it seems highly probable that the price hikes may be more pronounced than previously
    expected.

  zh: Micron在地震后不久停止了第二季度产品报价，其韩国竞争对手随即效仿。行业内部人士透露，这些领先的记忆芯片制造商在4月3日地震之前已经采取措施，以维持其产品价格的上升趋势。现在，价格上涨可能比之前预期的更为显著。
- en: In the past, memory prices have typically surged following production disruptions
    caused by natural calamities or accidents. The latest incident could provide the
    vendors with chances to compensate for the losses incurred in 2022 and 2023\.
    Prior to the quake, second-quarter DRAM and NAND flash contract prices were experiencing
    slower growth compared to the first quarter. Specifically, NAND flash prices had
    risen by 15% - 20% for the second quarter, as opposed to over 20% in the first
    quarter.

  zh: 在过去，由于自然灾害或事故导致生产中断，记忆体价格通常会激增。最新事件可能为供应商提供了补偿2022年和2023年遭受损失的机会。地震前，第二季度DRAM和NAND闪存合约价格增长速度比第一季度慢。具体来说，与第一季度超过20%的情况相比，NAND闪存价格在第二季度上涨了15%至20%。
- en: Following the earthquake, Micron announced that it would evaluate the impacts
    on its local production and supply chain. The company stated that it would then
    discuss supply schedules with its customers, hinting at potential changes in supply.
    Industry sources mentioned that memory fabs typically halt production during such
    strong earthquakes, which affects supply of memory wafers.

  zh: 地震后，Micron宣布将评估其本地生产和供应链的影响。该公司表示将与客户讨论供应时间表，暗示可能会有供应变动。行业消息源称，记忆体工厂通常在强烈地震期间停止生产，这影响了记忆体晶圆的供应。
- en: Memory module manufacturers, who are reportedly low on chip inventory, are now
    preparing for increased chip purchase costs. They had hoped that the rising price
    trends would decelerate, given the rising capacity utilization rates at chip suppliers.
    However, chip suppliers had significantly reduced production to sustain pricing
    last year, when demand was stagnant. Downstream customers, including server makers,
    might become aggressive in stocking memory products in anticipation of shortages,
    further driving up prices.

  zh: 据报道，存储模块制造商的芯片库存报告显示偏低，现正准备应对增加的芯片采购成本。他们曾希望随着芯片供应商的生产利用率上升，价格上涨的趋势会减缓。然而，去年需求停滞时，芯片供应商显著减少了生产以维持价格稳定。包括服务器制造商在内的下游客户可能会预期到供应短缺而积极备货，进一步推高价格。
- en: Although contract prices might be soaring, the spot market remains weak due
    to low demand from the consumer sector following the Lunar New Year. Apparently,
    there is still an abundant supply in the spot market, despite the disruptions
    and anticipated price hikes in the contract market, the report claims.
