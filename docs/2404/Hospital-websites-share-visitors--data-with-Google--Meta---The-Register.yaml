- en: Hospitals – despite being places where people implicitly expect to have their
    personal details kept private – frequently use tracking technologies on their
    websites to share user information with Google, Meta, data brokers, and other
    third parties, according to research published today.

    how they collect visitors' data and with whom they share it. But if they do have
    a privacy policy, they better make sure their processes on deleting personal information
