    your logs without writing LogQL. In this post, we’ll cover why we built Explore
    Logs and we’ll dive deeper into some of its features, including at-a-glance breakdowns
    by label, detected fields, and our new pattern detection. At the end, we’ll tell
    you how you can try Explore Logs for yourself today.

    provides a powerful query language called [LogQL](/blog/2022/05/12/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-logql/).
    Site reliability engineers (SREs) and other Loki experts love to use it to filter
    logs for specific keywords, reduce noise by selecting specific labels, and perform
    other operations to get answers to understand their systems.

    and [Grafana Incident,](/products/cloud/incident/) so you can make sure you get

    last thing you want to do is wrestle with yet another query language.

    that are used to organize and identify log streams. Labels are attached to log
    streams to help users query, filter, and aggregate logs efficiently. They are
    similar to tags or metadata in other logging systems.

    log messages when they’re ingested. Loki doesn’t index the content of log lines,
    but it can parse and extract fields from logs at query time. This feature allows
    users to query logs more efficiently by using these fields without the need to
    label every possible attribute as labels, which could be costly and inefficient.
  id: totrans-split-34

    A selection of the fields is automatically broken out into a grid view, and you
