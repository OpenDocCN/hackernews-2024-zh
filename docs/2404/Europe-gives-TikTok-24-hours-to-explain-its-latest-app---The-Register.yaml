    of the software emphasizes that it is a "smaller app" that requires "less data
    usage" – just the ticket for users with modest phones and download allowances.

    Breton, who [asked](https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1780585191108423941)
    "Is social media 'lite' as addictive and toxic as cigarettes 'light'?"

- en: The Commission wants to understand "the potential impact of the new 'Task and
    Reward Lite' program on the protection of minors, as well as on the mental health
    of users, in particular in relation to the potential stimulation of addictive
    behavior." Also on the to-do list handed to TikTok is information about the measures
    the service adopted to mitigate such systemic risks.

    its risk assessment of the Lite app, and the April 26 deadline for the other info
    outlined above. Which is sensible, given the DSA allows for colossal fines.

    its divestment to a non-Chinese entity passed the House of Representatives before
    stalling in the Senate – possibly to allow arrangements to be made that would
    not result in the app becoming unavailable stateside.
