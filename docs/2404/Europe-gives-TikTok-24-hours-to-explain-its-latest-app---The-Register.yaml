- en: The European Commission on Wednesday gave TikTok 24 hours to explain the risk
    assessment procedures it used before launching a version of the made-in-China
    app that rewards users for using it in certain ways.

- en: The app is called [TikTok Lite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.android.ugc.tiktok.lite&hl=en&gl=US)
    and offers the chance to "to complete challenging tasks and earn great rewards!"
  prefs: []

- en: Tasks include watching vids, liking content, or following other users. Rewards
    include Amazon vouchers, PayPal gift cards, or TikTok's in-app currency that can
    be used to tip other members.

- en: The Google Play store rates the app as suitable for teens, and TikTok's description
    of the software emphasizes that it is a "smaller app" that requires "less data
    usage" – just the ticket for users with modest phones and download allowances.

    Breton, who [asked](https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1780585191108423941)
    "Is social media 'lite' as addictive and toxic as cigarettes 'light'?"

    the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That law was [used](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_24_2103)
    to compel TikTok to explain how it considered risks its Lite app poses,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Commission wants to understand "the potential impact of the new 'Task and
    Reward Lite' program on the protection of minors, as well as on the mental health
    of users, in particular in relation to the potential stimulation of addictive
    behavior." Also on the to-do list handed to TikTok is information about the measures
    the service adopted to mitigate such systemic risks.

- en: TikTok has reportedly said it will comply with the overnight deadline to provide
    its risk assessment of the Lite app, and the April 26 deadline for the other info
    outlined above. Which is sensible, given the DSA allows for colossal fines.

    seen the EU [investigate](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/20/eu_tiktok_investigation/)
    whether the outfit is meeting its obligations to operate with transparency and
    to protect minors."

    its divestment to a non-Chinese entity passed the House of Representatives before
    stalling in the Senate – possibly to allow arrangements to be made that would
    not result in the app becoming unavailable stateside.
