    (Kuto's corpuses have a hashed timestamp, and you *do* have to set up your webserver
    to send the [right headers](https://web.dev/articles/love-your-cache) here).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result is that older clients will have bigger files, and newer clients will
    have smaller ones, even for the same filename. But that bigger file simply has
    now-deprecated code. Kuto's primary thesis is that disk I/O to load a slightly
    bigger file than you need is faster than compling anew.

  prefs:

    where cache is regularly evicted. If your visitors don't have your site cached,
    then Kuto *is* pointless‚Äîevery load is slightly more expensive for an update that
    never happens. YMMV.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless, the tool emits a few statistics, including how much overhead the
    initial load costing you, and what % of code is able to be identifed as having
    "no side effects" and put into a corpus. And to be clear, running Kuto on tiny
    codebases has no benefit‚Äîthe 'cost' of parsing a few kb of JS is trivial, even
    for potato phones. ü•î
