# Marriott admits it falsely claimed for five years it was using encryption during 2018 breach | CSO Online

Marriott did not issue a news release, nor did it flag the change on its homepage. Instead, it added two sentences to a page on its website from Jan. 4, 2019\. The only way for consumers, shareholders, reporters or anyone else to see it is if they happened to click on [the five-year-old page](https://news.marriott.com/news/2019/01/04/marriott-provides-update-on-starwood-database-security-incident). 

The two-sentence update reads: “Following an investigation with several leading data security experts, Marriott initially determined that the payment card numbers and certain passport numbers in the database tables involved in the Starwood database security incident that Marriott reported on November 30, 2018, were protected using Advanced Encryption Standard 128 encryption (AES-128). Marriott has now determined that the payment card numbers and some of the passport numbers in those tables were instead protected with a different cryptographic method known as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1).”

## Marriott has not said why it erroneously stated it had used AES-128

Marriott has thus far not answered any of the critical questions surrounding the admission. What made the company initially think that it had used AES-128, assuming that it did indeed believe that? After forensic investigations by outside firms — including Accenture, Verizon, and CrowdStrike — how did no one notice that there in fact had been no encryption in place? And if they did notice, why was Marriott repeating the false encryption claim? Perhaps most importantly, when and how did Marriott discover the truth?
