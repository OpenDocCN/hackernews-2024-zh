    for a few dozen spots in our toddler classrooms. Was this a testament to our high-quality
    Montessori program, our wonderful teachers, and our excellent admissions team?

- en: While it would be immensely gratifying to believe that our long waitlist was
    the result of our amazing efforts, it wouldn’t be 100% accurate. It’s true that
    many San Franciscan parents were willing to wait months and months for a spot
    in a high quality preschool—but that they had to wait so long reflected the fact
    that they had so few options available. In any other market, the obvious response
    to such scarcity would be to open up another preschool.

    I wrote about how bad land use rules have made it virtually impossible to build
    middle-class, family-friendly housing in most cities, which helped accelerate
    the trend of families moving to the suburbs during the pandemic. But a lack of
    available housing isn’t the only factor that influences families’ decisions to
    stay in or leave cities: schools and childcare also matter quite a lot, too. In
    addition to teaching academics, schools also provide a place for parents to put
    their kids during the workday, so the pandemic underscored just how vital the
    role of childcare was to family life. Yet long before the pandemic, expensive
    tuition and long waitlists were the norm at urban childcare centers.'

- en: The experience of my preschool in San Francisco was typical. Prior to relocating
    to the West Coast, I helped open a school in Brooklyn. Families were plunking
    down hefty tuition deposits two years in advance of our scheduled opening to secure
    spots in an as-yet-unbuilt school because of the city’s acute preschool shortage.
    One family even sent us a music video of their infant’s playful antics, in an
    amusing if futile attempt to boost his place on the waitlist. Supply constraints,
    driven in part by onerous land use rules and restrictions, contributed to making
    New York’s preschool market hyper-competitive, super-expensive, and a source of
    tremendous stress for families.

    so many families were already leaving cities like New York and San Francisco before
    Covid upended all our lives. This may be commonplace in cities—but it shouldn’t
    be considered normal.

- en: Urban land use policies contribute directly to abnormal preschool shortages
    through zoning and parking mandates. In many cities, childcare is considered a
    “conditional use” in most zoning districts, which means a potential childcare
    operator must go through a lengthy approval process to open. Conditional use permitting
    (CUP) processes add tremendous time, complexity, and uncertainty, driving up childcare
    opening costs that require operators to have deep pockets and good lawyers to
    navigate successfully.

    a “by right” use in as many zoning districts as possible, a move that now allows
    potential childcares to avoid a costly CUP process in nearly every part of the
    city. On the map below, which shows Austin before (left) and after (right) the
    reform, green is great—CUPs are only required in the yellow areas.

- en: Most land development codes also require a certain minimum amount of on-site
    parking. These laws force developers and businesses to build more parking than
    they need while also driving up construction costs, since each parking spot can
    cost up to tens of thousands of dollars to build—and those higher costs are eventually
    passed down to renters, buyers, and customers. Parking spaces compete for all
    other space, often shrinking building square footage and limiting outdoor space
    that could be put to better uses. These mandates also create some absurd situations,
    like requiring bars to have parking lots, essentially condoning if not encouraging
    drunk driving.

- en: In the case of childcare, parking mandates reduce the amount of space available
    for classrooms and playgrounds—which means fewer spaces for kids. In Austin, childcares
    were until recently required to provide one parking spot per employee, regardless
    of whether employees carpooled, bicycled, walked, or rode transit to work. Fortunately,
    Austin has now abolished parking mandates, giving developers the freedom to determine
    how much parking they need, which also makes many potential sites more viable
    for childcares (or other businesses).

- en: There are a lot of other rules that combine to make childcare as costly as college—including
    a host of state regulations that I’ll write more about in the future—but arbitrary,
    restrictive land use rules conspire to keep childcare rare and unaffordable in
    many cities. The availability of childcare (and good schools!) may be the most
    important amenity for urban parents, so such policies only serve to make urban
    life less desirable for young families.

- en: 'One more thing: “Cities Aren’t for Families” focused on land use policies that
    make housing family-unfriendly, but those same policies make housing more expensive
    *for*  *everybody*. If the folks who pay childcare tuition can’t afford to live
    in cities, it’s not any easier for the people who work at childcares. At my school
    in San Francisco, many of our teachers commuted in from the more affordable East
    Bay, some with commutes topping 90 minutes each way. Similarly in New York, almost
    all of our teachers commuted to our chic Brownstone Brooklyn location from more
    affordable neighborhoods farther away.'

    at some point, many of the teachers I worked with decided that they’d rather work
    closer to home. If schools and childcares cannot hire and retain staff due to
    the high cost of housing in cities, they will struggle or close, and families
    will leave. It all comes back to housing.

- en: By abolishing parking mandates and allowing childcares by right in most zoning
    districts, Austin has taken important steps to reducing the barriers that make
    it extremely difficult and expensive to open new childcare centers. If it also
    eases the restrictions that make it illegal to build family-friendly housing,
    it will have gone a long way toward making the city more livable for those families
    who would prefer to stay here.
