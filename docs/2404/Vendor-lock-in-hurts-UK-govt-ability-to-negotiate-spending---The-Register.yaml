    major cloud vendors signed under Memoranda of Understanding (MoU). For example,
    AWS, the world's largest cloud provider with a dominant market share, signed a
    deal worth up to [£450.3 million ($569.7 million) with the Home Office](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/01/uk_home_office_aws/)
    under the auspices of the [One Government Value Agreement (OGVA)](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/02/aws_signs_memorandum_of_understanding/).
    Other deals have been signed with tax collector HMRC and the Department for Work
    and Pensions, bagging AWS a total of around £900 million ($1.138 billion) under
    the MoU, which has since been updated to [OGVA 2.0](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/products-and-services/technology/technology-memorandum-of-understanding)
    and will run until October 2026.

    adoption, including the length of time it takes to adopt cloud services, as departments
    "typically experience a six-nine month period often costing £500k+ to activate
    and deploy" them. Its approach is also hampered by inconsistent cloud environments,
    which result in an "absence of a standardised approach" leading to "inconsistencies
    and reinventions of low-level cloud architecture, security, and compliance across
    departments, posing risks, inefficiencies and challenges of understanding equivalent
    controls in data sharing agreements."

    document proposes a solution which involves a "UK Public Sector Cloud Marketplace
    service," in partnership with major cloud providers. It would offer "consistently
