- en: The old Perl usenet newsgroup at comp.lang.perl.misc was partially for discussion,
    but was also for answers, and it was extremely hostile to beginners. It had a
    large FAQ, and the regulars regularly yelled at anyone who asked a question that
    was already answered. Understandable, because no one likes repeating themselves.
    But beginners are the ones least able to grok that whole thing, and beginners
    are the most likely to need help. The newsgroup set themselves up to be not helpful
    to the people who most needed help.

    under each function, sorted simply by most-recent-first, and goddamn if that didn’t
    answer most of my questions.)

    FAQ. [plonk](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/plonk.html)” comments disappeared
    under downvotes, and helpful comments were upvoted.

- en: At some point that “helpful” vibe changed. Stack Overflow ceased being a question
    and answer site, and begun calcifying into a documentation site. Questions are
    answered with “see this other answer”. There’s less rudeness than on usenet, but
    it’s approaching the same unhelpfullness.

    If you answer the question “correctly” once, why bother repeating yourself?

- en: But I think repetition of answers is healthy. It lets the next generation of
    programmers practice their ability to write clearly and answer questions. It lets
    them collect their upvotes and badges. It’s good to have a healthy funnel where
    beginners learn how to ask questions, veterans learn how to write answers, and
    super-veterans learn how to moderate.
