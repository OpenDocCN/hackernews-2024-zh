    I've seen a lot of technology. You know barely a week goes by without some new
    announcement, and if you look at the amount of AI hardware, the computers coming
    online that are dedicated to AI, that is increasing what looks like at least by
    a factor of 10 every year, if not every 6 to nine months. So when you combine
    the hardware coming online really an order of magnitude increase every you know—call
    it at least every nine months—and many, many software breakthroughs, if you look
    at that curve it looks insane. My guess is that we'll have AI that is smarter
    than any one human probably around the end of next year, and then AI, the total
    amount of sort of sentient compute of AI, I think will probably exceed all humans
    in 5 years.”
