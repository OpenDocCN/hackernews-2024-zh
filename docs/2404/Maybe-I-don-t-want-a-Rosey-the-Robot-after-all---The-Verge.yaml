- en: As a child of the 1980s, my perception of the smart home has been dominated
    by the idea that one day, we will all have Rosey the Robot-style robots roaming
    our homes — dusting the mantelpiece, preparing dinner, and unloading the dishwasher.
    (That last one is a must; we were smart enough to come up with a robot to wash
    our dishes; can’t we please come up with one that can also unload them?)

    unveiled this week, my childhood dreams are fast turning into a smart home nightmare.
    While *The Jetsons*’ robot housekeeper had a steely charm, accentuated by its
    frilly apron, the closer we come to having humanoid robots in our home, the more
    terrifying it appears they will be. Not so much because of how they look — I could
    see Atlas in an apron — but more because of what they represent.

- en: With its bipedal, hardcore yogi moves, Atlas is a new all-electric humanoid
    robot from Boston Dynamics. And while the next generation of the company’s Atlas
    program is designed for commercial use, they tout it as being capable of doing
    work that’s “too dangerous, too hard, or too dull and dirty” for us humans. Three
    of those things definitely apply to the home.

- en: While Atlas seems intentionally designed to feel menacing — or at least far
    from cuddly — the technology on show here makes it easy to connect the dots to
    the creation of a humanoid home robot. Nvidia is working on that very thing, recently
    announcing the launch of [Project GR00T Foundation model for humanoid robots](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/foundation-model-isaac-robotics-platform).
    “Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting
    problems to solve in AI today,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said
    of the launch. “The enabling technologies are coming together for leading roboticists
    around the world to take giant leaps towards artificial general robotics.”

    stuff of nightmares. The *Terminator* series embedded the fear of the robot uprising
    in the psyche of my generation, and things haven’t gotten much cheerier since.

    The question is, should we be working toward an all-capable, bipedal, human-like
    bot to take everyday chores off our hands? The more I think about it — and the
    more robots I have roaming around my home — the more I think the answer is no.
    We don’t need a robot that understands what we say and can replicate our movements;
    we need robots that do one job (or maybe two related jobs) and do them well.

- en: I have more experience than most with home robots. [Amazon’s Astro robot rolled
    around my house](/23141966/amazon-astro-robot-review) for two weeks. I’ve played
    with an ElliQ [companion robot](https://elliq.com/), tested dozens of [robot vacuums
    and mops](/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner), and currently have two [robot
    lawnmowers patrolling my garden](/2024/3/19/24105936/segway-navimow-i-robot-mower-price-release-date-specs).
    Not to mention the various smart speakers scattered around my home, packing artificial
    intelligence inside, including one with a [screen on a robotic arm](/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review)
    that swivels to face you when you talk to it (yes, it’s creepy). If there is a
    robot uprising on the cards, I’ll be the first to go.

    wreak havoc. I’ve had a robot lawnmower cut down my husband’s favorite plants
    and a robot vacuum knock over a chair, causing a domino effect that ended in a
    smashed window. Unsupervised mechanical devices moving around your home come with
    consequences, and the fewer responsibilities — and appendages — you give them,
    the less catastrophic those will be when things go wrong, and the better they
    will do the job they’re designed for.

    that can sauté the garlic and onions, these are the innovations I’d like to see.
    Some [have been attempted](/2018/1/10/16865506/laundroid-laundry-folding-machine-foldimate-ces-2018);
    others seem like the stuff of Samantha’s kitchen in *Bewitched*. All seem safer,
    simpler, and ultimately more comfortable than having a six-foot robot roaming
    around my house.

    recycle it and get a new one. When my humanoid robot housekeeper reaches the end
    of its firmware updates, I’ll have to put it out to pasture.

    has been decommissioned and is [now a fixture in the lobby of Boston Dynamics](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/technology/humanoid-robot-boston-dynamics-atlas-retires.html),
    I felt a tinge of sadness. It brought to mind the heartbreaking final moments
    of Kazuo Ishiguro’s excellent novel [*Klara and the Sun*](https://www.amazon.com/Klara-Sun-novel-Kazuo-Ishiguro/dp/059331817X?tag=theverge02-20).

    human-like intelligence — brings with it a whole host of complicated challenges
    around the nature of consciousness and the boundaries of humanity. This is not
    something I want to deal with when it comes to a dishwasher.
