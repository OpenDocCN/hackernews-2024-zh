- en: As a child of the 1980s, my perception of the smart home has been dominated
    by the idea that one day, we will all have Rosey the Robot-style robots roaming
    our homes — dusting the mantelpiece, preparing dinner, and unloading the dishwasher.
    (That last one is a must; we were smart enough to come up with a robot to wash
    our dishes; can’t we please come up with one that can also unload them?)

    unveiled this week, my childhood dreams are fast turning into a smart home nightmare.
    While *The Jetsons*’ robot housekeeper had a steely charm, accentuated by its
    frilly apron, the closer we come to having humanoid robots in our home, the more
    terrifying it appears they will be. Not so much because of how they look — I could
    see Atlas in an apron — but more because of what they represent.

- en: With its bipedal, hardcore yogi moves, Atlas is a new all-electric humanoid
    robot from Boston Dynamics. And while the next generation of the company’s Atlas
    program is designed for commercial use, they tout it as being capable of doing
    work that’s “too dangerous, too hard, or too dull and dirty” for us humans. Three
    of those things definitely apply to the home.

    from cuddly — the technology on show here makes it easy to connect the dots to
    the creation of a humanoid home robot. Nvidia is working on that very thing, recently
    announcing the launch of [Project GR00T Foundation model for humanoid robots](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/foundation-model-isaac-robotics-platform).
    “Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting
    problems to solve in AI today,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said
    of the launch. “The enabling technologies are coming together for leading roboticists
    around the world to take giant leaps towards artificial general robotics.”

- en: However, pop culture aside, it’s clear that robotics have a place in our homes.
    The question is, should we be working toward an all-capable, bipedal, human-like
    bot to take everyday chores off our hands? The more I think about it — and the
    more robots I have roaming around my home — the more I think the answer is no.
    We don’t need a robot that understands what we say and can replicate our movements;
    we need robots that do one job (or maybe two related jobs) and do them well.

  zh: 然而，抛开流行文化，很明显，机器人在我们家中有一席之地。问题是，我们应该努力开发一个全能、双足、人类化的机器人来接管日常家务吗？我越想越多——越有越多机器人在我家里漫步——我认为答案是否定的。我们不需要一个能理解我们说话并能复制我们动作的机器人；我们需要的是能做好一项工作（或者也许是两项相关工作）的机器人。

    intelligence inside, including one with a [screen on a robotic arm](/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review)
