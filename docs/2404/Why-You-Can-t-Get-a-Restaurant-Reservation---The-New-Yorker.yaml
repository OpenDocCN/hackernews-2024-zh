    science, regularly uses fake phone numbers and e-mail addresses to make reservations.
    When he calls Polo Bar, he told me, “Sometimes they recognize my voice, so I have
    to do different accents. I have to act like a girl sometimes.” He switched into
    a bad falsetto: “I’m, like, ‘Hiiii, is it possible to book a reservation?’ I have
    a few Resy accounts that have female names.” His recent sales on Appointment Trader,
    where his screen name is GloriousSeed75, include a lunch table at Maison Close,
    which he sold for eight hundred and fifty-five dollars, and a reservation at Carbone,
    the Village red-sauce place frequented by the Rolex-and-Hermès crowd, which fetched
    a thousand and fifty dollars. Last year, he made seventy thousand dollars reselling
    reservations.'

    I play ‘Dinner Reservations,’ ” he said. “It’s just a way to pass the time.” Last
    year, he made eighty thousand dollars reselling reservations. He’s good at anticipating
    what spots will be most in demand, and his profile on the site ranks him as having
    a “99% Positive Sales History” over his last two hundred transactions. It also
    notes that he made almost two thousand reservations that never sold—a restaurateur’s

    finds the eight-o’clock table at Bangkok Supper Club that it’s been programmed
    to grab. Instead of using a keyboard or mouse, the bot programmatically executes
    the reservation app’s underlying code. Some resellers subscribe to such sites

    reservations; some use open-source code posted on GitHub or write their own.

    restaurant. As Rebecca L. Spang writes in “[The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris
    and Modern Gastronomic Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Invention-Restaurant-Gastronomic-Culture-Historical/dp/0674006852),”
    in the eighteenth century, dining out in Paris or London meant going to a tavern
    where dinner was served at a common table, until the food ran out—first come,
    first served. In the U.S., reservations began to be more common sometime after
    the turn of the century, when it became popular to dine out for special occasions:
    Christmas, New Year’s Eve, Election Night. More commonly, wealthy men “reserved”
    private rooms at restaurants to entertain guests. (In New York, people vied to
    host the most elaborate private dinners: at one, the center of a huge table at
    Delmonico’s was removed and replaced with a water tank, for a centerpiece of four
    swans on loan from Prospect Park.)'

    rental cars, hotels, and airlines had moved advance booking online, Web sites
    like Savvydiner.com started brokering restaurant reservations. Diners would click
    a button, prompting a Savvydiner employee to telephone a restaurant’s maître d’,
    who scrawled the name in his book, next to all the other people who weren’t yet
    precipitating the end of an era.

    OpenTable.com—were competing to automate the process. Tavern on the Green’s owner,
    Warner LeRoy, started taking reservations on the restaurant’s Web site. Other
    restaurateurs were skeptical. OpenTable charged restaurants a monthly fee, plus
    a dollar for every guest seated. Asked by a reporter what he thought about online
    reservations, the director of operations at Danny Meyer’s Union Square Cafe scoffed,
    “There is no substitute for a kind, human voice on the phone.’’ But Meyer became
    an early investor in OpenTable, and, later, in Resy. Last year, he invested in
    an A.I.-powered reservation platform called SevenRooms, which most people haven’t
    heard about because it’s been designed for diners not to know it exists.

    they showed up without a reservation. In February, Hailey and her entourage had
    dinner at 4 Charles, after a private reservationist named Nicky DiMaggio secured
    them a table. DiMaggio, who charges between five hundred and a thousand dollars
    per reservation, owns a sanitation business with more than forty garbage trucks.
    He got into the reservation game when he was a teen-ager, after his cousin got
    him a reservation at Rao’s, the impregnable mob-flavored restaurant in East Harlem.
    He usually works with referrals. “My client list is, like, the N.B.A., Megan Fox,”
    he told me. (DiMaggio also claims that he has worked with reps for [Serena Williams](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-moments-from-serena-williamss-career-that-ill-never-forget),
    a son of Italy’s Vice-President, a manager at a Rolex store, and a lot of Goldman
    Sachs guys.) DiMaggio, who is thirty-three, books the tables in his own name (to
    protect his clients’ privacy, he says). Last year, he made more than a thousand
    reservations at the city’s trendiest restaurants; he claims to have cozied up
    to the owners and managers, who set aside tables for him. In reality, he has used
    Appointment Trader, just like everyone else.

    Using it is a little like buying a fistful of lottery tickets. Diners add themselves
    to lots of restaurants’ Notify lists for a certain night with the hope of scoring
    just one. The moment a host decides that a table is a no-show, or if there’s a
    cancellation, a push notification—“New Table Alert”—is sent to everyone on the
    Notify list for that night. The table goes to whoever claims it first on the app.
