    recently, specifically [the chapter on SIMD](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/simd/),
    and was impressed by auto-vectorization. The basic idea is that modern CPUs have
    so-called SIMD instructions that allow applying an operation to several values
    at once, which is much faster than performing the equivalent scalar instructions
    one at a time. Modern compilers can detect certain programming patterns where
    an operation is performed repeatedly on scalar values and group the operations
    to make use of the faster instructions.

    pattern would work in Rust as well, without having to manually annotate anything.
    So I opened up the [compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/) and typed in my first
    test, which looked like this:'

    them. But instead of SIMD instructions I got this assembly:'

    optimization from happening we can pass an argument into the function, so that
    the compiler cannot know the final result:'

    -march=skylake`, and sure enough, I got back 106 lines of assembly (omitted for
    brevity), including the desired SIMD instructions. I then switched to Clang, the
    LLVM-based C/C++ compiler that is also used by Rust, and it produced the exact
    same assembly as it did for the Rust version. This tells us the difference is
    not one of languages, but one of compilers.

- en: A quick comparative benchmark revealed the LLVM version to be significantly
    faster than GCC's vectorized loop, especially for large values of `n`, which is
    unsurprising when looking at the instructions, about 10 scalar instructions will
    beat hundreds of loops over vector instructions.

- en: LLVM apparently detects that that is exactly what we are trying to do, and as
    a result it can do away with the looping altogether and directly calculate the
    result in one step, changing `sum` from O(n) to O(1). Colour me impressed.

    deduce a more efficient way of calculating their sum than to actually add them
    all up.

- en: My takeaway here is that LLVM is even better at generating optimal code than
    I would have expected, at least for trivial examples. I am happy that I can continue
    writing idiomatic code without feeling like I am trading off performance for readability.
