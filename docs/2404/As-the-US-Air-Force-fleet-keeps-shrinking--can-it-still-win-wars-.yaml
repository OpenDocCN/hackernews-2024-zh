    tactics of sending wave after wave of first- and second-generation bombers against
    a target, raining down scores of munitions with the hope that one will hit the
    mark. Instead, a single B-2 Spirit — or even in years to come, an in-the-works
    B-21 Raider, touted by manufacturer Northrop Grumman as the first sixth-generation
    aircraft — can travel long distances and destroy a target that previously would
    have required multiple fighters and bombers working in concert.

    has less money to buy the new replacement planes it sorely needs.
