- en: In late February 2024, after receiving a few support requests, the OWASP Foundation
    became aware of a misconfiguration of OWASP’s old Wiki web server, leading to
    a data leak involving decade+-old member resumes.

    provided your resume as part of joining OWASP, we advise assuming your resume
    was part of this leak.'

    numbers, physical addresses, and other personally identifiable information.'

    membership process, whereby members were required in the 2006 to 2014 era to show
    a connection to the OWASP community. OWASP no longer collects resumes as part
    of the membership process.'

    browsing, reviewed the web server and Media Wiki configuration for other security
    issues, removed the resumes from the wiki site altogether, and purged the CloudFlare
    cache to prevent further access. Lastly, we have requested that the information
    be removed from the Web Archive.'

    attention with abundant caution. As many of the individuals affected by this leak
    are no longer with OWASP and the age of the data is between ten and 18 years old,
    a great deal of the personal details included in this leak are significantly out
    of date, making contact difficult. Regardless, we will contact the email addresses
    discovered during our investigations.'

- en: '**How does OWASP protect current membership data?** We apply modern cloud-based
    security best practices such as two-factor authentication, minimal access, and
    resiliency to protect our membership data. We also purposefully collect only minimal
    information for OWASP membership to minimize any potential data loss in the future.'

    your information from the Internet, so no immediate action on your part is required.
    Nothing needs to be done if the information at risk is outdated. However, if the
    information is current, such as containing your mobile phone number, please take
    the usual precautions when answering unsolicited emails, mail, or phone calls.'

    Foundation’s emphasis on cybersecurity. We apologize to those affected by the
    leak and are committed to ensuring that this does not happen again. We are reviewing
    our data retention policies and will be implementing additional security measures
    to prevent future leakes.

- en: 'Revision (19 April 2024): The incident should have been labeled a “leak” rather
    than a “breach”. The information was exposed to the public internet due to a misconfiguration,
    not because of an attack. We do not know if the exposed information was accessed,
    or by whom. The press release has been revised to clarify this.'

  zh: 修订（2024年4月19日）：这起事件本应被标记为“泄露”，而不是“违规”。由于配置错误，信息暴露在公共互联网上，而非攻击所致。我们不知道是否有人访问了暴露的信息，或者是谁访问了。新闻稿已经修订以澄清这一点。
