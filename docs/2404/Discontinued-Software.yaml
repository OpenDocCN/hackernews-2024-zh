- en: I've used computers for over 50 years so I've seen my share of computer programs,
    and computers, come and go. But it's always disconcerting when long used programs
    go away. Of course data stored in proprietary formats is the riskiest problem.
    But the effect on one's workflow is also an issue. I think that now that I am
    retired, and older, it's becoming particularly irritating. So here are some issues
    I've had and am having, personally.

    MSDOS and Windows with a stint using OS/2 and now for the past 15 years the Apple
    Mac. Each of those changes has generally meant a complete change of application
    software and, more often than not, new file formats. I'm concerned about changing
    again. Now that Apple is going to ARM processors, that is another change which
    would be difficult because of my reliance on discontinued/abandoned software that
    only runs on Intel Macs. And, of course, this software could still fail with future
    OS versions. The successors to macOS Mojave, in 2019, no longer support 32-bit
    applications, and this is a problem.

- en: I started writing programs in Java in the late 1990s. I used IBM's Visual Age
    for Java, which was the most advanced IDE at the time and in many respects the
    most advanced IDE ever. I can still run it on a Windows 2000 virtual machine,
    but it is locked in to an old Java version. IBM abandoned the product (which was
    actually written in Smalltalk) for Eclipse, which I've never liked. I was making
    major use of Java Beans which was well supported in Visual Age, but also supported
    in Borland JBuilder, so I switched to Borland. But then Borland also switched
    to Eclipse. So now I use NetBeans, which contrary to the name has minimal Java
    Bean support. Now the cost of the software went from about $100/year to free,
    but the quality and power is much reduced, so I'm not a happy camper. Luckily
    Netbeans is cross platform (I've used it under Windows, macOS, and Linux) and
    still being developed and supported so I don't feel that I will be orphaned again.
    However ownership has moved from Oracle to Apache which did delay their release
    schedule.

  zh: 我在上个世纪90年代末开始编写Java程序。我使用了当时最先进的IDE——IBM的Visual Age for Java，它在许多方面都是最先进的IDE。我仍然可以在Windows
    2000虚拟机上运行它，但它锁定在一个旧版Java上。IBM放弃了这个产品（实际上是用Smalltalk编写的），转而使用Eclipse，但我从未喜欢过Eclipse。我当时大量使用Java
    Beans，在Visual Age中得到了很好的支持，但在Borland JBuilder中也有支持，所以我转向了Borland。但后来Borland也转向了Eclipse。现在我使用NetBeans，尽管名字中有Beans，但对Java
    Bean的支持很少。现在软件的费用从每年约100美元降到了免费，但质量和功能大幅下降，所以我不是一个快乐的使用者。幸运的是，NetBeans跨平台（我在Windows、macOS和Linux下都使用过），仍在开发和支持中，所以我不觉得自己会再次孤立。但是所有权已从Oracle转移到了Apache，这确实延迟了他们的发布计划。

    I used ACDSee and Photoshop Elements. I kept my image files in a folder hierarchy.
    When I went to the Mac I bought Photoshop and used Bridge for management, still
    keeping the image files in a folder hierarchy. I can still use the purchased,
    not subscription, copy of Photoshop, but it will not run beyond macOS Sierra and
    doesn't handle the raw images from my Nikon D810.

    Sierra之外运行，并且无法处理来自我的尼康D810的原始图像。
- en: Then I got hooked on Aperture, now abandoned. I'm not happy about Aperture being
    dropped as Photos is not a substitute and I don't care for Lightroom. I also use
    the Nik plug-ins which have become free and then sold to DxO, and are commercial
    again. While Aperture continues to work in macOS Sierra, that version will be
    the end of the line for Nik plugins as they are 32-bit and the latest DxO 64-bit
    versions do no support Aperture. This leaves me in a waiting game, with only a
    year of software viability left. I save the processed images as large JPEGs, larger
    than I would otherwise need, so that I hopefully will never have to reprocess
    images with another program. I do keep all the raw initial images just in case.
    Luckily even those from my first DSLR, a Nikon D70, are still readable.

    Sierra中仍然可以运行，但那个版本将是Nik插件的终结，因为它们是32位的，而最新的DxO 64位版本不支持Aperture。这让我处于一个等待的状态，软件可用性仅剩一年。我保存处理过的图像为大型JPEG文件，比我实际需要的要大，希望以后不必再用其他程序重新处理图像。我确实保留了所有原始的RAW图像，以防万一。幸运的是，即使是来自我的第一台数码单反相机尼康D70的图像，现在仍然可以读取。

    is still viable! But with the move to personal computers I used a sad sequence
    of now dead word processors -- Superscripsit (TRS-80), Wordstar (CP/M) which is
    actually fairly recoverable, PC-Write also fairly recoverable, some really nice
    word processor for OS/2 which isn't recoverable, and many years of WordPerfect

    don't like Microsoft Word after many bad experiences in the 90's. So I embraced
    Pages. This has been precarious since the latest versions were de-featured to
    match the iOS version. Until recently the latest Pages wouldn't even open the
    earliest Pages documents. I still use Pages but have added Nisus Writer Pro. The
    advantage of Nisus Writer Pro is that its native save format is RTF which will
    open in just about everything (but Pages!). Nisus Writer Pro is also fully OS
    X featured while LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org/Microsoft Word are not. But few people
    talk about Nisus Writer these days so what is its future?

    Writer Pro。Nisus Writer Pro的优点在于其本地保存格式为RTF，几乎可以在所有软件中打开（但不包括Pages！）。Nisus Writer
    Pro还完全支持OS X功能，而LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org/Microsoft Word则不是。但是如今很少有人谈论Nisus Writer，那么它的未来会怎样呢？

    far the failures seem to have come from large companies' products (except for
    Circus Ponies). Obviously programs which have proprietary data formats, such as
    Scrivener, pose the greatest risk. I've used the Epsilon programmers editor since
    the late 1980's and it's a 1 man operation. Sounds risky but since it only edits
    ASCII text files I don't really have to worry although I'd sure miss its absence.
