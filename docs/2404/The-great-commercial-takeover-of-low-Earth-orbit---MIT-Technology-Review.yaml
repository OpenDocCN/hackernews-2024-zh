    is a change in the structure and function of the eye, something researchers identified
    about 10 years ago. “We didn’t really see it with the shuttle, but as we started
    doing more and more station missions, we saw it,” Platts says. They have also
    identified small, structural changes in the brain but have yet to figure out what
    that means in the long term: “That’s a relatively new risk that we didn’t know
    about before the space station.”'

    space is “amazing.” His group is working on about 30 risks to humans posed by
    space exploration, which it classifies in a color-coding scheme. Green issues
    are well controlled. Yellow risks are of moderate concern, and red ones must be
    solved before missions are possible. “Right now, for low Earth orbit there are
    no red. Everything is yellow and green. We understand it pretty well and we can
    deal with it. But as we get to lunar, we see more yellow and some red, and as
    we get to Mars, we see more red yet,” Platts says. “There are things that we know
    right now are a problem, and we’re working hard to try and figure them out, either
    from a research standpoint or an engineering standpoint.”

    effects of Mars dust on the human body, for example. Others, such as the unanticipated
    development of psychiatric disorders, can be studied closer to home.

    need to continue such research long beyond the space station’s retirement—one
    reason why it is imperative that someone else launch a successor space station,
    and soon. To that end, just as it did with SpaceX from 2006 through 2011, the
    agency has seeded several companies with small investments, promising to lease
    space on emergent space stations. And right now, the soonest likely to launch
    is being led out of a sprawling former Fry’s Electronics retail store in a shopping
    center complex in Texas.

- en: I met Michael Baine, the chief technology officer of Axiom Space, on a gray,
    drizzly January morning at the entrance to its Space Station Development Facility
    in Houston. Baine began his career at NASA Johnson Space Center just down the
    road, where he worked on everything from the shuttle and station to experimental
    lunar landers. Later, he left the agency to join Intuitive Machines as its chief
    of engineering. In February, that company’s Nova-C spacecraft, Odysseus, became
    the first US spacecraft to land successfully on the moon since the end of the
    Apollo program in 1972, making Intuitive Machines the first private company to
    land successfully on a celestial object beyond Earth. Baine has worked at Axiom
    Space since 2016\. The startup’s long-term goal is to build the first private
    commercial space station. It has successfully organized and managed three private
    missions to the International Space Station, in large part to study firsthand
    how humans work and live in space, so that they might design a more user-friendly
    product.

    Most notably, Blue Origin announced in 2021 that in partnership with the aerospace
    outfit Sierra Nevada, it would build Orbital Reef, a “mixed-use business park”
    capable of supporting up to 10 people simultaneously in low Earth orbit. In January,
    Sierra Nevada successfully stress-tested a one-third-scale test article of its
    habitat module, with the intention of launching a station into orbit on a Blue
    Origin New Glenn rocket in 2027\. Other companies, such as Lockheed Martin, have
    made moves into the market, though their progress is less clear.
