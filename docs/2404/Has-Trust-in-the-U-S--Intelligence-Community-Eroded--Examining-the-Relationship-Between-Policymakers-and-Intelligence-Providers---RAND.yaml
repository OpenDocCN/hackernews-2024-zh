- en: Over the past several years, media reports and articles by policy and U.S. Intelligence
    Community (IC) professionals have suggested that the IC is held in increasingly
    lower regard by some decisionmakers—and also by some in the general public—and
    that predictions made by IC professionals have had variable success in influencing
    decisionmakers. The authors of this report explored whether and to what degree
    trust in intelligence predictions and national estimates has degraded over time
    and what internal and external factors might be drivers of any perceived or real
    changes in the relationship between policymakers and the IC.

    on the presidential administration in power. Also, policymakers most frequently
    introduce bias in intelligence assessments from a desire to minimize the appearance
    of dissent, while the IC tends to introduce bias through self-censorship. The
    research team observed tensions in the relationship between IC professionals and
    policymakers: The IC has an incentive to elicit positive feedback from policymakers,
    and there are limited benefits (with regard to both the careers of intelligence
    professionals and their agencies'' budgets) in receiving negative feedback from
    policymakers. These tensions could create friction between (1) providing objective
    information and analysis to policymakers and (2) serving policymakers as customers
    of intelligence.'

    bias. The President selects and commands those who seek to introduce external
    bias. However, it is equally important to note that when the IC self-censors,
    it is doing so because of how the President governs.

    to reduce the appearance of dissent. Administration officials do not want to have
    to explain to the President, the Congress, or the American people why a part of
    the executive branch disagrees with a chosen policy.

    This self-censorship was largely driven by a desire to stay relevant or an effort

    bias and what does not. Although the IC conducts training on the types of bias
    that can affect analyses, IC analytic standards discuss bias in only the most
    general way.

    manage the intelligence agencies of the United States.
