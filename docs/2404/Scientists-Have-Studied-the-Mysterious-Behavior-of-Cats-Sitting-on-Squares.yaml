    laundry baskets, bins. And as many viral videos have shown, cats will even sit
    on flat square-shaped objects, to the internet''s collective puzzlement. Now,
    new research has taken the first dive into examining the phenomenon.'

- en: 'Researchers from City University of New York (CUNY) and the School of Psychology
    and Public Health in Australia set out to study cat cognition, and specifically
    whether they could perceive square-shaped optical illusions. They found that the
    box doesn’t need to be 3D to attract a cat: they’ll cozy up in a taped square
    or an optical illusion of a square, too. The study, called "If I fits I sits:
    A citizen science investigation into illusory contour susceptibility in domestic
    cats," was [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159121001258?dgcid=coauthor)
    on April 30 in *Applied Animal Behaviour Science,* an Elsevier journal.'

    science investigation. A big reason that they used citizen science is that COVID-19
    hit right when the research was set to start, according to Gabriella Smith, lead
    author on the study.

    at home to do it,” Smith said. “Homes are more comfortable for cats.”

    distinct shapes: a taped square, a Kanizsa illusion, and a control. A Kanizsa
    illusion is four “Pac-Man” shapes arranged so that the negative space forms a
    square. The control used the same Pac-Man shapes, but arranged face-out so that
    there was no illusion of a square.'

    the control. According to the study, that means that cats are capable of “illusory-contour
    perception.” Illusory contours are visual cues that suggest the edge of a shape
    that doesn’t really exist. In this case, the Kanizsa illusion uses shapes to mark
    the corners of a square, and the brain fills in the rest of the shape. Humans
    develop illusory contour perception around 3 to 4 months, and it strengthens with
    age.

    probably to do with navigating the environment. You need to know when not to walk
    into a tree or off a cliff.”

    is the first study that domestic cats are susceptible to illusory contours in
    an “ecologically relevant paradigm.” That is, a home, not a lab.

    cat cognition, and the first formal examination into cats attraction to 2D rather
    than 3D enclosures.

- en: One struggle with using citizen science to track cat behavior is that many participants
    failed to complete the study. As intended, the study lasted for six days, with
    each day including a 5-minute trial. The cat-owning citizen scientists placed
    the cat in another room and laid out the visual stimuli, measuring precisely to
    ensure consistency. Then, they put dark sunglasses on (so as not to visually cue
    the cats) and let them back into the room.

    sample size considerably. Within that sample size, the cats showed clear preference
    for the box-like illusions over the controls. Still, to further cat cognition
    research, the paper recommends future studies only require owners to perform the
    experiment for one day (rather than six) to increase likelihood of completion.

    cats like big, wild cats.

    may not encounter corners and walls the same way,” Smith said.
