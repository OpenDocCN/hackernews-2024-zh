- en: What’s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your
    devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room
    in the house to the “sun box”, and then run one cable from the box to the panels,
    and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from
    the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.

- en: Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It’ll only ever draw from
    the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your
    fridge won’t go off overnight for example).

- en: Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your
    wall, as far as the utility is concerned.
