    were offered a new cinematic experience. The revered director [David Lynch](https://www.wallpaper.com/tag/david-lynch)
    — known for cult films like Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire and Wild at Heart
    — has designed an exhibition entitled 'Interiors by David Lynch. A Thinking Room'
    on the grounds of the Rho Fiera. The exhibition marks a new kind of venture for
    the Oscar-winning auteur, but according to it curator, Antonio Monda, the New
    York University film professor and former artistic director of the Rome Film Festival,
    it’s not totally out of the blue.

    Rome Film Festival, and when I visited him in Los Angeles I found him polishing
    a desk. I asked him, what are you doing? And he told me he designs furniture now,''
    recounts Monda. ''So when the Salone del Mobile invited me to commission a filmmaker
    for this special event, I knew he was the real deal.'''

- en: Lynch’s casual carpentry hobby led him to design a full-scale installation at
    the fair. Inside each of the two 'Thinking Rooms,' a single armchair is surrounded
    by thick curtains made of blue velvet — a nod to Lynch’s 1986 film Blue Velvet.
    'At the beginning, there was only one big armchair inside the room. And I realised
    it was exactly like an image from one of his films,' says Monda of the scenography.

    While around the perimeter, screens playing abstract videos act like portals to
    the outside world. According to Monda, Lynch posits the installation as a moment
    of respite and reflection from the frenetic pace outside on the Fiera floor. To
    construct the sets, Monda and Lynch worked with the set builders at Milan’s Piccolo
    Teatro.

    Monda reflects on the project. ''Because you see how the mind of an artist works
    with a different form of expression. You’re accustomed to seeing how Lynch works
    when he does a film like Blue Velvet or a show like Twin Peaks, but now his creativity,
    his talent and his vision are channelled into furniture.'' However, Lynch was
    adamant that his new foray into design exists separately from his film career.
    ''He wants to keep it separated,'' relays Monday. ''He has said that this has
    nothing to do with his films.'''
