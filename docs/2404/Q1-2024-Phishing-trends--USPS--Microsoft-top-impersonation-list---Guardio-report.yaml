    impersonated in 11.6% of all [phishing](https://guard.io/dictionary/phishing "Guardio
    Dictionary - What's phishing?") attempts, marking a significant pivot towards
    brands associated with daily communications and online transactions. The USPS
    brand's leap from 12th to first in brand misuse within just two quarters underscores
    a distressing rise in its exploitation by scammers to deceive individuals. Microsoft,
    Meta (formerly Facebook), and Steam were among the top impersonated brands, indicating
    a continued threat to users across technology, gaming, and social media sectors.

    the telecommunications giant AT&T were among the top brands phishers attempted
