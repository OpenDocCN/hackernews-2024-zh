- en: From [the very first day that stripe.com existed on the internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20111213031731/https://stripe.com/),
    SDKs were a big part of the pitch to developers. Today, well over 90% of Stripe
    developers make well over 90% of requests to the Stripe API through the SDKs.
    As the front door to the API, the SDKs are how developers think about Stripe—to
    most people, it’s `stripe.charges.create()`, not `POST /v1/charges`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally, I hadn’t appreciated this until I joined Stripe in 2017—but by then,
    the growing scope of the Stripe API had exceeded our capacity to build SDKs by
    hand sustainably. Making manual changes across 7 different programming languages
    whenever we shipped a new endpoint was toilsome and error-prone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only that, TypeScript had eaten the world. Now, developers expect typeahead
    and documentation-on-hover directly in their text editor. Building SDKs that support
    comprehensive static types in a variety of languages was totally unthinkable without
    code generation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The team had spent over a year exploring existing open-source code generation
    tools before concluding that none could meet Stripe’s quality standards. Most
    codegen tools either work in only one language or just use string templating,
    which leaves you constantly fiddling with issues like trailing commas in Go and
    invalid indentation in Python. We needed to build our own codegen tool that enabled
    us to “learn once, write everywhere” and easily produce clean, correct code across
    all our languages.

    of prettier to enable product developers to quickly template quality code that
    came well-formatted out of the box. Over the next several months, dozens of engineers
    helped convert the SDKs to codegen, matching our carefully handcrafted code byte
    for byte.

    valuable SDKs are and how hard it is to codegen decent ones with the openapi-generator.

    versions, how to design RESTful pagination, how to set up API Keys, and a million
    other problems my old team had already solved at Stripe.
