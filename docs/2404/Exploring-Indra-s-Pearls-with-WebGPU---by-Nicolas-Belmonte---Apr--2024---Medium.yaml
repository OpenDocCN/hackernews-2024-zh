- en: Instead of carefully selecting circles and Mobius transformations mapping the
    outside of one into the inside of another, we can generalize the work by directly
    computing limit sets from the Mobius generators themselves. This yields limit
    sets that are not necessarily built from circles.

    sets is known as the Maskit parametrization. A Maskit slice is the area under
    which the groups become non discrete (and we render nonsense).

    non-discreetness. The visualization allows to explore these cusped groups. The
    book goes into detail on the properties of these groups.

- en: The initial visualizations are created via a `KleinGroup` class. The class renders
    each iteration into a texture that is fed back into the class for an ulterior
    iteration. Programmatically, this mimics well the action of the Mobius transformations.
    The resulting texture is fed into a `Quad` class which renders the quad to the
    screen.

- en: We then include an `RSphere` class which will render the Riemann Sphere. `KleinGroup`
    feeds the texture both to `Quad` and `RSphere`. The `quad` is then moved around
    with the sphere placed on top to describe how conjugations work.

    sets of Kleinian groups with the Maskit parametrisation*](https://www.josleys.com/articles/Kleinian%20escape-time_3.pdf).
    The algorithm renders a limit set via a fragment shader directly. The inputs to
    the fragment shader are the Mobius transformations and a texture that describes
    well the division across each side of the set. For each point in the screen if
    it falls in the area under or over the curve, we apply the Mobius transformation
    `a`or its inverse `A`.'

    We need to find the combination of Mobius products for which the group is parabolic
    (we call this the parabolic “word”). For each two Mobius transformations and their
    inverses, `a`, `A`, `b`, `B`, the word for it to be parabolic could be something
    like: `aaaaBaaaaB`. Finding the fixed point for this matrix product gives us a
    point that is tangent to two circles in the set.'

    points that will be tangent to each circle in the set. My implementation to get
    the word and its cyclic permutations can be found in [this notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/cde177e22e1a9a6e#getWord).

    [parabolic generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation#Fixed_points)
    (where the `Trace=2`). We walk the x-axis by obtaining a [Farey sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence)
    of fractions, for each of them we generate a Trace polygon, and we solve for it
    using Newton’s method, which will find the µ-value we need. Then the cusped limit
    set is fed the numerator of the Farey sequence `p`, its denominator `q`, and the
    complex value µ.
