    users’ privacy, enable interoperability and convenient single sign-ons, protect
    against identity theft and allow self-sovereign ownership of data.

    of name, age or address, referred to as “Verifiable credentials”). In this system,
    users are required to upload a video with their passport or national ID card.
    After this, their name, age or address is marked as verified. Then platforms can
    query this API and ask is_over_18, full_name or country_of_residence, but have
    no access to the user’s ID scan or any additional information (e.g. is_over_18
    only returns true or false, and doesn’t disclose the user’s name, home address
    or photo).

    of requiring government ID to verify a user’s name, age or location, they use
    social media, a web-of-trust or biometrics. This removes the ability for state
    censorship, and instead allows your friends to vouch for you, or allows you to
    gain access to services via fingerprints or an iris scan.

    databases, but rather the people you know, it is truly decentralized and accessible.

    you can signup with a fingerprint or iris scan — no passport or national ID card
    required. As it is not dependent on state-issued documents, biometrics would be
    accessible for stateless people, undocumented people and people who weren’t registered
    at birth, who are often unfairly excluded from the mainstream economy. However,
    biometrics are dangerous for many reasons, including security (someone could force
    you against your will to give your fingerprint or decode your iris pattern from
    a photo), personal safety (e.g. escaping from domestic abuse or protesting against
    an authoritarian government), as well as privacy (such as the natural compartmentalization
    of work and home life and online personas).
