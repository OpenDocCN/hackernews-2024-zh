- en: This brief report is a pilot study examining whether demographic variables (age
    and sex) and self-report responses on a dark tetrad scale predict the variance
    in how people respond to an aggregate of three items specifically created for
    this study and designed to assess a desire to have a loud vehicle. Participants
    were asked how they feel about their car, their desire to have a loud car, and
    their willingness to modify their muffler to have an even louder car. As muffler/exhaust
    system modifications are typically illegal, the present analyses add to both the
    understanding of the dark personality variables as well as what individual difference
    variables may predict who engages in these behaviours.

  zh: 这份简报是一项试点研究，旨在探讨人口统计变量（年龄和性别）和对黑暗四马林尺度的自我报告反应是否能预测人们对专门为本研究创建的三个项目的聚合的回应的差异，并设计用于评估渴望拥有一辆喧闹车辆的愿望。参与者被问及他们对自己的车的感觉，他们渴望拥有一辆喧闹车辆的愿望，以及他们愿意修改消声器以拥有一辆更吵的车的意愿。由于消声器/排气系统的改装通常是非法的，因此目前的分析既增加了对黑暗人格变量的理解，同时也预测了哪些个体差异变量可能会预测谁会参与这些行为。
- en: The dark tetrad includes the dimensions of Machiavellianism, or “controlled
    manipulation” ([Paulhus et al., 2021](#), p. 210) and reflect those who tend to
    be strategic in their interactions with others. Narcissism, or self-love/confidence,
    reflects those who tend to seek attention to reinforce their exaggerated positive
    self-views. Psychopathy, or impulsive cruelty to others, reflects the callous
    nature of some individuals. Sadism, defined in the dark tetrad as everyday sadism,
    involves the enjoyment some individuals experience watching others being harmed
    or from inflicting pain and suffering on others ([Paulhus et al., 2021](#)). Although
    the dark personality dimensions share commonalities, with some suggesting that
    there may be a common dark factor ([Moshagen et al., 2018](#)), research has shown
    that the dimensions have unique correlations with some variables. For example,
    [Galić (2016)](#) reported that both Machiavellian and psychopathy scores positively
    correlated with counterproductive work attitudes, such as time theft, but that
    the positive correlation with narcissism did not reach significance (sadism was
    not measured). [Campbell et al. (2009)](#) reported that a significant negative
    correlation was found between psychoticism scores and higher-order moral reasoning
    with a focus on basic rights for people, but that neither Machiavellian nor narcissism
    scores correlated significantly greater than zero (sadism was not measured).

  zh: 黑四象包括马基雅维里主义的维度，或“控制操纵”（[Paulhus et al., 2021](#)，第210页），反映了那些在与他人互动时倾向于策略性行为的人。自恋，或自我爱/自信，反映了那些倾向于寻求注意以强化其夸大的积极自我观的人。精神病态，或对他人的冲动残忍，反映了一些个体的冷酷本性。在黑四象中定义的虐待狂，涉及到一些个体从观看他人受害或者对他人造成痛苦和苦难中体验到的愉悦（[Paulhus
    et al., 2021](#)）。尽管黑暗人格维度具有共同点，一些研究表明可能存在一个共同的黑暗因素（[Moshagen et al., 2018](#)），但研究表明这些维度与某些变量具有独特的相关性。例如，[Galić（2016）](#)报告称，马基雅维里主义和精神病态评分与消极工作态度（如时间浪费）呈正相关，但自恋的正相关并未达到显著水平（未测量虐待狂）。[Campbell
    et al.（2009）](#)报告称，精神病质评分与更高层次的道德推理之间存在显著负相关，重点是人们的基本权利，但马基雅维里主义和自恋评分与零的相关性并未显著大于零（未测量虐待狂）。
- en: As each of the dark tetrad traits have been reported to be correlated with antisocial
    intent and criminal attitudes ([Mededović & Kovačević, 2021](#)), the present
    study predicted that each dark trait would positively correlate with the loud
    car scale aggregate, and because typically modifications to vehicles represent
    criminal activity, it was predicted that sadism and psychopathy would positively
    predict the aggregate of the car items. In addition, it was predicted that narcissism
    would positively predict the car scale because making their car louder directs
    attention from others to that car and, by extension, the driver. This “look at
    me” behaviour is reflective of narcissism ([DeWall et al., 2011](#)). Machiavellianism
    was not predicted to be a strong predictor of the aggregate of the car items,
    as although Machiavellianism correlates with antisocial measures, the review by
    [Kowalski et al. (2021)](#) suggests that once psychopathy has been entered into
    regression equations, variance due to Machiavellianism tends to become nonsignificant
    when predicting antisocial behaviours. With respect to demographic variables,
    it is predicted that younger individuals who are men will score the highest on
    the aggregate of the three car items as [Feder et al. (2019)](#) report that this
    segment of the population (i.e., young men) has the highest prevalence of loud
    leisure noise.

  zh: 鉴于每种黑暗四重特质据报道与反社会意图和犯罪态度相关（[Mededović & Kovačević, 2021](#)），本研究预测每种黑暗特质与高音车辆量表总数呈正相关。由于通常车辆的改装代表着犯罪活动，因此预测虐待狂和精神病态将正向预测车辆项目的总和。此外，预测自恋将正向预测车辆量表，因为让他们的车辆更响引起他人对车辆及其驾驶员的注意。这种“看我”的行为反映了自恋（[DeWall等人，2011](#)）。根据[Kowalski等人（2021）](#)的回顾，马基雅维利主义预测不会成为车辆项目总和的强预测因子，因为尽管马基雅维利主义与反社会测量相关，但当心理病态被输入回归方程时，由于马基雅维利主义预测的差异

    correlate with an aggregate of three car-related items, including how the individual
    related to their vehicle, how they like loud cars, and that they would modify
    their muffler to make their car louder. The results demonstrated that each of
    the SD4 scales correlated positively with the car scale. In addition, it was predicted
    that younger men as well as the sadism, psychopathy, and narcissism scales would
    positively and significantly predict the car scores. The regression results somewhat
    supported the predictions. Although the regression weight for age was not significant,
    the direction was negative, suggesting greater endorsement for the car items for
    the younger sample. The regression weight for sex was significant, supporting
    the hypothesis that men would score higher on the car scale. Both psychopathy
    and sadism significantly predicted the car scale, and supported the hypotheses
    based on the links between these dark dimensions and criminal intentions and antisocial
    attitudes ([Mededović & Kovačević, 2021](#)). The present results did not support
    the hypothesis that narcissism would predict the car scores as although the regression
    weight was positive, the weight was nonsignificant. Possibly if the car scale
    had included questions about an audience, or specifically people noticing the
    car, narcissism may have been a stronger predictor. Alternatively, the lack of
    a significant predictor weight for narcissism could be because of the relationship
    between narcissism and empathy. If individuals who chose to operate loud cars
    do so even if the noise startles or upsets people, then it may be that those who
    have loud cars score lower on empathy. Examining the correlations between trait
    emotional intelligence and the dark triad, [Petrides et al. (2011)](#) reported
    that empathy had significant negative correlations with Machiavellian and psychopathy
    scores, but a nonsignificant correlation with narcissism scores. Future research
    may want to examine the possible predictive power of empathy with respect to operating
    loud cars.

  zh: 这份简报测试了暗四重性格量表与三个与汽车相关的项目（包括个体与其车辆的关系、喜欢大声车辆的程度以及修改消音器使车辆更响亮）的总体相关性预测。结果表明，每个SD4量表都与汽车量表呈正相关。此外，预测年轻男性以及刻薄、精神病和自恋量表将正向显著预测汽车分数。回归结果在某种程度上支持了这些预测。尽管年龄的回归权重并不显著，但方向是负向的，表明年轻样本对汽车项目的认同度更高。性别的回归权重显著，支持男性在汽车量表上得分较高的假设。刻薄和精神病都显著预测了汽车量表，并支持了这些暗性格维度与犯罪意图和反社会态度之间联系的假设（[Mededović
    & Kovačević, 2021](#)）。目前的结果并未支持自恋将预测汽车得分的假设，尽管回归权重为正，但权重并不显著。可能是如果汽车量表包括关于观众或特别是人们注意到汽车的问题，自恋可能会成为更强的预测因素。另外，自恋未能显著预测的可能原因之一是自恋与共情之间的关系。如果那些选择驾驶大声车辆的人们即使知道噪音会惊吓或让人不快，仍然会这么做，那么可能那些驾驶大声车辆的人得分较低的共情。在研究特质情感智力与暗三重性格之间的相关性时，[Petrides
    et al. (2011)](#) 报告称，共情与权谋主义和精神病得分显著负相关，而与自恋得分相关性不显著。未来的研究可能需要探讨共情在预测驾驶大声车辆方面的可能预测能力。
- en: The present findings are in agreement with those reported by [Wehner et al.
    (2022)](#) who reported that psychopathy and sadism scores had significant positive
    correlations with responses to a single item asking if the individual had intentionally
    started an illegal fire. In contrast, both Machiavellian and narcissism scores
    did not correlate significantly with the fire-setting question. As described by
    [Paulhus et al. (2021)](#), the distinction between sadism and psychopathy, as
    measured by the SD4, refers to the proximity of the individual with possible victims
    such that psychopathy reflects an up-close cruelty whereas sadism includes viewing
    the harm to others from a distance. In the context of loud cars, it can understandable
    how both sadism and psychopathy were both significant predictor variables. Modifying
    a muffler to make a car louder is disturbing to pedestrians, other drivers, and
    animals at a distance, meeting the sadism component, as well as startling when
    up close at intersections, meeting the psychopathy component. Recently, [Dinić
    et al. (2021)](#) reported that each of the dark tetrad dimensions positively
    correlated with utilitarian decision making in scenarios where an individual had
    to be sacrificed to save other people. Other than legally enforcing laws with
    respect to these automobile modifications, the present results suggest that other
    tactics, such as information campaigns, may not be useful as it is unlikely that
    those scoring higher on psychopathy and sadism would be swayed by the fact that
    the modified mufflers may be damaging to others, as researchers have recently
    reported that the dark personality dimensions are negatively correlated with altruism
    measures (see [Trahair et al., 2022](#)).

  zh: 现有研究结果与[Wehner等人（2022年）](#)报告的结果一致，后者指出精神病和虐待狂得分与一个单一项目的回答显著正相关，即个体是否有意引发非法火灾。相比之下，马基雅维利主义和自恋得分与引发火灾的问题没有显著相关性。如[Paulhus等人（2021年）](#)描述的那样，由SD4测量的虐待症和精神病的区别在于个体与可能受害者的接近程度，精神病反映出近距离的残酷，而虐待症则包括从远处观看他人的伤害。在喧哗的汽车背景下，可以理解为何虐待症和精神病都是显著的预测变量。修改消声器使汽车更响可能会干扰行人、其他司机和远处的动物，符合虐待症的组成部分，并且在交叉口近距离引起惊吓，符合精神病的组成部分。最近，[Dinić等人（2021年）](#)报告说，黑暗四马（Dark
    Tetrad）的每个维度都与实用主义决策在牺牲一个人以拯救他人的场景中呈正相关。除了在法律上强制执行有关这些汽车修改的法律外，现有结果表明其他策略，如信息宣传活动，可能不会有用，因为那些在精神病和虐待症得分较高的人不太可能因为修改后的消声器可能对他人造成损害而被说服，正如研究人员最近报告的那样，黑暗人格维度与利他主义措施呈负相关（见[Trahair等人，2022年](#)）。

- en: Although the present study explains some of the variance in people’s favourable
    attitudes towards cars with loud modified mufflers, the study is limited in that
    other loud vehicles were not examined. For example, different results may have
    occurred if motorcycles or trucks had been the target variable. Size of vehicle
    may also have had an impact on the results. For example, [Pazhoohi and Klingstone
    (2022)](#) reported that larger vehicles are perceived as more aggressive (see
    also [Yoshida & Igata, 2012](#)). If both larger and louder car items had been
    included, the correlations with sadism and psychopathy may have been even greater.
    Also it was not examined whether individuals choose to listen to loud music while
    driving, as some researchers, such as [Brodsky et al. (2018](#); see also [Karageorghis
    et al., 2021](#)), have reported that listening to hostile music while driving
    resulted in higher frequencies of violating speed limits in a driving simulator.
    In addition, the three items used to generate the car scale were created for the
    purpose of this pilot study and were not validated with respect to predicting
    actual ownership of load cars. Future research may want to examine other loud/modified
    vehicles, how drivers make their cars louder, actual loud car ownership, other
    antisocial behaviours (such as lighting fireworks in residential areas), socioeconomic
    factors, as well as other measures of dark personality characteristics and empathy
    in a more heterogeneous sample.

  zh: 虽然本研究解释了人们对装有响亮改装排气管汽车的积极态度的一些变异，但该研究的局限性在于未对其他响亮车辆进行检查。例如，如果摩托车或卡车是研究的目标变量，可能会得出不同的结果。车辆的大小也可能会影响结果。例如，[Pazhoohi
    和 Klingstone (2022)](#) 报告称，较大的车辆被视为更具攻击性（另见[Yoshida & Igata, 2012](#)）。如果同时包括了更大和更响的车辆项目，则与虐待狂和精神病的相关性可能会更大。另外，本研究未考察个体是否选择在驾驶时听响亮音乐，因为一些研究人员，如[Brodsky
    et al. (2018)](#)（另见[Karageorghis et al., 2021](#)），报告称在驾驶模拟器中听敌对音乐会导致超速违法的频率更高。此外，用于生成汽车量表的三个项目是为本次试点研究目的而创建的，并未经验证以预测实际拥有响车的情况。未来的研究可能需要检查其他响/改装车辆，驾驶员如何让他们的车辆更响，实际响车拥有情况，其他反社会行为（例如在住宅区燃放烟花），社会经济因素，以及更异质化样本中黑暗人格特征和移情能力的其他测量指标。
