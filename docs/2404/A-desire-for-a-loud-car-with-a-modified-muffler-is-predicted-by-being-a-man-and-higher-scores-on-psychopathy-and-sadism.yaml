- en: This brief report is a pilot study examining whether demographic variables (age
    and sex) and self-report responses on a dark tetrad scale predict the variance
    in how people respond to an aggregate of three items specifically created for
    this study and designed to assess a desire to have a loud vehicle. Participants
    were asked how they feel about their car, their desire to have a loud car, and
    their willingness to modify their muffler to have an even louder car. As muffler/exhaust
    system modifications are typically illegal, the present analyses add to both the
    understanding of the dark personality variables as well as what individual difference
    variables may predict who engages in these behaviours.

- en: The dark tetrad includes the dimensions of Machiavellianism, or “controlled
    manipulation” ([Paulhus et al., 2021](#), p. 210) and reflect those who tend to
    be strategic in their interactions with others. Narcissism, or self-love/confidence,
    reflects those who tend to seek attention to reinforce their exaggerated positive
    self-views. Psychopathy, or impulsive cruelty to others, reflects the callous
    nature of some individuals. Sadism, defined in the dark tetrad as everyday sadism,
    involves the enjoyment some individuals experience watching others being harmed
    or from inflicting pain and suffering on others ([Paulhus et al., 2021](#)). Although
    the dark personality dimensions share commonalities, with some suggesting that
    there may be a common dark factor ([Moshagen et al., 2018](#)), research has shown
    that the dimensions have unique correlations with some variables. For example,
    [Galić (2016)](#) reported that both Machiavellian and psychopathy scores positively
    correlated with counterproductive work attitudes, such as time theft, but that
    the positive correlation with narcissism did not reach significance (sadism was
    not measured). [Campbell et al. (2009)](#) reported that a significant negative
    correlation was found between psychoticism scores and higher-order moral reasoning
    with a focus on basic rights for people, but that neither Machiavellian nor narcissism
    scores correlated significantly greater than zero (sadism was not measured).

- en: As each of the dark tetrad traits have been reported to be correlated with antisocial
    intent and criminal attitudes ([Mededović & Kovačević, 2021](#)), the present
    study predicted that each dark trait would positively correlate with the loud
    car scale aggregate, and because typically modifications to vehicles represent
    criminal activity, it was predicted that sadism and psychopathy would positively
    predict the aggregate of the car items. In addition, it was predicted that narcissism
    would positively predict the car scale because making their car louder directs
    attention from others to that car and, by extension, the driver. This “look at
    me” behaviour is reflective of narcissism ([DeWall et al., 2011](#)). Machiavellianism
    was not predicted to be a strong predictor of the aggregate of the car items,
    as although Machiavellianism correlates with antisocial measures, the review by
    [Kowalski et al. (2021)](#) suggests that once psychopathy has been entered into
    regression equations, variance due to Machiavellianism tends to become nonsignificant
    when predicting antisocial behaviours. With respect to demographic variables,
    it is predicted that younger individuals who are men will score the highest on
    the aggregate of the three car items as [Feder et al. (2019)](#) report that this
    segment of the population (i.e., young men) has the highest prevalence of loud
    leisure noise.

    business students with a mean age of 18.14 years (*SD* = 1.19, range 16 to 37).
    Because the research question is new and exploratory, the minimum number of participants
    was considered to be 250, based on the results reported by [Schönbrodt and Perugini
    (2013)](#) for the sample size for correlations to be stable. Individuals completed
    the self-report measures on-line using the survey system Qualtrics. Participants
    were given partial credit towards the research component of their course, which
    only required checking the consent page and was not contingent on completion of
    the survey. The study received institutional ethical approval.

    affect towards vehicles, and specifically, loud cars with modified mufflers. The
    items were: “My car is an extension of what makes me a person”, “I think loud
    cars are really cool”, and “If I could, I would make my car louder with muffler
    modification”. Items were responded to using the following response key: 1 – *strongly
    disagree*, 2 – *somewhat disagree*, 3 – *neither agree nor disagree*, 4 – *somewhat
    agree*, or 5 – *strongly agree*. For the present sample, the mean was 6.53 (*SD*
    = 3.11). Although the mean was relatively low (the maximum score could be 15),
    10 of the participants had a scale aggregate score of 15, the scale total was
    not skewed (skew = .82, kurtosis = –.09), and the internal consistency (coefficient
    α) was .76\. A factor analysis of the three items demonstrated a single factor
    explaining 56% of the variance.'

    For the present data, Machiavellianism, titled “Crafty”, had a mean of 24.51 (*SD*

    α reliability estimate of .72\. Sadism, titled “Mean”, had a mean of 18.26 (*SD*
    = 5.47), and a coefficient α reliability estimate of .76\. The α estimates in
    the present study are slightly lower but similar to those reported by [Paulhus
    et al. (2021)](#), who reported estimates, across three samples, from .75 to .78

    significantly with each of the SD4 scales. At the car scale item level, each item
    had significant (*p* < .001, two-tailed) positive correlations with the SD4 scales
    except for the correlation between the item “If I could, I would make my car louder
    with muffler modification” and the Crafty scale, which correlated with a value

- en: This brief report tested the predictions that the dark tetrad scales would positively
    correlate with an aggregate of three car-related items, including how the individual
    related to their vehicle, how they like loud cars, and that they would modify
    their muffler to make their car louder. The results demonstrated that each of
    the SD4 scales correlated positively with the car scale. In addition, it was predicted
    that younger men as well as the sadism, psychopathy, and narcissism scales would
    positively and significantly predict the car scores. The regression results somewhat
    supported the predictions. Although the regression weight for age was not significant,
    the direction was negative, suggesting greater endorsement for the car items for
    the younger sample. The regression weight for sex was significant, supporting
    the hypothesis that men would score higher on the car scale. Both psychopathy
    and sadism significantly predicted the car scale, and supported the hypotheses
    based on the links between these dark dimensions and criminal intentions and antisocial
    attitudes ([Mededović & Kovačević, 2021](#)). The present results did not support
    the hypothesis that narcissism would predict the car scores as although the regression
    weight was positive, the weight was nonsignificant. Possibly if the car scale
    had included questions about an audience, or specifically people noticing the
    car, narcissism may have been a stronger predictor. Alternatively, the lack of
    a significant predictor weight for narcissism could be because of the relationship
    between narcissism and empathy. If individuals who chose to operate loud cars
    do so even if the noise startles or upsets people, then it may be that those who
    have loud cars score lower on empathy. Examining the correlations between trait
    emotional intelligence and the dark triad, [Petrides et al. (2011)](#) reported
    that empathy had significant negative correlations with Machiavellian and psychopathy
    scores, but a nonsignificant correlation with narcissism scores. Future research
    may want to examine the possible predictive power of empathy with respect to operating
    loud cars.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The present findings are in agreement with those reported by [Wehner et al.
    (2022)](#) who reported that psychopathy and sadism scores had significant positive
    correlations with responses to a single item asking if the individual had intentionally
    started an illegal fire. In contrast, both Machiavellian and narcissism scores
    did not correlate significantly with the fire-setting question. As described by
    [Paulhus et al. (2021)](#), the distinction between sadism and psychopathy, as
    measured by the SD4, refers to the proximity of the individual with possible victims
    such that psychopathy reflects an up-close cruelty whereas sadism includes viewing
    the harm to others from a distance. In the context of loud cars, it can understandable
    how both sadism and psychopathy were both significant predictor variables. Modifying
    a muffler to make a car louder is disturbing to pedestrians, other drivers, and
    animals at a distance, meeting the sadism component, as well as startling when
    up close at intersections, meeting the psychopathy component. Recently, [Dinić
    et al. (2021)](#) reported that each of the dark tetrad dimensions positively
    correlated with utilitarian decision making in scenarios where an individual had
    to be sacrificed to save other people. Other than legally enforcing laws with
    respect to these automobile modifications, the present results suggest that other
    tactics, such as information campaigns, may not be useful as it is unlikely that
    those scoring higher on psychopathy and sadism would be swayed by the fact that
    the modified mufflers may be damaging to others, as researchers have recently
    reported that the dark personality dimensions are negatively correlated with altruism
    measures (see [Trahair et al., 2022](#)).

- en: Although the present study explains some of the variance in people’s favourable
    attitudes towards cars with loud modified mufflers, the study is limited in that
    other loud vehicles were not examined. For example, different results may have
    occurred if motorcycles or trucks had been the target variable. Size of vehicle
    may also have had an impact on the results. For example, [Pazhoohi and Klingstone
    (2022)](#) reported that larger vehicles are perceived as more aggressive (see
    also [Yoshida & Igata, 2012](#)). If both larger and louder car items had been
    included, the correlations with sadism and psychopathy may have been even greater.
    Also it was not examined whether individuals choose to listen to loud music while
    driving, as some researchers, such as [Brodsky et al. (2018](#); see also [Karageorghis
    et al., 2021](#)), have reported that listening to hostile music while driving
    resulted in higher frequencies of violating speed limits in a driving simulator.
    In addition, the three items used to generate the car scale were created for the
    purpose of this pilot study and were not validated with respect to predicting
    actual ownership of load cars. Future research may want to examine other loud/modified
    vehicles, how drivers make their cars louder, actual loud car ownership, other
    antisocial behaviours (such as lighting fireworks in residential areas), socioeconomic
    factors, as well as other measures of dark personality characteristics and empathy
    in a more heterogeneous sample.
