- en: GQL, or Graph Query Language, is an ISO standard defined for property graph
    databases. It stands as the first sibling database language emerging from the
    ISO standard committee for databases since the initial publication of the SQL
    standard in 1986.

- en: Firstly, property graph databases utilize property graph data modeling, where
    vertices and edges serve as the fundamental units to represent data elements.
    In contrast, the traditional relational data model relies on tables for data representation.
    Intuitively, the property graph model offers greater flexibility and aligns more
    closely with real-world interactions between objects.
  id: totrans-split-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, there are various storage formats tailored to support the property
    graph data model. Native graph databases distinguish themselves from non-native
    counterparts primarily through their storage format. In a native graph database,
    vertices and edges are treated as first-class citizens within the storage layer,
    resulting in superior performance, particularly in path traversal and iterative
    graph algorithms. This performance boost stems from the native graph database’s
    inherent structure as a gigantic object index. During graph traversal, one navigates
    from an active vertex set to another via their connecting edges, circumventing
    the need for costly runtime joins (as relational databases do) to reconnect data
    elements. In my opinion, native graph database’s graph storage format is the key
    differentiator to other databases. TigerGraph falls in the category of native
    graph database.

    alongside relational databases and key-value store databases. In the past decade,
    the burgeoning graph database industry has witnessed a plethora of vendors offering
    their own graph database products, each accompanied by their proprietary graph
    query language. Examples include Neo4j’s Cypher, TigerGraph’s GSQL, Oracle’s PGQ,
    LDBC’s G-core, and Gremlin, among others. For a comprehensive overview of the
    graph query language landscape, I recommend referring to Peter Boncz’s insightful
    [survey slide](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/gql-survey.pdf) from CWI.

    hierarchy to host graph schemas and their catalog objects. This physical design
    of the catalog layout is to adapt to the flexibility of two-level property graph
    modeling, where a graph is a logical container and vertices and edges are the
    base containers. This design was initially informally discussed between TigerGraph
    and Neo4j, as we were first inspired by our multi-graph modeling product offering—multiple
    graphs can share a subset of the base vertex and edge containers. After multi-round
    constructive discussions, we agree that graph schemas will evolve freely under
    this catalog layout, especially for cross graph sharing and joining.

    the summer of 2015 in Mountain View, CA, drawing inspiration from both the SQL
    standard and pattern matching literature. Alin and I implemented the initial version
    of GSQL that summer, burning many night candles. Throughout this process, we’ve
    contributed our best practices and real-world experiences back to the ISO GQL
    standard. We’re continuing this journey with the ISO standard committee, actively
    shaping the future versions of GQL. Along the way, we’ve forged numerous friendships
    within the global graph community, collectively delivering this beautiful standard.
    We hope you’ll recognize the dedication and passion this community has poured
    into this endeavor and take the time to learn, appreciate the design, and, most
    importantly, start using it.
