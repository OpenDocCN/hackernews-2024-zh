- en: The 12 preceding volumes of Professor Khaldun’s study articulate his belief
    that science has been the driving force in human history for the past 50 millennia
    at least, an idea sometimes criticized as containing too broad a definition of
    science to be useful. His latest book, however, brings him into an era when the
    idea can be tested for its explanatory power.

- en: It’s also a period that illustrates Khaldun’s contention that science was always
    a politics by other means, a utopian and unselfaware revolution attempting to
    shift power from residual aristocracies to the general populace. What early scientists
    took to be neutral and necessary aspects of the scientific method, such as reproducibility,
    falsifiability, Occam’s razor, peer review, and so on (cf. Khaldun pp. 580-935),
    were actually political institutions all along, attempting to regulate human action
    with the ultimate goal of alleviating suffering. The invention of science as a
    method for understanding nature obscured for centuries the realization that it
    was also the optimum mode of social regulation. Only the population-overshoot
    crisis early in the millennium brought scientists to an awareness of this.

    itself in a race to invent a sustainable way of life before its reproductive success
    and primitive technology severely damaged the carrying capacity of the planet.
    Global warming and an anthropogenic major extinction event did occur, but it could
    have been worse: a full six billion of our ancestors existed simultaneously at
    the tip of an unsustainable technological prosthesis, and the social system facing
    this situation was the Late Feudal phase known as capitalism. Many technical advances
    of the era therefore did nothing to mitigate the ecological disaster or, worse,
    added to it. Even the great leaps in the biological sciences, reinforcing health
    and initiating the assault on senescence, only exacerbated matters, as humanity
    entered the age of longevity still enmeshed in a dysfunctional social system.'

- en: In describing this crux, Khaldun rehearses again his theory of history in which
    social systems consist of clashes between residual and emergent elements. He reads
    feudalism as a clash of traditional command economies with emergent capitalism;
    capitalism as a clash of feudalism with early permaculture; and our late permaculture
    as a clash between residual capitalism and some poorly modelled emergent harmony
    which for biological reasons may be approachable only asymptotically.

- en: In the overshoot crisis, Khaldun sees this struggle expressed as a conflict
    between science, representing the emergent permaculture, and capitalism, representing
    residual elements of feudalism.

- en: Capitalism attempted to maintain a hierarchy in which science would serve as
    pet monkey, cranking out new commodities and increasing lifespans. Science resisted
    this impulse not only because of the practical danger of the overshoot to the
    progeny of scientists, but also because science itself would be threatened if
    the residual elements succeeded. So scientists of the era, despite the lack of
    a paradigm describing them as historical actors, set to work transforming capitalism
    into a system of practices they recognized as more rational, universal, lawful
    and pragmatic — that is to say, more scientific.

    power of science in the political realm initiated the institutional mutation towards
    the system identified retroactively as permaculture, which now seems to us so
    natural. Adequate food, water, shelter, clothing, health care, and education for
    all; increased longevity; the stabilization of the Earth’s ecologies; the inhabitation
    of the Solar System: these and other major achievements of the millennium all
    followed from science’s successful transformation of the social system of that
    time.'

- en: Whether macrohistories such as Khaldun’s can still convince is doubtful. His
    “metameme narrative” of residual and emergent smacks of Hegelian teleology, in
    which progress happens no matter what people choose to do. A useful corrective
    to this kind of metaphysics is the recent “hyperannalist” work of the computer
    archaeologist AI 80004 “Ferdnand”. Excavations in the enormous mass of data remaining
    from the overshoot period enabled 80004 to list all scientists working at that
    time. Their careers are summarized, then analysed in a series of tables and graphs
    charting their profits and investments, their political actions, their child-rearing,
    the ecological utility of the scientific content of their careers, and so on (cf.
    pp. 7378-9417).

- en: Close perusal of these tables will indeed reveal which scientists contributed
    to the survival of the overshoot and invention of permaculture, and which did
    not. But one sees in the tables no teleology, no residual or emergent elements,
    no grand battle of metamemes — only small individual actions, spread across the
    whole range of possibility. Khaldun might claim that these actions “summed over
    history” reveal the beliefs motivating scientists, and thus the powerful existence
    of the metamemes. But this would be a subject for yet another volume, called perhaps
    *History Judges You*.
