- en: The excellent Arc browser that’s been impressing macOS and iOS users over the
    past couple of years is finally [making its way to Windows](https://arc.net/)
    today. Arc is designed to change the way you use a browser in many fundamental
    ways, with a collapsible sidebar that combines vertical tabs and bookmarks into
    an app switcher-like experience, a command bar for navigation, and useful tools
    to help you browse the web.

- en: The company behind Arc, aptly named The Browser Company, is betting on its browser
    being different enough to entice Windows users away from Chrome and Edge. “Arc
    really is just calming and keeps you organized,” says Hursh Agrawal, co-founder
    of The Browser Company, in an interview with *The Verge*. “It helps you handle
    your tasks during the day better.”

- en: As someone who is hooked on Chrome, it has been a jarring but rewarding experience
    to use Arc. Once you get used to the Arc way of doing things, the idea of a sidebar
    instead of a row of tabs or just the ability to remove all the browser clutter
    and focus on a single website feels like a refreshing approach to the way we use
    the web today. Arc is also built on top of Chromium, so websites just work and
    you can bring your extensions along for the ride.

- en: Arc for Windows is also a significant step in a far bigger vision for what The
    Browser Company calls “the operating system for the internet” — this idea that
    Arc is an entire platform for the open web that goes beyond just a browser. Arc
    for Windows is an important milestone for this vision, not least because The Browser
    Company has also helped bring Swift, the programming language created by Apple
    for building iOS and Mac apps, to Windows.

- en: Arc on Windows is built using Swift, and software engineers at The Browser Company
    have helped largely open source all of the fundamental infrastructure for building
    Windows applications with Swift. Saleem Abdulrasool, a member of the Swift core
    team and a software engineer at The Browser Company, has spent more than six years
    working on bringing Swift to Windows. “I am so excited about this,” says Abdulrasool
    in an interview with *The Verge*. “Finally seeing something come to fruition after
    so long is truly something. It’s really an effort of love.”

- en: The release of Arc on Windows, thanks to Swift, could encourage other developers
    to follow a similar path, especially in the wake of the White House urging software
    developers to use memory-safe programming languages like Swift instead of the
    C++ language that’s used to build Chrome and Edge. “We actually invite others
    to participate as well,” says Abdulrasool. “While we’re leading the charge we’re
    more than happy to have people come with us.”

- en: For all the impressive underpinnings of Arc, it still needs to be good enough
    to go up against Chrome, though. It’s literally marketed as “the Chrome replacement
    you’ve been waiting for” after all, so there’s a lot riding on this Windows release.
    The Browser Company will also have to contend with Microsoft’s [aggressive attempts](/23935029/microsoft-edge-forced-windows-10-google-chrome-fight)
    to switch Windows users to Edge as well as dethroning Chrome, a challenge unlike
    those any browser entrant has faced over the past decades of competition.

    that disrupt the status quo. Fisher [joined The Browser Company](/2022/10/31/23428862/arc-browser-web-company-darin-fisher)
    in late 2022\. His career started at Netscape in the early 2000s before he helped
    turn Navigator into Firefox and then spent 16 years building Chrome and ChromeOS.

- en: Fisher argues that there’s a gap in the marketplace for Arc and that rival browsers
    have become stagnant. “I saw the transition at Google when people went from everybody
    using Internet Explorer and Firefox to suddenly people using Chrome,” says Fisher
    in an interview with *The Verge*. Internet Explorer had gotten stagnant and Chrome
    struck at the perfect time with a better product. That’s what The Browser Company
    is hoping to replicate.

- en: It’s also trying to do that with new tools. “How do you deal with this complexity
    of our lives? We need tools that help us meet where we are, that’s what Arc is
    all about,” says Darin. In the macOS version, you can customize webpages to change
    their color palette, play around with [new AI features](/2024/2/1/24058013/arc-browser-smart-folders-browse-for-me-ai),
    or create shareable websites. Not all of these beloved features are making their
    way to the Windows release just yet, but the fundamentals, like the sidebar, Spaces,
    profiles, split view, and picture-in-picture, are all available to Windows users
    today.

    as the Windows release grows in terms of features to reach parity with the macOS
    version. “I think it’s scary for some people, but it improves every week,” says
    Agrawal. “People say it’s like receiving Christmas gifts every Thursday.”

- en: The goal is to build up the Windows release and remove some of the Mac features
    that aren’t widely used until they’re at parity as one single app. “The experience
    [of Arc on Windows] is good, but it’s not there yet and we’re going to ship every
    week to get it to a place where it’s unbelievable,” admits Agrawal.

    Company has used Microsoft’s WinUI framework to follow the Fluent design language
    of Windows 11, and you can even adjust the window backdrop to Mica to match Arc’s
    background to your desktop or Acrylic for a transparent blur effect.

    for a Windows 10 version soon. And while Google launched a [native ARM64 version
    of Chrome](/2024/3/26/24112273/chrome-native-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-snapdragon)
    for Windows recently, Arc won’t be available natively for the upcoming round of
    Arm-powered Windows laptops this summer.

- en: “We’ve already ported Swift to work on Windows ARM64, which means that it’s
    feasible for us to move to that,” explains Abdulrasool. “It’s something we’re
    investigating, but it wasn’t an immediate priority because a lot of people don’t
    have access to this hardware yet.”

- en: The Arc for Windows release will also now sync to Arc Search, the iOS app that
    previously only worked with Arc for macOS. The Browser Company is also developing
    an Android version of Arc Search, so that will certainly help make Arc feel even
    more cross-platform.
