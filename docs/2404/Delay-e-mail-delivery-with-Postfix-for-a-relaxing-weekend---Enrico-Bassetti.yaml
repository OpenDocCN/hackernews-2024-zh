    and relaxing weekend. Unfortunately, it is not so easy: open-source projects you
    are contributing to, friends, hobbies, and newsletters are all good reasons to
    read e-mails once in a while.'

    want to read them on the weekend. Let’s implement some “delay-until-Monday” feature
    in Postfix!

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**active** is the queue containing e-mail scheduled to be sent. This queue
    has a fixed capacity to avoid overloading Postfix, as these e-mails are the next
    to be sent (you don’t want your system to try to send more than 200k e-mails at
    the same time, do you?);'
  prefs:

    so e-mails are queued here and picked up later for retry;'

    ACL says so, and they are moved to other queues using the `postsuper` command.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Theoretically, we may just need to keep the e-mail in the *incoming* queue until
    the right moment or move it to the *active* queue and schedule the delivery later.
    However, neither approaches are really in line with the description of those queues,
    and, as far as I know, there is no easy way to do that.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Postfix can look up information in *tables* by matching specific parts of the
    e-mail (or the envelope) in them to get back other information, such as actions,
    alias destinations, allowed hosts, and many more. These tables can be stored in
    a local file or in some network services. It is very handy, as you can basically
    [link Postfix to a database server to query for e-mails and stuff](https://www.postfix.org/pgsql_table.5.html),
    and this is basically what everyone (who has a large number of addresses) does.

    parameter in the Postfix configuration (as we see later), all e-mails coming from
    `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` will be moved to the *hold*
    queue, yay!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is that there doesn’t seem to be any way to assign a time period
    to this rule. This means that the rule will always match, even if you use `postsuper`
    to remove it from the queue! It does not work that well. What else can we use?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turns out we can use a database for that. If you are already using a database,
    that’s completely fine. However, I don’t have it, as my Postfix setup is very
    minimal. In this case, we can just use `sqlite` as a database and query a local
    file with some SQL magic.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    modify the `/etc/postfix/main.cf`. Specifically, you want to alter the `smtpd_sender_restrictions`
    parameter to add your table. Keep in mind that the configured actions are executed
    using the exact order you specify in the configuration. So, you want your query
    to be executed last, or at least after the usual checks for blocklists, unknown
    recipient domains, etc.

    person sends you an e-mail at 00:01 on Monday, that e-mail will be delivered to
    your account (also, before the others that will be released at 5am). If your friend
    is a night owl, you may want to tweak the database structure to store also some
    time information there.
