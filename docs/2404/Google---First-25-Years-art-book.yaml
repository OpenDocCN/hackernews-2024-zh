- en: Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Google had a third founder?
    It's hard to say for sure. Maybe Google would have had a different name, or perhaps
    it would have been sold in 2000\. One thing we do know is that there was a potential
    third founder. But before we dive into this, let's take a moment to consider what
    that founder missed out on.

- en: Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the only two who own the majority of the company.
    As of today, their stock alone is worth 100's of billions of dollars combined.
    But actually, there was to be a potential third founder, and his name was Scott
    Hassan.In 1996, Sergey and Larry worked at Stanford on a project called BackRub.
    There was initially an unofficial founder called Scott Hassan.

    search engine. He left before Google could be founded as a company. Larry initially
    considered a dissertation topic exploring the connection between mathematics and
    the World Wide Web. He envisioned it as a vast graph. After discussing the idea
    with his advisor, Terry Winograd, who was enthusiastic about it, Terry encouraged
    him to pursue the topic further. Page later reflected on this advice as "The best
    advice I ever got."

    Wide Web and understanding its link structure as a huge graph. The challenge is
    to link a page to other online web pages and determine why it is an excellent
    page to bring up for a search query. While academic papers use citations to link
    to written works, the online world lacks this measure. Larry discussed his dilemma
    with Hassan, who helped him create the code gradually.'

    known as "BackRub," a name that will be discussed later in this chapter.

- en: By March 1996, Page had a web crawler, which was the starting point for him
    to convert backlink data and use it later down the line. Then to make sense of
    the results, the PageRank algorithm was created. Larry Page would say that Scott
    Hassan and Alan Steremberg, also a computer engineer from Stanford, were pivotal
    to the creation of BackRub and Google's success. That's always interesting to
    see how founders honor the work of previous individuals who helped build Google.
    Usually, those in the early stages know the struggles that occurred along the
    way.

- en: Scott Hassan programmed the original Google search engine, then known as BackRub.
    At the time, he was a research assistant at Stanford University. But he left Google
    before it was founded as a company. In 1998 Scott bought 160,000 Google shares
    for $800, worth $13 billion today. Even though he did not continue with Google,
    he developed more projects. One included FindMail, later named eGroups.com, which
    was an email management site. Yahoo eventually purchased that for $432 million
    and renamed it Yahoo Groups. His last noted business venture was with a robotics
    research lab called Willow Garage for robotics software, which closed in early
    2014.

- en: Going from BackRub and coding the first iteration of the Google search engine
    is not easy. It is impressive that he helped build a search engine that is still
    the most popular today. Although he is not the third member of the founder group
    of Google, He performed well with his Google shares and the Yahoo acquisition
    of his company. While Google did not have a third founder, it was interesting
    to see how BackRub did play a role in the company. Every product has to start
    somewhere.
