- en: AMD was recently in hot waters regarding its software and AI support under ROCm.
    Companies such as [George Hotz's](https://twitter.com/__tinygrad__/status/1770155923211997403?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1770155923211997403%7Ctwgr%5Eb225cbf7218d4c79f18ff26dfe9c88ccc74c241a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Ftinycorp-ditches-amd-tinybox-ai-package-opt-for-nvidia-or-intel-options%2F),
    TinyGrad, [called out AMD for its unstable driver support,](https://wccftech.com/tinycorp-ditches-amd-tinybox-ai-package-opt-for-nvidia-or-intel-options/)
    leading to a very unstable experience using the Radeon RX GPUs. One of the solutions
    proposed was to make the Radeon Software and ROCm open-source so that the community
    could offer driver fixes & various optimizations.

    and is now going to open-source additional portions of its software stack and
    hardware documentation. In addition to that, AMD has also created a tracker called
    "[fuzzyHSA](https://github.com/nod-ai/fuzzyHSA/issues)" which will capture feedback
    and provide updates on the go. Replying to the tiny corp, AMD states that they
    are focused on providing software and firmware updates to address the reported
    issues. Their software team is working on these now and will report the latest
    status on GitHub relatively soon.

    consumer-level hardware, such as the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, Radeon RX 7900 XT, Radeon
    RX 7900 GRE, Radeon Pro W7900 and Radeon Pro W7800](https://wccftech.com/amd-preps-for-rocm-6-1-release-coming-enhanced-support-features/).
    These coupled with a range of AI optimizations have delivered a strong software
    stack and the open-source nature may just help them get their things going forward.

    and [Intel's oneAPI,](https://wccftech.com/qualcomm-intel-google-join-hands-to-come-nvidia-plans-on-dethroning-cuda-oneapi/)
    with the former being the undisputed leader in the AI segment right now and the
    latter being worked on by various companies, including Chipzilla, as a means to
    tackle CUDA. So it will be interesting to see where AMD's ROCm falls after the
    open-sourcing initiates.
