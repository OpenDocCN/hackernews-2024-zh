- en: In an earlier life I wrote addons for [World of Warcraft](http://www.wow-europe.com).
    Aside from being addicted to the game at the time, it was a mindblowing experience
    for someone obsessed with plugin architectures and the evolution of public APIs.
    It was also a great excuse to learn [Lua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29),
    which is a fun language.

    FriendNet helped to deal with the greatest challenge in the game: Finding people
    to play with who aren''t dicks. The addon took your in-game friend list and shared
    it with all your friends. In return, they shared their friends with you. As a
    result the number of people you could trust weren''t dicks increased.'

    had to come up with a hack to distribute those friend lists. What we did was serialize
    those lists into in-game chat messages and whisper them to the receiving player's
    avatar.

    over the chat channels of a virtual world. We should have gotten funding.

- en: Anyway, FriendNet did have some quality issues. P2P applications are hard to
    get right, and you can't just make people upgrade every time you release a bugfix.
    So we had all those different versions talking with each other, resulting in a
    lot of emergent behaviour and hard to reproduce bugs.

    encounter a corrupt message, resulting in parts of the addon GUI to be messed
    up. We received enough bug reports to believe that the issue was real, but we
    could never reproduce the bug no matter how hard we tried. It was the bug from
    hell. Eventually we gave up, blamed it on a buggy API and moved on.'

    it from. I doubt it would even boot up in a current version of the game. But even
    though I never got to fix that bug, I still remember it with fond amusement.
