    thought that anyone would read it, and I was fooling around with a home-brewed
    client-side templating system. It's still a totally free website with no ads and
    an RSS feed. If you feel very strongly about it, I would welcome a financial sponsorship
    to migrate, and I'll even put up a "thank you" banner for you and/or your company.
    Otherwise, I'd rather spend my unpaid non-work time writing more posts than migrating
    off a system that frankly works pretty well for me. Thank you for understanding.
