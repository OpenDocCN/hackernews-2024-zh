    years when her hospital revealed shocking news: She should have been put on the
    transplant list in 2015 instead of 2019 — and a racially biased organ test was
    to blame.'

    failure and evaluation for a transplant, [exacerbating other disparities](https://apnews.com/article/science-health-organ-transplants-daf56643587acbbb77990b1f2f900cff)

    Black patient to see if they, too, should have been referred sooner.'

    far more than 2,800 of them, including Evans, have received a transplant.

- en: The eGFR, or estimated glomerular filtration rate, evaluates kidney health based
    on how quickly a waste compound called creatinine gets filtered from blood. In
    1999, an equation used to calculate eGFR was modified to adjust Black people’s
    results compared to everyone else’s, based on some studies with small numbers
    of Black patients and a long-ago false theory about differences in creatinine
    levels. Until recently that meant many lab reports would list two results — one
    calculated for non-Black patients and another for Black patients that could overestimate
    kidney function by as much as 16%.

    diagnosed without that test. For others to have a chance at benefitting from UNOS’
    mandated lookback, transplant center staff-turned-detectives often worked after
    hours and weekends, hunting years-old records for a test that, recalculated without
    the race adjustment, might make the difference.

    didn’t feel like work after that.”
