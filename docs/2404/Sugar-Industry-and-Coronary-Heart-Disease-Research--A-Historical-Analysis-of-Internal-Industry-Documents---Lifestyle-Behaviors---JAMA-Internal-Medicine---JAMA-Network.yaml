- en: Early warning signals of the coronary heart disease (CHD) risk of sugar (sucrose)
    emerged in the 1950s. We examined Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) internal documents,
    historical reports, and statements relevant to early debates about the dietary
    causes of CHD and assembled findings chronologically into a narrative case study.
    The SRF sponsored its first CHD research project in 1965, a literature review
    published in the *New England Journal of Medicine,* which singled out fat and
    cholesterol as the dietary causes of CHD and downplayed evidence that sucrose
    consumption was also a risk factor. The SRF set the review’s objective, contributed
    articles for inclusion, and received drafts. The SRF’s funding and role was not
    disclosed. Together with other recent analyses of sugar industry documents, our
    findings suggest the industry sponsored a research program in the 1960s and 1970s
    that successfully cast doubt about the hazards of sucrose while promoting fat
    as the dietary culprit in CHD. Policymaking committees should consider giving
    less weight to food industry–funded studies and include mechanistic and animal
    studies as well as studies appraising the effect of added sugars on multiple CHD
    biomarkers and disease development.
