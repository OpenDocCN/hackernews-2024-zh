    logic onto a modular card that could be swapped out, usually to switch between
    PCL or PostScript "personalities." The PostScript module was offered mostly for
    MacOS compatibility, Apple having selected PostScript as a common printer control

    dependent on the host computer to perform rasterization. While extremely irritating
    from the perspective of software support, this was an important cost-savings measure
    in consumer printers. Executing a capable printer control language was rather
    demanding; the Apple LaserWriter famously had a faster processor than the Macintosh
    computers it was a peripheral to. Printers with independent rasterization, particularly
    the more complex PostScript, came at a substantial price premium to those that
    required the host to perform rasterization.

    LaserWriter就以比其外围Macintosh计算机更快的处理器而著称。独立栅格化的打印机，特别是更复杂的PostScript，与需要主机执行栅格化的打印机相比，价格显著高出一大截。

    that it was in fact rasterizing on device (like the curiously specific limit of
    "up to 79" TrueType fonts), I'm fairly sure it was indeed a precursor to the later
    inexpensive designs. Rather than a cost-savings measure, though, Microsoft seems
    to have marketed it as a premium feature. Because of the Windows Printing System's
    higher level of integration with the operating system, it brought numerous new
    features, many of which we take for granted today. TrueType font support at all,
    for example, a cutting-edge feature in '93\. Duplex control from the print dialog

    Windows 打印系统与操作系统的更高级别集成，它带来了许多新功能，其中许多我们今天都视为理所当然的。例如，在 '93 年，TrueType 字体支持就是一个前沿功能。从打印对话框而不是打印机自身显示控制双面打印，并且，能够在刚刚打印的计算机上查看打印机状态消息（如“PC

    WinPad 过程中遇到问题而不得不减少规模的诱人可能性，但看起来更可能是因为过于热衷的电子行业新闻和微软发言人承认受到的世嘉保密协议的影响。
- en: MAW failed to win the market, and WinPad failed to win a BillG review. The project
    was canceled. From the ashes of WinPad and the similarly failed Pegasus, some
    of the same people started work on a brand new project, Pulsar, which would become
    Windows CE.

    Windows CE。

- en: 'Update: Alert reader abrasive (James Wah) writes in that they had previously
    dumped the CD-ROM firmware from the Saturn and performed some reverse engineering.
    Several things suggest that it was not developed by Microsoft, including a Hitachi
    copyright notice. It seems likely, then, that the supposed Microsoft-Sega partnership
    never produced anything or was never real in the first place.'

  zh: 更新：细心的读者 abrasive（James Wah）提到，他们之前曾从 Saturn 光盘固件中倒出数据，并进行了一些逆向工程。几件事情表明这并非由微软开发，其中包括日立的版权声明。因此，看起来所谓的微软-世嘉合作可能从未产生过任何实质性的成果，或者一开始就不存在。
