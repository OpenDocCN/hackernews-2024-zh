    major reason for the decline is that many for-sale home builders foresaw “a massive

    product, which would probably trigger the ULA tax for any building over 15 units,
    according to Greg Harris, a real estate broker with Marcus and Millichap. Even
    developers who hold onto their properties typically need to take out a mortgage
    on the finished building — and Harris said lenders are willing to give less because
    they too would need to pay the tax if they foreclose and sell the property.
