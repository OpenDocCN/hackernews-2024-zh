- en: Apple's Vision Pro headset took the AR market by storm with its stunning looks
    and advanced technology underneath. While the headset had a solid start, the traction
    has reduced over time, potentially due to its hefty price tag and minimal real-world
    use cases. Prominent industry analyst claims that the demand for Vision Pro demos
    has greatly reduced, highlighting poor demand for the headset after initial hype.

    the attributes and applications for it, the hefty price tag is not for everyone.
    *[Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-21/apple-aapl-growth-opportunities-southeast-asia-and-africa-lower-end-iphone-lv9itkna)*
    from Bloomberg states that the Vision Pro excitement has dropped since its launch
    and there have been significant reductions in demand for demos and the product
    itself. The analyst states:'

    up, and sales — at least at some locations — have gone from a couple of units
    a day to just a handful in a whole week. Apple also has had to step up the marketing
    on its online homepage. There's a huge promo for the Vision Pro at the top of
    the website.

    adoption, as the VR category is not permeable for easier inception. Gurman also
    shared his experience with the Vision Pro and how he barely uses the device for
    work and even media consumption. He also states that the tedious work involved
    in attaching batteries, booting the device, and navigating the interface makes
    it an inconvenience compared to other devices like a laptop or a tablet.

    are yet to offer their apps for the platform, which is one of the reasons why
    the analyst sticks to his laptop, even for content consumption. Apple has yet
    to optimize its apps for the Vision Pro as well, and since it is a first-gen product,
    it might take some time for developers to curate bugs and issues for a seamless
    user experience.

    offer overall improvements along with a price reduction, allowing the headset
    to become a [mainstream product](https://wccftech.com/vision-pro-2-success-depends-on-these-factors/).
    So far, Apple is planning to manufacture 400,000 units of the device this year
    due to production issues. The Vision Pro will be available in additional countries
    later this year, which could increase sales figures.
