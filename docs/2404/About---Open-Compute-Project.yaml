- en: In 2009, Facebook was growing exponentially, offering new services and giving
    millions of people a platform to share photos and videos. Looking ahead, the company
    realized that it had to rethink its infrastructure to accommodate the huge influx
    of new people and data, and also control costs and energy consumption.

    data center, one that could handle unprecedented scale at the lowest possible
    cost. A small team of engineers spent the next two years designing and building
    one from the ground up: software, servers, racks, power supplies, and cooling.
    The result now stands in Prineville, Oregon.'

    to apply the benefits of open source and open collaboration to hardware and rapidly
    increase the pace of innovation in, near and around the data center’s networking
    equipment, general purpose and GPU servers, storage devices and appliances, and
    scalable rack designs. OCP’s collaboration model is being applied beyond the data
    center, helping to advance the telecom industry & EDGE infrastructure.
