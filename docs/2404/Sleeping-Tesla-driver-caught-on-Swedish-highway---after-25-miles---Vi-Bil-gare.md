**The incident took** place in January on the Swedish highway E4\. The driver, who works for a car delivery company, was driving a 2019 Tesla Model X when he suddenly fell asleep at the wheel outside Linköping, south of the capital Stockholm.

Despite its name, Tesla's Autopilot system does not make the car autonomous. The driver has to remain alert and pay attention to the road and other road users.

Another driver, who also owns a Tesla, was approaching the Model X which was being driven in the overtaking lane without overtaking anyone. The other Tesla driver switched to the right-hand lane and tried to pass the Model X, when he noticed that the driver was asleep.

The police arrived and attempted multiple times to wake the driver up, but he continued to sleep while the car ”drove by itself.” At last, the driver woke up and the Tesla suddenly turned to the right. The driver of the police car had to swerve and brake in order not to crash.
