    done, hence the results are not yet very robust. However, the first results already
    show quite an inspiring curve unveiling a beautiful natural pattern!

    tend to be thicker at the bottom of the pole and thinner at the top. These kinds
    of variations have a significant impact on how the craftsman can work with bamboo
    and what he can or cannot do with the different sections.

- en: For instance, if a craftsman wants to cut a straight strip, its length will
    be limited by the length of the internode. Moreover, the strips might tend to
    be thick for an internode that is close to the bottom of the pole, and thin for
    an internode that is close to the top of the pole. To build my [trivet](/en/post/rustic-bamboo-trivet-for-hot-pots-homemade-easy-technique/)
    I used for example an internode from the base of a bamboo pole. While for my [underwear
    dryer](/en/post/making-an-elegant-underwear-dryer-in-bamboo-simple-tools-and-easy/),
    a bamboo section with slightly thinner walls — located higher up — was sufficient.

- en: Even if many techniques can be used by the craftsman, for instance straightening
    the strips using heat, understanding closely the structure of bamboo poles can
    elegantly save time and energy. The craftsman will know better which pole to harvest
    for a specific use, and fewer steps and tools might then be necessary to reach
    the final crafted object. Experienced bamboo craftmen already have this knowledge.
    But for beginners, trying to understand bamboo by observing it is very useful.

    base and longer at the top; and bamboo pole wall seems thicker at the bottom and
    thinner at the top. Do these dimensions really follow patterns all along the pole,
    or are they actually hazardous? What might be the shapes of these patterns? And
    do these patterns depend on other variables, such as species?

    the level of the small roots covering the lower node. The measurement was accurate
    to the nearest centimeter, due to irregularities in the bamboo pole: the limits
    corresponding to the nodes were not perpendicular to the axis of the pole, but
    slightly tilted; and the diameter of the pole tended to be larger at the level
    of nodes than in the internodes. Measurements are hence not very precise but enough
    to meet our objectives.'

    The measurement was accurate to the nearest 0.5 centimeters. As the wall thickness
    is not always even, I averaged 3 measures taken more or less at equidistance from
    one another. Measuring the wall thickness for each internode would be ideal, but
    it would have required to cut the pole in small sections, preventing me to use
    it for other purposes that I planned — it is in particular an internode of this
    bamboo from which I built the [trivet](/en/post/rustic-bamboo-trivet-for-hot-pots-homemade-easy-technique/)!

    to 5 mm at the 14^(th) internode. I did 3 measurements for each of the 4 internodes
    measured, but some dots are merged on the figure, when values were identical.
    I can infer a rough statistical model from these measurements, to predict the
    thickness of the wall depending on the location along the bamboo pole. No data
    was collected for the internodes after the 14^(th), but the model suggests a potential
    wall thickness of about 2 mm for the last internode.

    However, the dataset is quite small and restricted to only one bamboo, which does
    not make for our statistical model to be robust, despite its apparently high R²
    of about 0.99.

- en: The length of each internode could be measured as the average of the longer
    and shorter lengths between the tilted limits of the internode. The thickness
    of the wall could be measured systematically at the middle of each internode,
    instead of close to the nodes, as the wall appear to be thicker close to the nodes.
    Moreover, measuring several bamboo poles for a given species in a given location,
    instead of only one, would also improve the reliability of the results.

    age of the bamboo pole, as bamboo does not have any secondary growth over its
    lifespan. However, it would be very interesting to see if there might be variations
    of patterns due to species and location!
