    [Lacework](https://techcrunch.com/tag/lacework/) — a cloud security startup that
    was valued at $8.3 billion post-money in its last funding round — is in talks

  zh: 在安全领域的整合继续进行。消息人士告诉我们，Lacework —— 一家云安全创业公司，在其上一轮融资中后估值达到了 83 亿美元 —— 正在与另一家安全公司
    Wiz 进行收购谈判，交易金额仅为 1.5 亿至 2 亿美元。
- en: Sources close to the negotiations said that the two companies have already signed
    a letter of intent and described the state of negotiations as “somewhere in the
    middle.” That is to say, the acquisition is not yet completed and the deal could
    still fall through.

  zh: 与谈判密切相关的消息人士称，两家公司已签署了意向书，并描述了谈判状态为“中途”。也就是说，收购尚未完成，交易仍有可能失败。
- en: Although both work in the wider area of cloud security, sources tell us that
    there is relatively little competitive overlap between the two companies, so it
    would likely be a technology-plus-talent-plus-customer acquisition play. We are
    still trying to find out more terms of the deal, such as whether it would be in
    stock, cash or a mix.

  zh: 尽管两者都在更广泛的云安全领域工作，但消息来源告诉我们，这两家公司之间的竞争重叠相对较少，因此这很可能是一场技术加才加客户的收购。我们仍在努力了解交易的更多细节，例如是否是以股票、现金或混合方式进行。

    are dedicated to pushing this growth even further. Simultaneously, we recognize
    that consolidation is the future of the security industry and therefore are actively
    engaged in discussions with companies across the industry. We are always exploring
    compelling M&A opportunities that will enhance both our technological capabilities
    and business expansion, as we strive to build the world’s leading cloud security
    platform.”

    reach its goal. Lacework, we understand, has ARR of around $100 million.

    正计划在 IPO 之前达到每年 10 亿美元的年度重复收入。我们了解到其软性截止日期为 2025 年底，但考虑到公司在 2024 年 2 月仅宣布了 3.5
    亿美元的 ARR，该公司必须采取积极措施以实现其目标。我们了解到，Lacework 的 ARR 大约为 1 亿美元。
