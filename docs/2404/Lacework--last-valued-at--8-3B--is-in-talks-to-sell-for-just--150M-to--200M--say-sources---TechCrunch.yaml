- en: Consolidation continues apace in the world of security. Sources tell us that
    [Lacework](https://techcrunch.com/tag/lacework/) — a cloud security startup that
    was valued at $8.3 billion post-money in its last funding round — is in talks
    to be acquired by another security player, [Wiz](https://techcrunch.com/tag/wiz/),
    for a price of just $150 million to $200 million.

- en: Sources close to the negotiations said that the two companies have already signed
    a letter of intent and described the state of negotiations as “somewhere in the
    middle.” That is to say, the acquisition is not yet completed and the deal could
    still fall through.

- en: Although both work in the wider area of cloud security, sources tell us that
    there is relatively little competitive overlap between the two companies, so it
    would likely be a technology-plus-talent-plus-customer acquisition play. We are
    still trying to find out more terms of the deal, such as whether it would be in
    stock, cash or a mix.

    are dedicated to pushing this growth even further. Simultaneously, we recognize
    that consolidation is the future of the security industry and therefore are actively
    engaged in discussions with companies across the industry. We are always exploring
    compelling M&A opportunities that will enhance both our technological capabilities
    and business expansion, as we strive to build the world’s leading cloud security
    platform.”

    a previous security startup, Adallom, to Microsoft — has said on a number of occasions
    (such as [here](https://forbes.co.il/e/wiz-announces-350m-in-annual-recurring-revenue-targets-1b/))
    that Wiz is looking to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue ahead of an
    IPO. We understand that its soft deadline is the end of 2025, but considering
    it [announced](https://www.newswire.com/news/the-road-to-1-billion-in-arr-wiz-appoints-dali-rajic-to-president-22235455)
    ARR of only $350 million in February 2024, the company has to get aggressive to
    reach its goal. Lacework, we understand, has ARR of around $100 million.

    but some companies that have reached high valuations over recent years are struggling
    to justify those numbers and are considering their options as they come close
    to the end of their funding runway.'

    Ventures, GV, General Catalyst, Tiger Global and many more — were shopping the
    company around to potential buyers, which is how Wiz came into the frame.

    haircut. Just last week, TechCrunch broke the news that [Noname was in talks to
    be acquired by Akamai for $500 million](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/12/akamai-acquisition-talks-noname-security/),
    after last being valued at $1 billion.

    en route to its IPO. Earlier this month Wiz [acquired](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/bjbiulexr)
    Gem Security for $350 million, and it sounds like the M&A will not end with Lacework.

- en: Lacework, founded nearly nine years ago and based in San Jose, California, has
    raised over $1.8 billion from investors over the years. Most of that funding —
    $1.3 billion — ties to a late November 2021 round that, at the time, valued the
    company at $8.3 billion.
