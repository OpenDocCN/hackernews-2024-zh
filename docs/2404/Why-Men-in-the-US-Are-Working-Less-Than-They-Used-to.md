# Why Men in the US Are Working Less Than They Used to

> 来源：[https://www.businessinsider.com/us-men-working-less-recessions-employment-productivity-2024-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-men-working-less-recessions-employment-productivity-2024-4)

America's working-age men are employed at much lower rates than they used to be, and a combination of factors — from recessions to globalization to rising addiction rates — could be playing a role.

As such, many men are [struggling](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/men-workforce-work-companies-struggle-fill-jobs-manufacturing/) to support themselves financially. And mental-health experts say the longer people are out of the workforce, the higher the chances they'll experience [mental-health](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-13-144#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20these%20results%20indicate,on%20unemployment%20is%20somewhat%20stronger.) challenges.

Here are a few factors that could explain what's happening.

## **It could be about recessions**

Since the 1950s, whenever the US economy fell into a recession, men's employment rate tended to suffer a longer-lasting blow.

When the economy entered a recession in 1953,the share of prime-age men with jobs dropped from 96% to 92.8%and never fully recovered to the prerecession level, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This pattern repeated in many of the recessions that followed. During the Great Recession of 2008, the prime-age male employment rate fell from 88% to 80.6% — and hasn't reached above 86.7% since. The pandemic recession may prove to be an exception: After falling to as low as 78% in 2020, men's employment rate has nearly recovered to its pre-pandemic level.

"In recent decades, declines in labor-force participation have tended to accompany recessions," Abigail Wozniak, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told Business Insider in February. "Participation dips and then does not fully recover.

Why have recessions appeared to have such a lasting impact on working men? Even when the economy recovers, some occupations [don't reach](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/the-long-shadow-of-the-2001-recession) prior employment levels — or [pay as well](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-the-great-recession-for-americas-youth/) as they used to. Given that men have historically dominated the workforce, they've borne the brunt of these impacts.

"If the opportunities available after a downturn pay less than the old opportunities, workers may decide not to work as much despite their lower income," Wozniak said.

And the longer someone is out of the workforce, the [more disconnected](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2023/eb_23-10) from the workforce they can become, research has found.

The [strong employment-recovery](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-fast-is-economic-recovery-pandemic-december-jobs-report-2022-1) rate after the pandemic recession could be due to the unique nature of this downturn — which tanked an otherwise healthy economy. Some economists believe that increased [federal COVID-19 spending](https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-package-pandemic-surpass-great-recession-fiscal-plans-recovery-2021-3) allowed the economy to bounce back better this go-round.

The male unemployment rate is [low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU04000061) when compared to past decades. But this measure [doesn't account](https://www.businessinsider.com/unemployment-rate-if-discouraged-workers-came-back-2014-1) for men who have, for a multitude of reasons, stopped looking for work altogether, which could help account for the lower percentage of men in the workforce.

In 1950, about 97% of prime-working-age men had a job or were actively looking for work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of January, that figure had fallen to roughly 89%.

## **Many men with disabilities aren't working**

In 1960, roughly [455,000 workers](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/di_asr/2022/di_asr22.pdf) collected [Social Security disability benefits](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/can-you-buy-a-house-on-disability). In 2022, more than 7.6 million people, including about 1.3 million men between the ages of 25 and 54, collected disability benefits.

Some of this can be attributed to a growing and aging population and the [expansion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220738/#:~:text=Over%20the%20years%20the%20SSDI,qualifying%20requirements%20for%20disability%20benefits.) of these benefits over time. However, a challenging job market has also played a role.

"What drives people to apply for disability is, in many cases, the repeated loss of work and inability to find new employment," David Autor, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2017/03/30/disabled-or-just-desperate/) The Washington Post in 2017\. "Many people who are applying would say, 'Look, I would like to work, but no one would employ me.'"

In 2023, [about 44%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/disabl.pdf) of total men and women with a disability between the ages of 25 and 54 had a job, compared to roughly 83% of those without a disability, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which determines whether someone has a disability through a [series of questions](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/disabl.pdf).

In a 2022 analysis of Census data by the San Francisco Fed, [nearly 40%](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2023/10/mens-falling-labor-force-participation-across-generations/) of prime-working-age men cited disability or illness as the reason they weren't working.

In more recent decades, addiction rates tied to the [opioid epidemic](https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-americas-deadly-synthetic-opioid-epidemic-2021-11) have also [sidelined](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-economic-impact-of-the-opioid-epidemic/) some men from the workforce.

In recent years,the rise of remote work and [historically high](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL) job openings have helped more people with disabilities find employment. In 2023, [nearly 23%](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/disabl.pdf) of Americans with a disability were employed — the largest share on record since data collection began in 2008, according to the BLS.

## **Other theories: Education, incarceration, and stay-at-home dads**

There are other potential explanations for the decline of men in the workforce, including the rising share of men attending [graduate school](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/educational-attainment.html) and more men working as [stay-at-home dads](https://www.businessinsider.com/men-are-dropping-out-workforce-be-stay-at-home-dads-2022-12) or [caring for elderly parents](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/things-should-do-providing-care-for-elderly-parents-2022-2).

Changing demand for jobs, driven in part by [globalization](https://www.businessinsider.com/nobel-prize-economist-angus-deaton-rethinks-unions-free-trade-immigration-2024-4) and [automation](https://www.businessinsider.com/automation-labor-market-wage-inequality-middle-class-jobs-study-2021-6), has also hurt the job prospects of many men, particularly those employed in the [manufacturing industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-manufacturing-factories-save-america-economy-future-crappy-service-jobs-2022-7). More employers began seeking out candidates with [higher levels](https://www.vox.com/policy/23628627/degree-inflation-college-bacheors-stars-labor-worker-paper-ceiling) of education, which has [made it difficult](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/22/jobs-no-college-degree/#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20men%20without%20college,women%20into%20the%20same%20situation.) for some men in the [job market](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/unemployment-earnings-education.htm).

What's more, men now account for [less than half](https://www.businessinsider.com/growing-trend-fewer-men-in-college-leading-to-mating-crisis-2021-9) of college enrollees. Among Americans 25 and older, the [unemployment rate](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/unemployment-earnings-education.htm) of people with only a high school diploma is 3.9%, compared to 2.2% for those whose highest educational attainment is a bachelor's degree, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In recent years, some companies have become more open to [hiring candidates](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ibm-accenture-dell-companies-no-longer-require-college-degrees-2023-3) who don't have a college degree. There's also been job growth in industries that historically haven't required degrees, like [manufacturing](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-is-experiencing-factory-boom-but-finding-workers-is-difficult-2023-7) and [food services](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES7072200001). But [finding a job](https://www.businessinsider.com/college-degree-good-job-market-skill-based-hiring-employers-2024-2) without a degree — and one that [pays well](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:wages) — can still be a challenge.

In 2016, the Harvard economist Jason Furman, then the chair of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, [attributed](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/men-not-at-work-why-so-many-men-ages-of-25-to-54-are-not-working/) the decline of prime-age working men largely to the "reduction in the demand for unskilled labor" driven by technological change, adding that men without jobs tended not to have a college education.

Additionally, he said most of these men weren't spending more time on childcare than the average man and weren't relying on working women to pay the bills — suggesting they weren't stay-at-home dads, for instance.

Elise Gould, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told Business Insider that a stagnant [minimum wage](https://www.businessinsider.com/map-the-last-time-each-state-raised-its-minimum-wage-2021-2) and falling [unionization rates](https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-union-membership-fell-lowest-rate-record-2022-2023-1) have contributed to lower pay for some workers. The lower the pay, the less motivated some people might be to take a job.

Some more under-the-radar factors could also be playing a role.

Rising [incarceration rates](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf) in recent decades could be making it [difficult](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/poverty-journal/blog/mass-incarceration-and-the-male-labor-problem-the-need-for-data-and-solutions/) for some men to find work once they [return to society](https://www.businessinsider.com/getting-a-job-after-prison-2014-10), Gould said. Incarcerated men [aren't counted](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/2021/05/17/2-3-million-incarcerated-people-excluded-from-aspiration-of-full-employment/#:~:text=Today%2C%20with%202.3%20million%20incarcerated,definition%20of%20the%20labor%20force.) in government labor-force statistics, but when they are released, their struggles to find work could depress the average male-employment rate.

In the past, many men opted for careers in the military, but there are fewer of these jobs than there used to be. In 1970, there were over [3 million](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B4380C0A173NBEA) full-time federal government military employees — as of 2022, there were less than 1.5 million.

"Post-World War II, we've seen pretty big declines since the late '60s and throughout the 1990s in terms of federal employment in the military," Gould said.

While the military is actively seeking recruits, it appears to be a [less attractive](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/05/1203766333/us-army-military-recruit-pentagon-air-force-navy) path nowadays for many men —the Army, Navy, and Air Force have [struggled](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-war-for-talent-struggle-to-attract-immigrants-2018-3) to meet recruitment goals.

Over the past decade, some men have begun working full-time in the [gig economy](https://www.businessinsider.com/gig-economy-trends-workers-delivery-ride-hailing-apps-uber-doordash-2023-7). While these people, who include drivers for companies like Uber and DoorDash, should [generally](https://www.bls.gov/blog/2016/why-this-counts-measuring-gig-work.htm) be picked up by government employment surveys, it's [possible](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-not-working-dont-have-jobs-sidehustles-labor-force-2022-11) some of them have slipped through the cracks.

Research by the Federal Reserve economist John M. Coglianese published in 2018 [found](https://www.johncoglianese.com/publication/in-and-outs/in-and-outs.pdf) that a rise of "in-and-outs" — men who temporarily leave the labor force but ultimately return, was responsible for a large chunk of men's declining working rates.

And of course, some lucky prime-age men aren't working because they've had a lot of financial success and [already retired](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/early-retirement-top-tips-from-people-who-did-it-2019-8).

With so many factors at play, it's difficult to tease out which issues may affect the number of men in the workforce the most — and what kind of policy decisions could reverse the trend.

"I think that ideally, we would have jobs for everybody who wants one," Gould said.
