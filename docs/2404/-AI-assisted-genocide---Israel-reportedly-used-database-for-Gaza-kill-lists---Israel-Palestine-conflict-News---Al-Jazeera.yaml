    Lavender had an error rate of about 10 percent. “But that didn’t stop the Israelis
    from using it to fast-track the identification of often low-level Hamas operatives
    in Gaza and bombing them,” Challands said.

    conduct “independent examinations” to verify that the identified targets meet
    the relevant definitions in accordance with international law and additional restrictions

    a database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources, in order

    civilian deaths in Gaza, according to Challands.
