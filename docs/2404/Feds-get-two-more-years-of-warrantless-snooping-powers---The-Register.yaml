    tool for another two years — and added a whole bunch of people and organizations
    to the list of those who can be compelled to spy for Uncle Sam.

    the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to President Biden, who swiftly

- en: Shortly before the bill's passage, senators shot down six amendments that would
    have reined in the US intelligence agencies' abilities to carry out effectively
    warrantless surveillance under Section 702\. These included an amendment that
    would have required federal agencies to show probable cause and obtain a warrant
    from America's secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court *before* accessing
    the private communications of US persons caught up in surveillance queries.

    to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic
    communications" may be required to hand these communications over to the Feds
    for their intelligence searches and analysis, as well as "custodians" of these
    so-called service providers.

    Center (NCTC) to collect up and snoop on phone calls, text messages, and emails
    involving select foreigners residing outside America, with the intent being to
    prevent these intelligence targets from committing terrorist acts or other serious
    crimes.

    not solely, American citizens, permanent residents, and corporate entities — then
    these messages are also scooped up for the Feds to pore over without first obtaining
