- en: However, the number of keystrokes grows linearly. Increasing the number of references
    to a few dozens already makes the task quite taxing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want the effort for repeated changes to grow in a non-linear fashion. We
    can do that using Command `D`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    text editors such as Sublime Text. Other text editors will have analogous keyboard
    shortcuts.'

    multi-cursor editing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    such as the above, but we're just scratching the surface. Combined with smart
    text navigation techniques, we can take Command `D` quite far.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `if` statements all have the exact same structure, so matching them is somewhat
    trivial. These sorts of patterns are the bread and butter of Command `D`, they're
    very common.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Command `D` is still very effective for non-uniform patterns. Those more
    complex patterns can come in the form of

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Since we have a lot of tests, doing this manually would be a lot of work. This
    is a prime case for using Command `D`, we just need to find a pattern to match.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we match `expectEqual` and move in from there, we run into the problem of
    the expressions being of different lengths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Matching the end runs into the same problem. The values are of different lengths.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If we try to match the commas `,` between the expression and the value, we
    also match commas within the expressions and expected values:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The expression and expected value can be of any length, so matching the start
    or end is of no use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, we can observe that the expression is always a string. The expression
    always ends with double quote `"` immediately followed by a comma `,`. That's
    a pattern we can match!

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the example above, we matched four tests. That's a pretty small number of
    tests, especially for a library that evaluates math expressions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pressing Command `D` three times is not a lot of work, but if the number of
    tests were increased to 1,000 we would need to press Command `D` 999 times. This
    goes against our goal of making repeated changes grow non-linearly.

- en: This is a nice time to introduce Shift Command `L`, which is the keyboard shortcut
    for *Select All Matches*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have to be a bit more careful with Shift Command `L`, since it selects **every**
    match in a file. You may match something that you did not intend to, which can
    occur outside of the current viewport.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this reason, I prefer Command `D` when working with a small number of matches.
    The matching feels more local, you visually see every match happen.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When selecting matches, you may want to skip an instance. To skip a match, press
    Command `K` followed by Command `D`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to skip a match, you first need to add the match to the selection.
    After you have added a match to your selection, press Command `K` and Command `D`
    to unselect it and select the next match.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pressing Command `K` and Command `D` resolves to a command called **Move Last
    Selection to Next Find Match**. It's quite a technical name, but basically means
  prefs: []

    Command `D` to make this happen.
  prefs: []

    In VS Code, you can run it by opening the command prompt with Shift Command `P`
    and then typing the name of the command.
