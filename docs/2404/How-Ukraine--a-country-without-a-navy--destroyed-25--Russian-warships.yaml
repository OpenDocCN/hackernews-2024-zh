    clear end in sight. The borders have come to a standstill; the conflict on land
    is largely a stalemate. However, Ukraine has achieved a massive victory in the
    naval theatre.

    of the invasion, Russia had 74 surface vessels and 6 submarines. Many of these
    vessels were brought in specially for the invasion from other theatres (e.g. the
    Pacific and Arctic). This was important as Russia knew that the Turkish straits
    (the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles), which served as the only entry point into
    the Black Sea from the Aegean Sea, would be blocked by Turkey (a NATO member).
    Thus, Russia wanted to prepare a huge fleet from the get-go as they wouldn’t be
    able to reinforce it during the war. This naval fleet was led by the Moskva, a
    cruiser that served as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea navy.

    missiles (ATGMs) to destroy Russian warships. As the name suggests, anti-tank
    guided missiles are used to destroy tanks and other land-based heavily armoured
    vehicles. These can be shoulder-launched (operated by a single soldier) or tripod-mounted
    (operated by a squad of soldiers). In the Russo-Ukrainian war, the Ukrainian Skif
    ATGMs, the American FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles, the British NLAW ATGMs
    and the German Panzerfaust 3 disposable anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launchers
    have been used.

    tactical ballistic missile. Tactical ballistic missiles are used to destroy short-range
    (up to 120 km) targets on battlefields (e.g. ports, airbases, barracks and supply
    depots). This missile was introduced in military service by the Soviets in 1989
    (an earlier variant called just the Tochka was introduced in 1975). The Center
    for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reported that Ukraine had 500 OTR-21
    Tochka-U missiles in 2022.

    by Ukraine to destroy the Russian Black Sea fleet. Ukraine’s arsenal of these
    missiles consists of American Harpoon missiles (in operation since 1977), Franco-British
    Storm Shadow missiles (in operation since 2003) and their own R-360 Neptune missiles
    (in operation since 2021). The Neptune missiles have been particularly useful;
    as they have been recently developed, they are the most technologically advanced.
    Their long range of 200-300 km also made them extremely critical in many Ukrainian
    operations.

    the Russian Black Sea fleet. Aerial drones are known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) in military terms. Similarly, sea drones are known as Unmanned Surface
    Vehicles (USVs). The Ukrainians have used the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 UAVs (in operation
    since 2014) and their own MAGURA V5 USVs (in operation since 2023).

    later on 24 March, the Ukrainians attacked the port using OTR-21 Tochka-U tactical
    ballistic missiles. The Saratov subsequently caught on fire and eventually sank.
    The Novocherkassk and Tsezar Kunikov landing ships were damaged and had to be
    taken back to Sevastopol, after which they were made operational again. However,
    this was short-lived, as the Novocherkassk was sunk in 2023 and the Tsezar Kunikov
    was destroyed in 2024.

    loss for Russia in the Black Sea naval theatre. The Moskva was a guided missile
    cruiser, arguably the second most important type of warship (only behind the aircraft
    carrier). Guided missile cruisers are used to achieve air and sea superiority
    (also known as command of the sea), which can decide the outcome of battles and
    wars. The Moskva was critical in the Russian takeover of Snake Island on 24 February
    2022\. Ukraine wanted to regain control of Snake Island, and they believed sinking
    the Moskva would be integral in doing so.

    missiles, so it wasn’t a complete gamble. Still, the whole operation was a big

    including the port city of Odesa. Thus, the deadly combination of their long-range
    Neptune missiles and ability to launch UAVs and USVs off of their coastline has
    given Ukraine the power to strike the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea navy—Sevastopol
    (which they have done multiple times now). The western Black Sea is under Ukraine’s
    control and Russia knows this.

    to Novorossiysk, which is a port in Russia proper. Although Russia has not announced
    this formally, the shifting of Russia’s remaining warships from Sevastopol to
    Novorossiysk makes it the de facto headquarters of the Black Sea navy. But, they
    may not be done yet. Local leaders in Abkhazia (a Russian-occupied territory in
    Georgia which they captured in 2008) have revealed plans showing that Russia wants
    to relocate their Black Sea navy headquarters to the port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia.

    has a larger natural harbour than Novorossiysk (allowing more ships to be stored
    there). Moreover, Russia would be able to launch attacks into Ukraine from Georgia,
    which the Ukrainians can do very little about as Abkhazia is out of the range
    of their missiles and drones.

    a deep sea port on the Black Sea called Anaklia, which can potentially serve as
    a key checkpoint between oil and gas from Asia (from countries like Azerbaijan)
    and Europe. This plan to make a new route for the transfer of energy from Asia
    to Europe is known as the “Middle Corridor”. Russia likely wants to undermine
    the construction of this port to maintain the flow of Asian oil and gas through
    Russian territory (which is the case today as part of the “Northern Corridor”).

    way to sink/destroy warships costing up to hundreds of millions. This data would

    Aircraft carriers are essential in achieving air superiority during amphibious
    invasions. An aircraft carrier can be sent to faraway theatres of war, where it
    can launch fighters and bombers to carry out airstrikes on the battlefield. Submarines
    can be sent to the middle of oceans to destroy warships. Other warships like cruisers
    and battleships can be used to block chokepoints (e.g. what Turkey has done with
    the Turkish straits to prohibit more Russian warships from entering the Black
    Sea). If naval vessels are fitted with accurate anti-missile and anti-drone systems,
    a lot of this damage can be avoided, and navies can function normally. But, these
    systems can be expensive. Take the example of India. The Indian navy is planning
    on installing anti-drone systems in warships like the INS Vikramaditya and INS
    Vikrant. This has cost them about USD 60 million.
