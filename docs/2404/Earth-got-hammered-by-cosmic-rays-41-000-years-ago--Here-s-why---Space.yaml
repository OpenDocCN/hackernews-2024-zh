    cosmic rays. We're normally shielded from this barrage by Earth's magnetic bubble,
    the magnetosphere. But what happens when this shield weakens?

    nuclei blasted into space by powerful celestial events such as the [supernova](https://www.space.com/6638-supernova.html)
    deaths of massive stars. These incredibly energetic particles are normally intercepted
    by the [magnetosphere](https://www.space.com/earths-magnetic-field-explained),

- en: The magnetosphere is not a monolithic, unchanging entity, however. Not only
    does magnetic north "wobble" slightly away from geographic "true north," but the
    entire magnetosphere occasionally "flips." This results in the field's north pole
    becoming south and vice versa, with the intensity of the field waning in the process.

- en: In addition to this, there are other brief periods during which the two magnetic
    poles of the magnetosphere "disappear," to be replaced by a multitude of magnetic
    poles. During these periods, called "[magnetic field excursions](https://www.space.com/space-mysteries-why-do-earths-magnetic-poles-flip),"
    the strength of magnetic poles also weakens, implying that our planet is less
    well-protected from cosmic rays at these times.

    major upheavals in Earth's biosphere, the complete zone of our planet over which
    life exists, ranging from mountaintops to the deepest ocean trenches?

    has experienced a heavier than usual bombardment of cosmic rays, scientists can
    measure the abundances of different isotopes. These are variants of an element

    they create showers of  isotopes called "cosmogenic radionuclides" that rain down
    to our planet's surface. These build up over time in sediments, which scientists
    can study after recovering them from the sea bed and in ice cores drilled from
    regions like Antarctica and Greenland.

- en: One well-studied example of a magnetic field excursion is the Laschamps excursion,
    which occurred around 41,000 years ago. Panovska has been studying the relationship
    between the intensity of Earth's magnetosphere and the concentration of cosmogenic
    radionuclides such as beryllium-10 during this event.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She found that the average production rate of beryllium-10 doubled compared
    to the rate at which this cosmogenic radionuclide is generated by cosmic ray bombardment
    today. This indicates a very low magnetosphere intensity during the Laschamps
    excursion, leading to vastly more [cosmic rays](https://www.space.com/19786-cosmic-rays-origins-star-explosion.html)
    reaching Earth's atmosphere and creating showers of secondary particles.

    finding that it shrank during this event when its strength decreased. She is hoping
    this reconstruction will help her and fellow scientists get more information from
    cosmogenic radionuclide and cosmic ray bombardments.
