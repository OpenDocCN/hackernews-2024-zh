- en: This project uses a mini CT-scanner, which is different than the full-size donut
    scanners used in hospitals. By creating a "fish burrito", we can scan many fish
    at the same time, and it will only take only a few years to scan all the fishes
    in the world at our current rate thanks to our novel approach to scanning.
