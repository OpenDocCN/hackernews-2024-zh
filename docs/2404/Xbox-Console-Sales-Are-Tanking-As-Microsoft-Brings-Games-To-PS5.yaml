- en: The tech giant announced in [its third-quarter earnings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q3/more-personal-computing-performance)
    that Xbox Series X and S revenue is down 30 percent year-over-year. It blamed
    the nosedive on a “lower volume of consoles sold” during the start of 2024\. If
    that sounds like a repeat of last year, it’s because it is. “Xbox hardware revenue
    decreased 30% on a strong prior year comparable, driven by lower volume of consoles
    sold,” Microsoft [reported back in April 2023](https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665).

    to investors that there [were roughly 77 million “gen 9" consoles](https://kotaku.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-50-million-data-sony-microsoft-1851243811)
    in people’s homes. It didn’t take fans long to do the math and speculate that
    Microsoft had only sold around 25 million Xbox Series X/S consoles to-date. That
    puts it ahead of the GameCube but behind the Nintendo 64, at least for now. Given
    the results this quarter as well, it doesn’t seem like Game Pass and *Starfield*
    have moved the needle much.

    along with the rest of Activision Blizzard, finally makes its way to Game Pass.
    *Diablo IV* only just arrived on the Netflix-like subscription platform this month.
    But given the fact that the fate of Xbox Series X/S appears to be locked in at
    this point, it’s easy to see why Microsoft is looking at other places it can put
    its games.

    PS5, [dominated the PlayStation Store’s top sellers](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-xbox-has-taken-over-the-sonys-playstation-store)
    list last week on pre-orders alone. CEO Satya Nadella specifically called this
    out during a call with investors, noting that Microsoft had more games in the
    top 25 best sellers on PS5 than any other publisher. “We are committed to meeting
    players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices,”
    he said.'

    hard to imagine Microsoft bringing another batch of its first-party exclusives
    to the rival platform. Whether that means more recent blockbusters like *Starfield*
    or the upcoming *Indiana Jones* game will someday make the journey remains to
    be seen.

    has made it clear it’s not abandoning hardware altogether. Earlier this year,
    [the company promised](https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518)
    its next console would be the “biggest technical leap” yet in its hardware history.
    And Xbox president Sarah Bond recently said the company “[remains committed](https://kotaku.com/xbox-president-game-preservation-backward-compatibility-1851394841)”
    to backwards compatibility and game preservation for players’ current and future
    libraries.
