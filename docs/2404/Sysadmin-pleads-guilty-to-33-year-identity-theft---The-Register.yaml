    and assuming a former coworker's identity over a 33-year period.

- en: According to court documents, Matthew David Keirans, 58, also maliciously worked
    with authorities, supplying them with forged documents that would ultimately see
    his victim jailed and admitted to a mental hospital for nearly a year and a half.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keirans first met his victim, William Donald Woods, who ran away from home at
    16, in "about 1988" – which is as specific as the court documents get – while
    working at a hot dog stand in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Roughly two years later in 1990, Keirans is said to have assumed Woods' identity
    "in every aspect of his life," purchasing all manner of forged documents, including
    a Kentucky birth certificate, US social security number, and I-9 form, all of
    which he later used to secure employment at an Iowa hospital in 2013 as a remote
    sysadmin.

- en: After passing the hospital's background checks, he became a core member of the
    University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics' IT team and assumed a key role in maintaining
    the hospital's systems and infrastructure, according to Keirans' [plea agreement](https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/04/03/usa_v_keirans_plea_memorandum.pdf)
    [PDF].

    was earning more than $100,000 by the time he was nabbed by authorities.

- en: What happened with the real Woods between the late 1980s and the 2010s wasn't
    detailed in the court documents, but we know Keirans secured a job at an unnamed
    fast food chain in 1990 after he got his hands on a fake Colorado ID card. He
    also opened a Colorado bank account using Woods' name and the newfound ID card.

- en: A year later, Keirans bought a car for $600 using two $300 checks, which later
    bounced, drove it a little while until it broke down, and then abandoned it. After,
    he went to an ATM to withdraw all the money he had left, then fled Colorado before
    an arrest warrant for William Woods was issued in the state.

    who also bore Woods' name.

- en: Between August 2016 and May 2022, Keirans took out eight different loans from
    credit unions in Woods' name, amounting to more than $200,000 in value, the court
    documents reveal.

    out in Woods' name – a 2016 Cherokee, a 2019 Cherokee, before ending up in the
    big leagues with a 2018 Grand Cherokee.

    of $11,000, in addition to numerous other personal loans, some of which used his
    Jeep as collateral.

- en: If the awfulness wasn't evident already here, the true malice behind Keirans'
    actions became clear in 2019 when then-homeless Woods discovered the huge debt
    taken in his name, which amounted to around $130,000 at the time, and went to
    his local Los Angeles bank to clear things up.

- en: Trying to explain that the lines of credit weren't taken out by the genuine
    Woods, he requested his account to be closed, saying he refused to pay the debt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the large sums in the account, the real Woods was asked a series of security
    questions, which of course he failed to answer correctly because he didn't create
    them. That prompted the bank teller dealing with Woods to alert the LAPD, which
    arrested Woods after Keirans faxed a series of forged documents to local police,
    "proving" he was the real Woods.

    and California state ID card. To cap it off, Woods was arrested not under his
    own name, but under Keirans' instead.

- en: The worst part – Woods was held in county jail for 428 days in total, and after
    a California judge deemed him mentally unfit to stand trial and Woods pleaded
    "no contest" to the two felony charges against him, he was sent to a mental hospital
    for a total of 147 days and medicated with psychotropic drugs. From then on, the
    judge also ordered Woods to only use his "true name," Matthew Keirans, going forward.

    [sysadmin](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/28/the_death_of_the_sysadmin/)
    gig, was in regular contact with authorities requesting updates to Woods' criminal
    case.

- en: In numerous messages sent between him and the authorities, Keirans was seen
    to be going along with the realities of the case, and at the time Woods' mental
    fitness was questioned, he implied there was a possibility that Woods may regain
    that fitness.

    and spent more than two years filing various reports to convince any authority
    that would listen that he was, in fact, the victim of identity fraud.

    he informed the Iowa hospital about the situation, which then engaged a senior
    detective in the local police force.

    several months, in part using [DNA tests](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/21/dna_testing_company_ftc_complaint/)
    to definitively prove Keirans wasn't the son of an elderly man in Kentucky as
    he had previously claimed.

    to falsely present as Woods until the DNA evidence was presented to him, at which
    point he said "my life is over" and "everything is gone."
