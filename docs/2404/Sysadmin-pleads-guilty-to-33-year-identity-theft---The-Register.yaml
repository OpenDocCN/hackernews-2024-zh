    with authorities, supplying them with forged documents that would ultimately see
    his victim jailed and admitted to a mental hospital for nearly a year and a half.

- en: Keirans first met his victim, William Donald Woods, who ran away from home at
    16, in "about 1988" – which is as specific as the court documents get – while
    working at a hot dog stand in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

    "in every aspect of his life," purchasing all manner of forged documents, including
    a Kentucky birth certificate, US social security number, and I-9 form, all of
    which he later used to secure employment at an Iowa hospital in 2013 as a remote
    sysadmin.

    detailed in the court documents, but we know Keirans secured a job at an unnamed
    fast food chain in 1990 after he got his hands on a fake Colorado ID card. He
    also opened a Colorado bank account using Woods' name and the newfound ID card.

    bounced, drove it a little while until it broke down, and then abandoned it. After,
    he went to an ATM to withdraw all the money he had left, then fled Colorado before
    an arrest warrant for William Woods was issued in the state.

    out in Woods' name – a 2016 Cherokee, a 2019 Cherokee, before ending up in the
    big leagues with a 2018 Grand Cherokee.

    actions became clear in 2019 when then-homeless Woods discovered the huge debt
    taken in his name, which amounted to around $130,000 at the time, and went to
    his local Los Angeles bank to clear things up.

    Woods, he requested his account to be closed, saying he refused to pay the debt.

- en: Given the large sums in the account, the real Woods was asked a series of security
    questions, which of course he failed to answer correctly because he didn't create
    them. That prompted the bank teller dealing with Woods to alert the LAPD, which
    arrested Woods after Keirans faxed a series of forged documents to local police,
    "proving" he was the real Woods.

    and California state ID card. To cap it off, Woods was arrested not under his
    own name, but under Keirans' instead.

    a California judge deemed him mentally unfit to stand trial and Woods pleaded
    "no contest" to the two felony charges against him, he was sent to a mental hospital
    for a total of 147 days and medicated with psychotropic drugs. From then on, the
    judge also ordered Woods to only use his "true name," Matthew Keirans, going forward.

    he informed the Iowa hospital about the situation, which then engaged a senior
    detective in the local police force.

    several months, in part using [DNA tests](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/21/dna_testing_company_ftc_complaint/)
    to definitively prove Keirans wasn't the son of an elderly man in Kentucky as
    he had previously claimed.
