# PHP is Web Shell | Andrew Quinn's TILs

One of the cooler things about working in a firm founded and run by a lot of dyed-in-the-wool Linux hackers like my current place is that there is *a lot* of Bash lying around, accumulated over a good 25 years or so. For all their faults, pure shell solutions still set the silver standard for programs which appear almost entirely immune to bit rot.

But you know what? *So does vanilla PHP.* That pink stuff that was made from the ground up to get you from zero to working dynamic web page as fast as possible.

PHP is Web Shell. I’m convinced of it now.

It sucks. Everyone you know has moved on to bigger and better things. And everyone you don’t know, the other 80% of the Internet, is still using it to get things done, cheaply, reliably, and without fanfare, but with a lot of service contracts, because see the beginning of this paragraph.
