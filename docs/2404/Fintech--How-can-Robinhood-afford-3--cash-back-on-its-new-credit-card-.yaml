    trading — and the [meme stock frenzy](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/27/robinhood-report-meme-stock-gamestop/)
    — entered the credit card space with its new Robinhood Gold Card.

    acquisition of credit card company X1\. [We wrote a detailed piece on this last
    year](https://lex.substack.com/p/fintech-robinhood-acquires-x1-smart); in summary,
    X1, the self-proclaimed “smartest credit card ever made” was a no-fee, rewards-based
    credit card offering a modern digital interface, innovative income-based underwriting,
    and user-friendly features such as easy subscription cancellations and single-use
    virtual cards. It was more “software app” than “card”.

    associated with reward programs and unrecoverable debts. When managed properly,
    credit cards are money-making machines. That said, it's crucial to recognize that
    the income generated is distributed among various stakeholders in the ecosystem.
    The issuer, also known as the issuing bank (e.g., Chase, Citi, Barclays) receives
    the largest share, generally getting the majority of interchange fees and interest
    income, as they are the entities extending the credit. The credit networks (e.g.,
    Visa, Mastercard) receive a smaller portion of the interchange fee. However, as
    networks participate in a significantly higher number of transactions, this really
    adds up — with merchants paying MasterCard and Visa collectively over [$100B in
    2023](https://merchantspaymentscoalition.com/visa-mastercard-credit-card-swipe-fees-hit-record-100-billion-first-time-2023-underscoring-need).

    is not issuing the card directly, instead relying on Coastal Community Bank as
    the issuer. However, unlike how such models typically work, it appears that Robinhood
    will still be underwriting the cards and agreeing to cover certain defaults. With
    that in mind, while the exact revenue share is not disclosed, the nature of the
    relationship likely means that the interchange fees and interest income will be
    split, in some manner, between the two entities.

    active users (MAUs) have been falling since 2021\. The company had over 20 million
    users in 2021, and shows around 10 million in 2023 — a 50% collapse.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, while overall MAUs are declining, Gold Members are increasing, adding
    280K during 2023, and an additional 90K in the first 2 months of 2024\. Recurring
    subscription revenue is the antidote to volatility and might be the most critical
    thing for Robinhood going forward. As discussed by the CFO, Jason Warnick, on
    the company’s 2023 Q4 earning webcast, aside from generating $85MM in annualized
    membership fee revenue, Gold Members adopt products at a higher rate and hold
    approximately 8x the assets, or $40,000, compared to average users.

    to these new members within its ecosystem. The allure of the credit card is likely
    to attract a demographic distinct from the existing Gold Members, which might
    complicate cross-selling efforts. Will the new credit card users bring $40,000
    to the trading platform? Robinhood seems willing to pay 3% cash back for a while
    to test the hypothesis.
