- en: Customs officials in [Hong Kong](https://jalopnik.com/tag/hong-kong) seized
    146 kilograms of gold late last month, worth an estimated $10 million. They discovered
    the gold on [a cargo plane](https://jalopnik.com/beyond-cars/planelopnik) scheduled
    to leave for Japan, and officials now say the value of the seizure makes it the
    biggest gold smuggling case in Hong Kong’s history. What makes this case especially
    interesting, though, is that [Business Insider reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/10-million-gold-disguised-as-machinery-smuggled-plane-hong-kong-2024-4)
    the gold was disguised as machine parts.

- en: On March 27, customs officials x-rayed two air compressors and discovered that
    they contained gold that had been “concealed in the integral parts” of the compressors.
    Those gold parts had also been painted silver to match the other components in
    an attempt to throw customs off the trail.

- en: Acting Senior Superintendent Jason Lau Yuk-lung told [the South China Morning
    Post](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3258206/hong-kong-customs-seizes-precious-metal-disguised-machine-parts-worth-hk84-million-their-biggest)
    that this was the first time customs officials had ever discovered gold disguised
    in this way. Authorities reportedly believe the smuggler went to the lengths he
    did in an effort to avoid Japan’s 10-percent import tariff. “Smugglers could have
    evaded about HK$8.4 million ($1 million) in taxes if the precious metal was successfully
    smuggled into the country,” Lau told the SCMP.

- en: '[In a statement](https://www.customs.gov.hk/en/customs-announcement/press-release/index_id_4147.html?p=1&y=&m=),
    the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department said it had arrested a 31-year-old
    man they believe was behind the cleverly concealed gold they seized. He has since
    been released on bail while authorities continue their investigation. They did
    not release his name, but according to Lau, he was the director of a company in
    Hong Kong that may actually be a shell company. If convicted, the man faces a
    maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine of up to HK$2 million or about
    $255,000 in U.S. dollars.'
