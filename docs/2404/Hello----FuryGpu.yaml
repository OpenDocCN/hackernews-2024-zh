- en: After almost four years of developing a custom full-stack GPU in my spare time,
    I figured it was about time to start putting together some materials to highlight
    the project, its technical details, and its future. This has been my first (and
    only!) FPGA design, and I hope to use this space to share some of what I have
    learned while building this *extremely* complicated piece of hardware.

- en: Throughout the last fourteen years of my career in the games industry (and for
    nearly a decade before in my spare time!) I’ve been focused on the software side
    of rendering - the techniques necessary to utilize the GPU hardware to render
    3D graphics at real-time framerates. While I was extremely familiar with everything
    involved in this process on the host side, the actual details of how the hardware
    that performed these actions was built was not something I had ever had access
    to. After putting together Ben Eater’s [8-bit breadboard compute](https://eater.net/8bit)r
    and then picking up an [Arty Z7](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-z7-zynq-7000-soc-development-board/)
    development board on a whim, I realized that building a GPU from scratch, while
    a massive and daunting project, was something I certainly could teach myself to
    do. I’d spend a few months making a spinning cube or something, and be done with
    it.

- en: Nearly four years later and the project has turned from a neat little tech demo
    idea into a fully-fledged, real-world, plug-it-into-your-computer GPU. I taught
    myself SystemVerilog, figured out how FPGAs work, and spent countless hours refactoring,
    redesigning, and streamlining the design until I could get Quake to render at
    semi-real-time framerates. During this time, Xilinx released their [Kria SoMs](https://www.amd.com/en/products/system-on-modules/kria.html)
    - insanely cheap Zynq UltraScale+ FPGAs with a ton of DSP units and a (comparatively)
    massive amount of LUTs and FFs, and of particular interest, a hardened PCIe core.
    The next step was clear - this GPU needed to become a *real* GPU. One I could
    plug into my computer and use to play real games.

- en: Designing the schematic for and laying out a PCIe graphics card, even with much
    of the FPGA circuitry built into the SOM, was a herculean effort. However, I’d
    already spent several years on the project, so why not? After several months of
    work laying out the board in KiCad and fixing all the issues I’d find as soon
    as JLCPCB delivered each revision, I finally had a board with a powerful FPGA,
    DisplayPort and HDMI output, and a 4-lane PCIe connector that I could plug into
    my test rig and write drivers for.

- en: Of all the parts of this project, writing Windows drivers for it have been *the
    most* painful. Eventually, I got everything working. I wrote a custom graphics
    API to communicate with the GPU, wrote Windows kernel drivers for the display
    and audio, and now have a fully-functional piece of graphics hardware that can
    render Quake at a solid 60 frames per second.

  zh: 在这个项目的所有部分中，为它编写Windows驱动程序是*最*痛苦的。最终，我解决了所有问题。我编写了一个自定义的图形API来与GPU通信，为显示和音频编写了Windows内核驱动程序，现在拥有一个可以以稳定的60帧每秒渲染《奇兵》的完全功能的图形硬件。
- en: While I’m writing all of this after the fact, I do hope that some of what I
    eventually detail here will prove useful (or at least, interesting) to the next
    person that decides to embark on such a ridiculous journey.
