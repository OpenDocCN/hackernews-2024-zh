- en: A wireless, chipless prototype biosensor offers the prospect of simple, wearable
    tech that can continuously monitor blood-sugar levels and other biochemical and
    physiological markers. The system pairs an implanted, magnetic biosensor with
    a miniature, wearable device that relays the sensor’s magnetic signals to a smartphone
    via Bluetooth.

    covered with a thin, flexible membrane, on which is glued a minuscule magnet.
    The wearable reader is a magnetic-signal transmitter-receiver about the size of
    a stack of three or four American [Kennedy half-dollars](https://catalog.usmint.gov/coins/coin-programs/kennedy-half-dollars/)
    or [EU 10-euro collector coins](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/tasks/cash-management/euro-coins/collector-coins/10-euro-828912).

    as the miniaturized wearable device,” says [Mengdi Han](https://future.pku.edu.cn/en/js/Faculty/DeptBME/41fab12c423d43d4b080d5b7737b5433.htm),

    (TMR) sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance), which picks
    up the motions of the implanted magnet and sends the signal via Bluetooth to a
    handheld device, where it is recorded and decoded.

    a variation of magnetic field, enabling us to use a mini wearable device to measure
    the signal continuously at any place.”

    implant, but then realized that a simple cavity was more reliable.”

    from earlier work on magnetoelastic resonance sensors. “Our work indeed builds
    upon the foundation laid by previous research in magnetoelastic resonance sensors,”

    gluing vertical arrays of multiwalled carbon nanotubes to its exposed surface.
    They then coated the nanotubes with proteins that grab onto the molecules they
    want to detect, increasing the inertia of the vibrating surface.

    a bean protein with a strong affinity for sugar molecules, produced a glucose
    sensor. Coating with specific antibodies produced real-time sensors for proteins
    like [albumin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25518870/) and [human immunoglobulin
    G](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00028).

    an elastic membrane as the vibration structure,” Han says. “The resulting vibration
    amplitudes reach millimeter-level, two orders of magnitude larger than conventional
    [MEMS actuators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838232/). Such
    large amplitudes create obvious variations of magnetic field. Therefore, we can
    detect the change of magnetic field using sensors even with relatively low sensitivities,
    such as the TMR sensor chip integrated in our miniaturized wearable device.”

    more sophisticated and expensive receivers, says Han.

    field, or use lock-in electronics,” he adds. Some devices even demand expensive
    and bulky superconducting quantum interference device magnetometers ([SQUIDs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-new-hypersensitive-magnetometer-based-on-kinetic-inductance))

    says. “However, I do think that our wearable reader can be at least 10 times cheaper
    than earlier bulky readout equipment.”

    device. “There is a demand for wireless implantable sensors in various clinical

    postimplantation.”
