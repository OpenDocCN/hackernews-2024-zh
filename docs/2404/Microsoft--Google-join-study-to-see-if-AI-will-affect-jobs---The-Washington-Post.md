As artificial intelligence continues to envelop the tech industry, debates about how it will affect workers and the economy are ramping up. Big Tech companies that are investing heavily in the technology, including Google and Microsoft, are forming a group to study how AI might affect technology jobs.

The group, led by telecommunications equipment maker Cisco, also includes IBM, chip maker Intel, business software company SAP and tech consultant Accenture. Unions including the AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) are listed as “advisors” to the group.
