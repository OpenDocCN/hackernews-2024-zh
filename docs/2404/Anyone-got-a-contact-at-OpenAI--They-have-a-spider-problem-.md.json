["```\nAs I think I have mentioned before, I have the world's lamest content farm\nat https://www.web.sp.am/.  Click on a link or two and you'll get the idea.\n\nUnfortunately, GPTBot has found it and has not gotten the idea. It has\nfetched over 3 million pages today. Before someone tells me to fix my\nrobots.txt, this is a content farm so rather than being one web site\nwith 6,859,000,000 pages, it is 6,859,000,000 web sites each with one\npage. Of those 3 million page fetches, 1.8 million were for robots.txt.\n\nIt's not like it's hard to figure out what's going on since the pages\nall look nearly the same, and they're all on the same IP address with\nthe same wildcard SSL certificate.\n\nAmazon's spider got stuck there a month or two ago but fortunately I was\nable to find someone to pass the word and it stopped.  Got any contacts\nat OpenAI?\n\nR's,\nJohn\n\nPS: If you were wondering what they're using to train GPT-5, well, now you know.\n\n```"]
