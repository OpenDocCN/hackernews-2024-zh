- en: You see, there’s more than one way that people expect type-to-search to work.
    In one pattern, you type the first letter of the thing you want, and the system
    finds the first item that starts with that letter. If that’s not the one you want,
    you press that same letter again, and the system finds the second item that starts
    with that letter. Keep pressing that same letter until you get to the item you
    want. This is how list box searching worked in Windows 1.0.

- en: Another pattern is to type the first letter of the thing you want, and the system
    finds the first item that starts with that letter. If that’s not the one you want,
    then type the second letter of the thing you want, and the system finds the first
    item whose first two letters match the letters you typed. Keep typing more and
    more letters until you get to the item you want.

- en: If you type the same letter over and over again, then the classic Win32 ListView
    assumes that you are using the first pattern, and each time you press the same
    letter again, it selects the next item that starts with that letter. But if you
    type different letters, then the classic Win32 ListView assumes that you are typing
    a prefix, and it selects the first item that starts with that prefix.

    with L.
  id: totrans-split-20

- en: You type another L. Since this is now two L’s, the Win32 ListView is in “repeated
    letter” mode, and it selects the second L-animal, which is *Lemur*.

- en: Now you type A. This is no longer a repeat of the same letter, so the Win32
    ListView switches to “prefix” mode, and it selects the first item which begins
    with “LLA”, which is *Llama*.
