Intro chat with Recruiter to share what we are building and learn about your interests. We are searching for creativity, enthusiasm, and ownership. (30 mins)

Meeting with CEO (45-60 mins)

Offer decision time!

The typical interview process takes 2-4 weeks from start to finish. This tends to be mostly based on our eng team’s availability. That said, we have moved more quickly and look to accommodate candidates who might have a short timeline or competing offers. The more information you can share about your situation and where you are in the process, the more we can either attempt to expedite/match, or save you time if we cannot.

Chariot is a payment network for the $229B+ in Donor Advised Funds. We build the financial infrastructure that connects these complex charitable assets to nonprofits. Chariot is doing for charitable transactions what Visa did for the entire banking industry in the 1950s. Every line of code pushed helps move millions of dollars to charity.

We are currently backed by Y Combinator, Spark Capital, SV Angel, and top-tier angel investors like Adam Grant, Adam Nash, and Angela Duckworth.

DAFs hold $229B+ in charitable assets and are the fastest-growing vehicle in philanthropy. However, millions of DAF users are stuck behind archaic login portals, emails, or even phone calls to make a donation.

Imagine you had to send a wire transfer to Nike every time you wanted to buy a pair of new shoes. How much less likely would you be to get those sneakers? Today, that’s what it’s like to donate with a DAF. It is estimated that this current friction represents $395B in unrealized donations over the next decade. Chariot’s easy-to-use payment option reduces the DAF donation process to just a few clicks.

If what we're doing speaks to you, we’d be thrilled to meet. Come join our core team and build the future of philanthropy.
