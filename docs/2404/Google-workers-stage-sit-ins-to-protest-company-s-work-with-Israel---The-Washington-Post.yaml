    company’s offices in New York City and Sunnyvale, Calif., after staging sit-ins
    to protest the tech giant’s work with the Israeli government, escalating the conflict
    inside tech companies over the [war in Gaza](https://www.washingtonpost.com/israel-hamas-war/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2)
    and whether U.S. companies should selltheir technology to Israel.
