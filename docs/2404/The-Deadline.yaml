    had bought it quite some time ago, but it collected dust on the shelf, despite
    the fact that I had enjoyed his book “Peopleware”. Turns out, it was a mistake.
    The collecting dust, not the reading, mind you.'

    tight deadlines) in each chapter, usually with a new character who is relevant
    to the issue at hand. This new character is often a world-renowned expert on this
    field, is flown in (or visited) and gives key insight in an afternoon. Obviously,
    this repeating theme is one of the reasons why the book falls short as a novel
    per se.

    but are channelling Tom DeMarco’s convictions. That’s perfectly okay, since it’s
    Tom DeMarco’s presentation, but the reader must not get confused, for the characters
    in the book take every word of those experts as gospel, never questioning it,
    never finding tensions or direct contradictions to other experts’ views. The reader
    must not get complacent and do the same.

    And there are quite a few real nuggets in there. They are never too detailed,
    more food-for-thought. I like that because it saves the book from becoming the
    chore most project management books are. Remember, no proofs for the validity
    are given, this is straight advice by the author. Take it or leave it.

    like to repeat some others here. Some of them are important and had at least some
    quality of being new to me. Some were nothing new, but spoke to me because I have
    personal recollections pertinent to them. Others just elicited some thoughts of
    my own that I don’t want to lose. So instead of re-reading the book later, I hope
    those notes can serve as a reminder of the meat of it, as I saw it.

    the identity of the penitent (realistically, I think, there are only so many people
    with both the knowledge of some subject and no better way to report it), but never
    lets it show. That is probably important, because as soon as the higher-up breaks
    this illusion of anonymity reports will dry up.

    with managing risks, there should be a designated risk officer. Furthermore, this
    risk officer (aided by the team, of course) must identify early indicators of
    important risks well before they can materialize, and then be on a constant lookout
    for those indicators.

    making it okay to eliminate those time-killers. For example, a boss once instituted
    the policy that team members were explicitly allowed to declare times of the day
    where they don’t respond to the telephone (and announce those times), as well
    as put up a do-not-disturb sign at their desk in the open-plan office. The effects
    weren’t too big, in my recollection, mostly because those were inadequate means
    of addressing the root cause.

    new software industry explicitly model their “hunches” or gut feelings about how
    much of an effect training and personnel fluctuations have on the work being completed.
    This means not just drawing diagrams, but actually using a modelling tool on the
    computer and quantifying the internal state transitions.

    lingering doubts as to its practicality, not only the quantitative part, but also
    the ability to conjure up a semi-realistic model in the first place, but it looks
    like there are actually tools for that purpose being sold and used.

    in specifications are not because of conflicts without a resolution, but because
    of missing information. Why can’t the author just ask around until he knows the
    answer? Often because decisions pertinent to the issue haven’t been made, yet,
    and are some other group’s responsibility. In a way you can call it a scheduling
    conflict, I suppose, but I wouldn’t really sort it under the heading “conflict”.

    subjects nobody in the company knew anymore why certain directions were taken.
    No one left to ask.
