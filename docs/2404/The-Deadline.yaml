- en: '**The Deadline** by **Tom DeMarco** is a real project management classic. I
    had bought it quite some time ago, but it collected dust on the shelf, despite
    the fact that I had enjoyed his book “Peopleware”. Turns out, it was a mistake.
    The collecting dust, not the reading, mind you.'

    is pleasant to read, even funny at times, as a novel it’s not worth a lot. But
    this clever packaging makes it so much easier to plow through.

- en: Our protagonist, a project manager that recently lost his job because he spoke
    his mind, is drugged and kidnapped by a charming young woman who is “acquiring”
    talent for the up-and-coming software industry of Monrovia, a fictional country
    of the former Eastern Bloc.

    to become the biggest software supplier of the world. Six software products have
    already been planned (all rip-offs of well-selling programs like Photoshop), and
    now it’s time to execute on that vision.

- en: The novel introduces a problem (like personal conflicts between developers or
    tight deadlines) in each chapter, usually with a new character who is relevant
    to the issue at hand. This new character is often a world-renowned expert on this
    field, is flown in (or visited) and gives key insight in an afternoon. Obviously,
    this repeating theme is one of the reasons why the book falls short as a novel
    per se.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reader needs to be acutely aware that those experts are no real-world experts,
    but are channelling Tom DeMarco’s convictions. That’s perfectly okay, since it’s
    Tom DeMarco’s presentation, but the reader must not get confused, for the characters
    in the book take every word of those experts as gospel, never questioning it,
    never finding tensions or direct contradictions to other experts’ views. The reader
    must not get complacent and do the same.

- en: Every chapter ends with a few short notes on what our protagonist has learned.
    And there are quite a few real nuggets in there. They are never too detailed,
    more food-for-thought. I like that because it saves the book from becoming the
    chore most project management books are. Remember, no proofs for the validity
    are given, this is straight advice by the author. Take it or leave it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While most of those points were pretty obvious, sometimes even trivial, I’d
    like to repeat some others here. Some of them are important and had at least some
    quality of being new to me. Some were nothing new, but spoke to me because I have
    personal recollections pertinent to them. Others just elicited some thoughts of
    my own that I don’t want to lose. So instead of re-reading the book later, I hope
    those notes can serve as a reminder of the meat of it, as I saw it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the early lessons is that there should be an anonymous way to report
    problems up the hierarchy. In the novel it is presented as a real confessional
    box, complete with the ceremony based on the catholic shrift.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, this mechanism is not limited to reporting own failures and problems.
    Actually, it’s more likely that it will lead to reports about problems in areas
    the reporter doesn’t have under his control, I think.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One interesting twist is that the confessor in the novel always knows very well
    the identity of the penitent (realistically, I think, there are only so many people
    with both the knowledge of some subject and no better way to report it), but never
    lets it show. That is probably important, because as soon as the higher-up breaks
    this illusion of anonymity reports will dry up.

    with managing risks, there should be a designated risk officer. Furthermore, this
    risk officer (aided by the team, of course) must identify early indicators of
    important risks well before they can materialize, and then be on a constant lookout
    for those indicators.

    every sane team member handles those low-hanging fruit on his own, in order to
    eliminate sources of frustration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This may be an exaggeration, I think, because sometimes management can help
    making it okay to eliminate those time-killers. For example, a boss once instituted
    the policy that team members were explicitly allowed to declare times of the day
    where they don’t respond to the telephone (and announce those times), as well
    as put up a do-not-disturb sign at their desk in the open-plan office. The effects
    weren’t too big, in my recollection, mostly because those were inadequate means
    of addressing the root cause.

- en: In a very interesting early chapter the senior management of Monrovia’s budding
    new software industry explicitly model their “hunches” or gut feelings about how
    much of an effect training and personnel fluctuations have on the work being completed.
    This means not just drawing diagrams, but actually using a modelling tool on the
    computer and quantifying the internal state transitions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This serves not only as a tool to communicate one’s hunches to other members
    of the management team, and consequently to compare and refine those hunches.
    It also allows to plug in real-life measurements, thus improving one’s understanding
    of the effects at work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was probably the single most surprising lesson in the book for me. I have
    lingering doubts as to its practicality, not only the quantitative part, but also
    the ability to conjure up a semi-realistic model in the first place, but it looks
    like there are actually tools for that purpose being sold and used.

    It is not a viable means to do that. But pressure, applied judiciously and for

    It is therefore not bad by itself, but it is usually applied in a destructive
    way (non-focussed: too much for too long).'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s an insight that was new to me. Still, I think that lots of ambiguities
    in specifications are not because of conflicts without a resolution, but because
    of missing information. Why can’t the author just ask around until he knows the
    answer? Often because decisions pertinent to the issue haven’t been made, yet,
    and are some other group’s responsibility. In a way you can call it a scheduling
    conflict, I suppose, but I wouldn’t really sort it under the heading “conflict”.

    the beginning. The small design team was furiously cranking out specifications
    for the (dozen or so) fully staffed teams to work on, but they were hopelessly
    swamped, of course. So the teams mostly sat on their hands.
  prefs: []

    So many decisions were not only ingrained into the design (and the source code!),
    but also a kind of folklore. The original design team had moved on, and on some
    subjects nobody in the company knew anymore why certain directions were taken.
    No one left to ask.
