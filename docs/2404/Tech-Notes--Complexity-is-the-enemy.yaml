    things there, more than I could ever write down. I thought I would at least share
    with you something that's only come to me with more experience.

- en: 'Complexity is the death of software. It''s hard to quantify the cost of, and
    it tends to creep in slowly, so it''s a slow boil of getting worse that''s hard
    to see until it''s too late. On the other side, frequently it''s easy to see a
    benefit of increasing complexity: a new layer of indirection allows new feature
    X, or splitting a process that ran on one machine into two allows you to surmount
    your current scaling hurdle. But now you must keep another layer of indirection
    in your head, or implement an RPC layer and manage two machines.'

    What I think I''ve learned through my few years in the industry is a better understanding
    of how the balance works out; when complexity is warranted and when it should
    be rejected. I frequently think back to a friend''s comment on the [Go compiler](http://golang.org/)
    written by [Ken Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson): it''s fast
    because it just doesn''t do much, the code is very straightforward.'

    to make the same point succinctly, it's difficult to write software that is straightforward.
    This is easiest to see in programming langauge design; new languages by novices
    tend to have lots of features, while few have the crisp clarity of C. In today's
    programs it's frequently related to how many objects are involved; in distributed
    systems it's about how many moving parts there are.

    hackers, "Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore,
    if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart
    enough to debug it."'

    by one too many projects where someone thought metaprogramming was cool. But I''ve
    found having specific design goals to evaluate new code by can help. It''s easier
    to reject new code if you can say "this does not help solve the initial goals
    of the project". Within Google the template document for describing the design
    of a new project has a section right at the top to list *non-goals*: reasonable
    extensions of the project that you intend to reject.'

    It''s hard to write a complicated C program because it can''t do very much. C
    programs tend to use lots of arrays because that''s all you get, but it turns
    out that arrays are great — compact memory representation, O(1) access, good data
    locality. I''d never advocate intentionally using a weak tool, though. Instead,
    my lesson has been: write Python code like it was C.'
