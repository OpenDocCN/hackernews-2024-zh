- en: Builders have officially broken ground on a new $12 billion train that could
    zoom travelers between Las Vegas and Los Angeles in just under two hours by the
    end of the decade. The new train, which is considered the first “high-speed” rail
    in the United States, could cut down commute time for travelers and reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions that would otherwise be emitted from cars and planes. Brightline,
    the firm responsible for the project, received $3 billion in support from the
    federal government as part of the 2021 bipartisan Infrastructure law.

    the moment as a “major milestone in building the future of American rail.” The
    ceremony symbolically took place on Earth Day.

    in our country’s transportation story that includes thousands of union jobs, new
    connections to better economic opportunity, less congestion on the roads, and
    less pollution in the air,” Buttigieg said in a [statement](https://www.gobrightline.com/press-room/2024/brightline-west-breaks-ground-on-americas-first-high-speed-rail-project-connecting-las-vegas-to-southern-california).

    of the Vegas strip and another one in the LA suburb of Rancho Cucamonga. When
    it’s completed, the train will travel at 186 miles per hour, making it the fastest
    train in the US and comparable to Japan’s famous bullet trains. For context, Brightline’s
    most recently completed train connecting parts of Florida is estimated to [top
    out around 130 miles per hour](https://www.gobrightline.com/press-room/2023/brightline-130-mph-milestone).
    Both of those still fall far short of the speed achieved by the world fastest
    commuter train in Shanghai, which can [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-fastest-trains-cmd/index.html#)
    reach a speed of 286 miles per hour. Still, the new train could complete the 218
    mile trip between Sin City and a suburb of the City of Angels in just 2 hours
    and 10 minutes. That same trip would take about four hours by car, and that’s
    without substantial traffic.

    food and drinks available for purchase. Brightline hasn’t provided an exact price
    for how much an individual train ticket will cost but has instead said they expect
    it to be roughly equivalent to the price of an airline flight. Brightline [reportedly](https://apnews.com/article/595913ff2fa3d9001fb89bfab4e6c4d2)
    believes the train could attract 11 million one-way passengers annually once it’s
    up and running.

    the new train could cut back 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year and create
    35,000 new jobs. It could also help foster new, much-needed competition. Amtrak,
    the nation’s primary long distance rail provider, has long held a monopoly over
    long distance rail in the US, but many areas still remain unserved. Prior to this
    project, Las Vegas, for example, did not have Amtrak service. Brightline is looking
    to build out more trains in the coming decade, with a focus on connecting areas
    that commuters find too close to fly and too far to comfortably drive.

    But there are signs the country’s attitude toward rails is beginning to change.
    Brightline, the same company attempting to link Las Vegas and LA, recently completed
    a first-of-its-kind train linking Miami, Aventura, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton,
    and West Palm Beach in Florida. Brightline [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/04/20/high-speed-rail-construction-california-las-vegas/)
    claims its Florida train had 258,307 passengers in March.

    the Pacific Northwest and other parts of California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/08/30/us-high-speed-rail-projects/).
    Those efforts, if they materialize, will be made possible in part by billions
    of dollars worth of grants set aside for rail as part of the infrastructure law.
    Still, receiving funds and beginning projects are only the beginning of the battle.
    Rising costs and routing disputes can delay and complicate and delay actual development.
    One proposed rail line running roughly 300 miles between San Francisco and LA
    was first [approved by voters in 2008 and has still yet to materialize](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/us/california-high-speed-rail-politics.html).
    As of today, nearly two decades later, [less than a quarter](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-03-21/high-speed-rail)
    of that rail line has been completed. Brightline is hoping it can avoid those
    complications with its new high-speed rail. If it does, commuters could expect
    to make the trip between Sin City and Hollywood by 2028.
