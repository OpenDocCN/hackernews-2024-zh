- en: Security researchers Can Yoleri, Murat Özfidan and Egemen Koçhisarlı with SOCRadar,
    a cybersecurity company that helps organizations find security weaknesses, discovered
    an open and public storage server hosted on Microsoft’s Azure cloud service that
    was storing internal information relating to Microsoft’s Bing search engine.

    passwords, keys and credentials used by the Microsoft employees for accessing
    other internal databases and systems.

    accessed by anyone on the internet.

- en: Yoleri told TechCrunch that the exposed data could potentially help malicious
    actors identify or access other places where Microsoft stores its internal files.
    Identifying those storage locations “could result in more significant data leaks
    and possibly compromise the services in use,” Yoleri said.

    by the time of publication. In a statement shared after publication on Wednesday,
    Microsoft’s Jeff Jones told TechCrunch: “Though the credentials should not have
    been exposed, they were temporary, accessible only from internal networks, and
    disabled after testing. We thank our partners for responsibly reporting this issue.”'

    trust with its customers after a series of cloud security incidents in recent
    years. In a similar security lapse last year, researchers found that [Microsoft
    employees were exposing their own corporate network logins](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gb43/microsoft-employees-exposed-login-credentials-azure-github)

    that allowed the hackers broad access to Microsoft-hosted inboxes of senior U.S.
    government officials. An independent board of cyber experts tasked with investigating
    the email breach wrote in their report, published last week, that the hackers
    succeeded because of a “cascade of security failures at Microsoft.”
