- en: Since the pre-release at the 2023 Summit, we have made significant improvements
    to the networking sub-system, generally rationalising interfaces and further improving
    performance, the Ethernet device-class interfaces are now mature. We have also
    introduced preliminary specs and prototype implementations for serial, I2C, block,
    audio and graphics device classes.
