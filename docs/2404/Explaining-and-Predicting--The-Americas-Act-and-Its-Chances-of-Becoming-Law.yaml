    pressure mounts on Washington to renew its commitment to the region, cosponsors
    from both sides of the aisle introduced [the “Americas Trade and Investment Act”
    or “Americas Act”](https://files.constantcontact.com/1849eea4801/a3ba98de-96e6-4b69-8d0d-82d86ba51f28.pdf).
    Sponsored by Senators Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) and Michael Bennet (D-Colorado)
    and House members Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Florida) and Adriano Espaillat (D-New
    York), the Americas Act seeks to create a partnership to increase trade and prosperity
    a well as counter China’s growing influence in the region. In this explainer we
    examine the Americas Act, its key provisions and impact for the region, and the
    prospects for its passage.

    partnerships to stimulate growth and integration through viable long-term private
    sector development. Intended, in the first instance, for Americas Partnership
    for Economic Prosperity (APEP) member states (Barbados, Canada, Chile, Colombia,
    Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay), the
    bill establishes a set of guiding principles on democratic governance, trade,
    and rule of law. Benefits for participating countries include better access to
    the U.S. market, loans and grants to near-shoring industries from China, targeted
    programs to increase the competitiveness of strategic regional supply chains,

- en: The bill stands out for three reasons. First, it represents the most comprehensive
    U.S. policy attempt to deepen relations with the Western Hemisphere in more than
    two decades. Following the collapse of the negotiations to create the Free Trade
    Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2003, [successive U.S. administrations opted for
    negotiating](https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/the-new-multilateralism/multilateralism-in-the-americas)
    less comprehensive bilateral trade deals. The Americas Act marks a return to policies
    inspired by deeply rooted hemispheric values of regional integration, cooperation,
    trade, and democracy promotion. Expectations are high. Historically, the [most
    effective U.S. policies towards the region](https://www.cc-latam.org/the-message-matters),
    such as President Franklin Delano Roosvelt’s Good Neighbor policy and President
    Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, contained a strong pan-American integration component.

    the hemisphere. Coincidentally, just as the U.S. moved away from broader regional
    integration plans two decades ago, China’s economic ties with the Latin American
    and the Caribbean region [began to grow exponentially](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri).
    Today, China has surpassed the U.S. as Latin America’s largest trading partner.
    The Americas Act comes amid mounting concerns about Washington’s lack of strategic
    vision for its role within its traditional sphere of influence. From securing
    the critical minerals supply chains to investments on infrastructure and the introduction
    of telecommunications technology, the region has become a decisive battleground
    in the great power struggle between the United States and China.

    such as expanding free trade represents a significant step forward. After four
    decades negotiating free trade agreements, the election of president Donald Trump
    in 2016 marked a turning point for trade liberalization for the United States.
    Ever since, despite renegotiating NAFTA (today USMCA) in 2020, [Democrats and
    Republicans alike backed away](https://thehill.com/business/4222035-how-trump-and-biden-killed-the-free-trade-consensus/)
    from major trade negotiations including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and EU-U.S.
    trade talks. The Americas Act could signify a step towards returning to trade
    liberalization as a [tool to increase geopolitical influence](https://hbr.org/2016/04/americas-uneasy-history-with-free-trade).
