- en: Following in-depth evaluation and collaborative discussions, Netgate today announces
    a significant strategic shift in the technological foundation of the pfSense project.
    We are excited to reveal plans for the migration of the pfSense platform from
    the FreeBSD operating system to a Linux kernel with a FreeBSD userland.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This decision arises from a comprehensive analysis that carefully considered
    the evolving landscape of network security and the ever-growing needs of the pfSense
    community. While FreeBSD has served the pfSense project exceptionally well for
    nearly 20 years, the limitations inherent in its ecosystem necessitate a move
    towards a more dynamic and future-proof platform. The advantages offered by a
    Linux base present compelling opportunities for continued growth and advancement.

    set of essential tools that cater to a broad range of network security needs.
    However, the Linux ecosystem boasts a vast universe of readily available software
    packages. This transition unlocks a whole new level of customization and flexibility
    for users. Network administrators will have the ability to tailor pfSense to address
    highly specialized needs and integrate specific functionalities seamlessly into
    their security environment.'

    enterprise storage platform to Linux](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/18/truenas_abandons_freebsd/).
    Both FreeNAS (which has becomeTrueNAS) and pfSense originally [forked from m0n0wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueNAS)
    over 20 years ago. While TrueNAS and pfSense software are focused on different
    market segments, by leveraging the vast potential of the Linux ecosystem, both
    pfSense and [TrueNAS are positioned for continued innovation and a brighter future](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/what-is-the-future-of-truenas-core.116049/page-2#post-804807).
