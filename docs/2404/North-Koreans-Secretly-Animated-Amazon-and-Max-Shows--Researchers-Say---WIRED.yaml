    were also files and projects the researchers could not identify—including a “bunch
    of files” with videos of horses and a Russian book on horses, Williams says.

- en: Sanctions placed upon the North Korean regime, for its ongoing human rights
    abuses and nuclear warfare programs, prohibit US companies from working with DPRK
    companies or individuals. However, the researchers say it is highly unlikely that
    any companies involved would have a clue about North Korean animators working
    on the shows, and there is nothing suggesting the companies violated any sanctions
    or other laws. “It is likely that the contracting arrangement was several steps
    downstream from the major producers,” the report says.

- en: Williams says it is possible that a front company in China is used to help disguise
    the activity and involvement of North Koreans. The researchers were able to analyze
    connections to the exposed server and, despite most having their location masked
    by a VPN, spotted access from Spain and three Chinese cities. “All three cities
    are known to have many North Korean–operated businesses and are main centers for
    North Korea’s IT workers who live overseas,” the report says.

    Korean organizations buried in the files, the country has a well-established animation
    company called April 26 Animation Studio, which is also known as [SEK Studio](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-02-24/inside-north-korea-s-april-26th-animation-studios).

    individuals linked to it, and various “front companies” that it says are used
    to “work for foreign customers.” Many of these have links to China, according
    to the sanctions. “SEK Studio has utilized an assortment of front companies to
    evade sanctions targeting the government of the DPRK and to deceive international
    financial institutions,” a statement issued as part of the [sanctions in 2021

- en: The main aim of these efforts, says Michael Barnhart, a North Korea researcher
    at Mandiant, is to raise money for the North Korean regime. The country’s hackers
    and scammers have stolen and extorted billions of dollars to help fund its military
    ambitions in recent years, including from [huge cryptocurrency heists](https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hackers-apt38-cryptocurrency/).
    In early 2022, the [FBI issued a 16-page alert](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Awired.com+north+korea+tech+worker&sca_esv=09379ecd0b6efd91&sca_upv=1&source=hp&ei=5LgiZuj3KN2FhbIP4NqBwAs&iflsig=ANes7DEAAAAAZiLG9E11g7asfMT9qUekpRp4gjbrAy1U&ved=0ahUKEwjo-fyN9c6FAxXdQkEAHWBtALgQ4dUDCBc&uact=5&oq=site%3Awired.com+north+korea+tech+worker&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IiZzaXRlOndpcmVkLmNvbSBub3J0aCBrb3JlYSB0ZWNoIHdvcmtlcki7PFAAWJ88cAV4AJABAJgBW6AB5BaqAQI0N7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCEqACiwmoAgrCAgsQLhiABBixAxiDAcICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAgUQLhiABMICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgUQABiABMICERAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGIMBGMcBwgIOEC4YgAQY0QMY1AIYxwHCAgoQABiABBixAxgKwgIHEAAYgAQYCsICBxAAGIAEGA3CAhAQABgDGOUCGOoCGIwDGI8BwgIQEC4YAxjlAhjqAhiMAxiPAcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGMcBwgIOEC4YgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAgsQLhiABBjRAxjHAcICDhAuGIAEGMcBGI4FGK8BmAMCkgcCMTigB_2aAQ&sclient=gws-wiz)

  zh: 曼迪安特的朝鲜研究员迈克尔·巴恩哈特说，这些努力的主要目的是为朝鲜政权筹集资金。近年来，该国的黑客和诈骗分子通过从[大规模加密货币盗窃案](https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hackers-apt38-cryptocurrency/)中窃取和勒索数十亿美元，帮助资助其军事野心。2022年初，[FBI发布了一份16页的警报](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Awired.com+north+korea+tech+worker&sca_esv=09379ecd0b6efd91&sca_upv=1&source=hp&ei=5LgiZuj3KN2FhbIP4NqBwAs&iflsig=ANes7DEAAAAAZiLG9E11g7asfMT9qUekpRp4gjbrAy1U&ved=0ahUKEwjo-fyN9c6FAxXdQkEAHWBtALgQ4dUDCBc&uact=5&oq=site%3Awired.com+north+korea+tech+worker&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IiZzaXRlOndpcmVkLmNvbSBub3J0aCBrb3JlYSB0ZWNoIHdvcmtlcki7PFAAWJ88cAV4AJABAJgBW6AB5BaqAQI0N7gBA8gBAPgBAZgCEqACiwmoAgrCAgsQLhiABBixAxiDAcICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIOEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAgUQLhiABMICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgUQABiABMICERAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGIMBGMcBwgIOEC4YgAQY0QMY1AIYxwHCAgoQABiABBixAxgKwgIHEAAYgAQYCsICBxAAGIAEGA3CAhAQABgDGOUCGOoCGIwDGI8BwgIQEC4YAxjlAhjqAhiMAxiPAcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGMcBwgIOEC4YgAQYsQMYgwEYigXCAgsQLhiABBjRAxjHAcICDhAuGIAEGMcBGI4FGK8BmAMCkgcCMTigB_2aAQ&sclient=gws-wiz)警告公司，称朝鲜远程自由职业IT工作者正在渗透企业，以赚取能够汇回家乡的资金。
- en: “The volume is much higher than we were expecting,” Barnhart says of North Korea’s
    IT workers. They are constantly changing their tactics to avoid being caught,
    he says. “We had one not too long ago, where during the interview, the person’s
    mouth was just off-frame. You could tell that someone in the background was speaking
    on their behalf.” Technically, Barnhart says, companies should verify their remote
    workers’ devices and make sure that there is no remote software connecting to
    a company laptop or network. Businesses should also put extra efforts at the hiring
    stage by training HR staff to detect possible IT workers.

  zh: “我们的预期远远没有达到的数量。”巴恩哈特谈到朝鲜的IT工作者时说。他说，他们不断改变策略以避免被捕。“不久前，我们有一个案例，在面试过程中，这个人的嘴巴刚好超出画面之外。你可以看出后台有人在代表他说话。”技术上讲，巴恩哈特说，公司应该验证远程工作者的设备，并确保公司笔记本电脑或网络没有远程软件连接。企业还应在招聘阶段加倍努力，培训人力资源人员以发现可能的IT工作者。
- en: However, he says, increasingly there is a greater crossover between North Korean
    IT workers and individuals who are members of known hacking groups or classified
    as advanced persistent threats (APTs). “The more we focus on IT workers, the more
    we’re starting to see APT operators and efforts blending in with those,” he says.
    “This might be the most quick learning-on-your-feet, nimble nation-state that
    I've ever seen.”
