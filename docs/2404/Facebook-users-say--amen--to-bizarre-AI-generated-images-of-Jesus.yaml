- en: The vast majority of the synthetic images do not indicate in the posts or on
    the pages that they are AI-generated, even though Meta [requires users](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/02/labeling-ai-generated-images-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/)
    to label AI-generated content on its platforms while it is working toward methods
    to automatically detect such content.

    and outright disinformation, information researchers have grown increasingly concerned
    about the implications of unchecked AI images’ flooding social platforms.

- en: Though certain hallmarks of AI-generated art can make it easier to tell real
    images from synthetic ones, the lack of systematic labeling has some users — [especially
    older ones](https://iapp.org/news/a/older-americans-are-becoming-more-prone-to-ai-cyber-scams/)
    — falling for falsified content, according to comments on many of the posts. Those
    Facebook pages have not exhibited clear motives for their AI spam, but users are
    already pointing out the potential of a scam operation.

- en: The Stanford study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that some
    of the images have been posted from Facebook pages that were stolen from other
    people or organizations, including a church in Georgia and a windmill seller,
    and then repurposed into AI spam pages.

    kept the name of a high school band from North Carolina. Karen Jarvis, a spokesperson
    for Davie County Schools, confirmed in an email that the page [Davie High School
    War Eagle Bands](https://www.facebook.com/dhswareaglebands) is now unaffiliated
    with the school, which was forced to create a new page.

    our high school band, and has since become what you see today,” Jarvis wrote.
    “There have been countless attempts (from the band director, school officials,
    current band members, and alumni) to regain control, report the page/images, etc.,
    but Facebook has been non-responsive.”

    baiting gullible users to identify potential scam targets.

    the images are easy to generate, often visually sensational, and attract engagement,”
    the Stanford researchers wrote in their preprint paper.

    a more legitimate appearance, as well as to engage with real commenters, and that
    the scam accounts would sometimes seek personal information from commenters or
    try to sell them fake products.

    commenters, each one using a similar script. One commenter who wrote, “Love it!!
    So cute!!” on an AI-generated image of a [toddler snuggled up in a basket of kittens](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=122142220028086541&set=pb.61552596246305.-2207520000&type=3),
    received a reply within hours from a recently created account under the name Stephen
    Townsend. The account, which did not respond to a request for comment, displayed
    no personal information or posts aside from a profile and a cover photo, both
    of which were uploaded on the same day.

    admire your good sense of humor here. I don’t normally write in the comment section,
    but I think you deserve this compliment,” the profile replied. “I would like to
    be your friend. Kindly send me a friend request please. If you don’t mind. Thank
    you.”

    to comments on popular AI posts, as well as directly on users’ profile pages.
    Some users suspicious that the pages are driving potential scam campaigns are
    also leaving their own comments to warn those who may fail to distinguish certain
    images as AI-generated.

    she noticed them in her feed a few weeks ago, said she now gets AI images like
    those maybe every 10 posts: “I’m scrolling right now. I just got one — that was
    four posts in.”'
