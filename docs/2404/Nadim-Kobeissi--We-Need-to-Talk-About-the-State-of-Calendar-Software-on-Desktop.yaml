    did they end up being so broken on the desktop, *which is where we get work done*,
    except in two specific case scenarios? No, I’m sorry, Thunderbird’s calendar isn’t
    a good calendar. It’s dialog boxes from 1998 coming up with that *“donk!”* sound,
    not being dismissable immediately, and also coming up twice for no reason, or
    telling you that you modified the event when you didn’t. This isn’t what I’m talking
    about when I talk about “good calendaring software”.

    Add to that the fact that web apps really are enough for most everyone out there,
    since they usually only have one calendar to worry about and it’s usually either
    their work calendar or their personal calendar, both provided either by Google,
    Outlook or iCloud.'

    Baal’s Soulstone within himself forever. Who the heck wants that as their fate?
    There are so many better, more well-paying, less onerous and more prestigious
    things to do with your time. It’s almost as bad as writing a mail client. I don’t
    even have the courage to write a *blog post* about the need for better mail clients.

    calendar software for desktops. Aside from Apple’s built-in Calendar app, you
    have [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/) and [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical),
    to name a couple. They command outrageous pricing and sell lots of copies! BusyCal’s
    $49.99, while Fantastical is only available by subscription. BusyCal in particular
    is nuts. Every feature you can think of, every calendaring protocol. It’s world-class
    calendaring software. A real calendaring Cadillac.

    nonsense quagmire where most workstations don’t have good calendars might just
    be for us to roll up our sleeves and dive into the creation of a new open source
    calendar project. The most promising approach is almost certainly leveraging [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
    Why Tauri?

    This is crucial as one of the core frustrations with existing Electron apps is
    their bloated nature and sluggish performance.

    codebase, which simplifies updates and bug fixes.

    calendar software. We can continue to grumble into our coffees each morning or
    we can actually do something about this farce. Seriously, how much longer are
    we willing to tolerate this nonsense? The blueprint is right there: a sleek, multiplatform
    calendar app built on Tauri, waiting to be forged from the fires of our collective
    irritation and genius. If none of this inspires you to action, then maybe continue
    your Sisyphean struggle with whatever archaic tools you’re suffering through.'
