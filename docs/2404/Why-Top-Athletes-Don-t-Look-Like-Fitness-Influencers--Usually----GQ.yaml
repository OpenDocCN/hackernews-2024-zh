- en: Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, or the Kansas City Chiefs' tight end—depending on
    your interests and allegiances—is in his “dad bod era,” according to [*InStyle*](http://instyle.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-dad-b%E2%80%A6).
    This nugget of insight originated from a story published in [*The Daily Mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13246309/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dad-bod-super-bowl-reward.html)
    last week, citing an exclusive insider source who said Swift was “enjoying” Travis
    Kelce’s new figure, which has apparently gained 30 pounds since his Super Bowl
    victory earlier this year. It is good to love your body and your boyfriend’s body.
    But many people—myself included—were confused to see a *key piece of the NFL team
    that won the last Super Bowl* described as having a dadbod.

    about the difference between how a body looks and how it performs, because the
    two are often conflated online.

- en: Top-performing athletes don’t look like fitness influencers. When you don’t
    have a scoreboard to co-sign your ability, influencers often have to rely on their
    appearance. Massive lats and visible veins are used to bolster claims about their
    exclusive workout programs and proprietary supplement blends. And if your Instagram
    feed and FYP are filled with fitness influencers, you might have a warped perspective
    of what performance (and health) look like.

- en: '[Ben Carpenter](https://www.bdccarpenter.com), a personal trainer, author,
    and fitness model, makes this abundantly clear. Addressing a professionally lighted
    image of a ripped six-pack, he said, “This isn’t fitness. This isn’t healthy.”
    It was a photo of *his* abs from his time as a fitness model. “Being really, really
    lean fucking sucks,” he said, as he was perpetually exhausted, constantly hungry,
    and devoid of libido—which shows that optimizing for a good photo can have major
    compromises on your performance, in multiple ways.'

    some help. Winning a bodybuilding competition without steroids is impossible,
    as one expert told the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/bodybuilding-health-risks/)
    in 2022\. And these steroid regimens can have devastating long-term effects, “especially
    in the heart, the reproductive system and the brain.”

- en: Athletes like Kelce, whether on- or off-season, benefit from having much more
    mass than a bodybuilder with single-digit body fat. According to [the National
    Strength and Conditioning Association](https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/kinetic-select/sport-performance-and-body-composition/#:~:text=Although%20lean%20body%20mass%20is,and%20agility%20are%20not%20compromised.),
    athletes like football players “can benefit from mass increases in either form
    (fat included)” because this additional mass can increase their stability. These
    athletes might reduce their weight to increase agility, but that’s going to look
    far less dramatic than a “cut” you see on Instagram.

    how you look on the beach. Obviously you don’t have to choose between trying to
    look good and trying to get stronger (see: any gym, basketball court, swimming
    pool, etc.). But we should be honest about what’s what. Visible abs means little
    more than *works out a lot and probably very hungry.* If you touch grass—perhaps
    a rec soccer pitch—you’ll see that performance will look different on every individual.'
