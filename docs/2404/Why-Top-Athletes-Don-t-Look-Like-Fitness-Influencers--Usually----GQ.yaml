- en: Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, or the Kansas City Chiefs' tight end—depending on
    your interests and allegiances—is in his “dad bod era,” according to [*InStyle*](http://instyle.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-dad-b%E2%80%A6).
    This nugget of insight originated from a story published in [*The Daily Mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13246309/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dad-bod-super-bowl-reward.html)
    last week, citing an exclusive insider source who said Swift was “enjoying” Travis
    Kelce’s new figure, which has apparently gained 30 pounds since his Super Bowl
    victory earlier this year. It is good to love your body and your boyfriend’s body.
    But many people—myself included—were confused to see a *key piece of the NFL team
    that won the last Super Bowl* described as having a dadbod.

  zh: 泰勒·斯威夫特的男友，或者堪萨斯城酋长队的紧密端——根据你的兴趣和忠诚度——正处于他的“老爸体时代”，据[*InStyle*](http://instyle.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-dad-b%E2%80%A6)报道。这一见解的来源是[*每日邮报*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13246309/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-dad-bod-super-bowl-reward.html)上周发布的一篇文章，援引了一位独家内部消息人士的话，称斯威夫特“喜欢”特拉维斯·凯尔斯新的身材，据说自从他今年早些时候的超级碗胜利后增重了30磅。爱你的身体和你男友的身体是件好事。但很多人——包括我自己——看到上一届超级碗冠军NFL球队的*一个关键成员*被描述为有老爸体感到困惑。

    about the difference between how a body looks and how it performs, because the
    two are often conflated online.

  zh: 实际上，这是一个教育性的时刻，我们可以退后一步思考身体外表与表现之间的差异，因为这两者在网上经常混淆。
- en: Top-performing athletes don’t look like fitness influencers. When you don’t
    have a scoreboard to co-sign your ability, influencers often have to rely on their
    appearance. Massive lats and visible veins are used to bolster claims about their
    exclusive workout programs and proprietary supplement blends. And if your Instagram
    feed and FYP are filled with fitness influencers, you might have a warped perspective
    of what performance (and health) look like.

  zh: 高水平的运动员看起来并不像健身网红。当你没有一个记分牌来证明你的能力时，网红通常必须依赖他们的外貌。巨大的背阔肌和可见的静脉被用来支持他们独家的锻炼计划和专有的补充剂混合物的声明。如果你的Instagram动态和FYP充斥着健身网红，你可能对表现（和健康）的看法扭曲了。
- en: '[Ben Carpenter](https://www.bdccarpenter.com), a personal trainer, author,
    and fitness model, makes this abundantly clear. Addressing a professionally lighted
    image of a ripped six-pack, he said, “This isn’t fitness. This isn’t healthy.”
    It was a photo of *his* abs from his time as a fitness model. “Being really, really
    lean fucking sucks,” he said, as he was perpetually exhausted, constantly hungry,
    and devoid of libido—which shows that optimizing for a good photo can have major
    compromises on your performance, in multiple ways.'

- en: And those hulking influencers curling in the squat rack of your mind often have
    some help. Winning a bodybuilding competition without steroids is impossible,
    as one expert told the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/bodybuilding-health-risks/)
    in 2022\. And these steroid regimens can have devastating long-term effects, “especially
    in the heart, the reproductive system and the brain.”

  zh: 那些在你脑海中扭曲深蹲架的庞大网红们通常有所帮助。像一位专家在2022年告诉[*华盛顿邮报*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/bodybuilding-health-risks/)的那样，要想在没有类固醇的情况下赢得健美比赛是不可能的。而这些类固醇疗程可能会对心脏、生殖系统和大脑“尤其是”造成毁灭性的长期影响。
- en: Athletes like Kelce, whether on- or off-season, benefit from having much more
    mass than a bodybuilder with single-digit body fat. According to [the National
    Strength and Conditioning Association](https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/kinetic-select/sport-performance-and-body-composition/#:~:text=Although%20lean%20body%20mass%20is,and%20agility%20are%20not%20compromised.),
    athletes like football players “can benefit from mass increases in either form
    (fat included)” because this additional mass can increase their stability. These
    athletes might reduce their weight to increase agility, but that’s going to look
    far less dramatic than a “cut” you see on Instagram.

  zh: 像凯尔斯这样的运动员，无论是赛季内还是赛季外，都因拥有比身体脂肪单位数字更多的质量而受益。根据[国家力量与体能协会](https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/kinetic-select/sport-performance-and-body-composition/#:~:text=Although%20lean%20body%20mass%20is,and%20agility%20are%20not%20compromised.)的说法，像足球运动员这样的运动员“可以从任何形式的质量增加中受益（包括脂肪）”，因为这种额外的质量可以增强他们的稳定性。这些运动员可能会减轻体重以增加敏捷性，但与你在Instagram上看到的“减脂”相比，效果远没有那么惊人。
- en: 'It’s a personal decision on whether you want to go all-in on performance or
    how you look on the beach. Obviously you don’t have to choose between trying to
    look good and trying to get stronger (see: any gym, basketball court, swimming
    pool, etc.). But we should be honest about what’s what. Visible abs means little
    more than *works out a lot and probably very hungry.* If you touch grass—perhaps
    a rec soccer pitch—you’ll see that performance will look different on every individual.'

  zh: 这是一个个人决定，你是想全力追求表现，还是在海滩上的外观。显然，你不必在试图变得好看和试图变得更强之间做出选择（参见：任何健身房、篮球场、游泳池等）。但是我们应该诚实地面对现实。明显的腹肌仅仅意味着*经常锻炼，可能非常饥饿*。如果你接触过草地——也许是一个休闲足球场——你会看到不同个体的表现会有所不同。
